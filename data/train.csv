1931,1932,push me up versh,your paw told you to stay out that tree,faulkner
1933,1934,versh said,that was a long time ago,faulkner

1937,1938,besides he said to mind me tonight,did not he did not he say to mind me tonight,faulkner

1947,1948,versh said,you the one going to get whipped,faulkner
1949,1950,i aint,he went and pushed caddy up into the tree to the first limb,faulkner
1951,1952,we watched the muddy bottom of her drawers,then we could not see her,faulkner
1953,1954,we could hear the tree thrashing,mr jason said if you break that tree he whip you,faulkner
1955,1956,versh said,i am going to tell on her too,faulkner
1957,1958,jason said,the tree quit thrashing,faulkner
1959,1960,we looked up into the still branches,what you seeing,faulkner
1961,1962,frony whispered,i saw them,faulkner
1963,1964,then i saw caddy with flowers in her hair and a long veil like shining wind,caddy caddy hush,faulkner
1965,1966,t,p,faulkner

1977,1978,he said,hush,faulkner
1979,1980,come on here quick,he pulled me on,faulkner

1985,1986,we can say dan drank it,mr quentin always saying he so smart we can say he sassprilluh dog too,faulkner
1987,1988,the moonlight came down the cellar stairs,we drank some more sassprilluh,faulkner
1989,1990,you know what i wish,t,faulkner
1991,1992,p,said,faulkner
1993,1994,i wish a bear would walk in that cellar door,you know what i do,faulkner
1995,1996,i walk right up to him and spit in he eye,gimme that bottle to stop my mouth before i holler,faulkner
1997,1998,t,p,faulkner
1999,2000,fell down,he began to laugh and the cellar door and the moonlight jumped away and something hit me,faulkner
2001,2002,he had lost his magic,the impulse was spent,routh
2003,2004,he had never failed in the theater everything he had done had been strong and successful and then the terrible thing happened he could not act,going onstage became agony,routh
2005,2006,instead of the certainty that he was going to be wonderful he knew he was going to fail,it happened three times in a row and by the last time nobody was interested nobody came,routh
2007,2008,he could not get over to the audience,his talent was dead,routh
2009,2010,of course if you have had it you always have something unlike anyone else is,i will always be unlike anyone else axler told himself because i am who i am,routh
2011,2012,i carry that with methat people will always remember,but the aura he had had all his mannerisms and eccentricities and personal peculiarities what had worked for falstaff and peer gynt and vanyawhat had gained simon axler his reputation as the last of the best of the classical american stage actorsnone of it worked for any role now,routh
2013,2014,all that had worked to make him himself now worked to make him look like a lunatic,he was conscious of every moment he was on the stage in the worst possible way,routh
2015,2016,in the past when he was acting he was not thinking about anything,what he did well he did out of instinct,routh
2017,2018,now he was thinking about everything and everything spontaneous and vital was killedhe tried to control it with thinking and instead he destroyed it,all right axler told himself he had hit a bad period,routh
2019,2020,though he was already in his sixties maybe it would pass while he was still recognizably himself,he would not be the first experienced actor to go through it,routh
2021,2022,a lot of people did,i have done this before he thought so i will find some way,routh
2023,2024,i do not know how i am going to get it this time but i will find itthis will pass,it did not pass,routh
2025,2026,he could not act,the ways he could once rivet attention on the stage,routh
2027,2028,and now he dreaded every performance and dreaded it all day long,he spent the entire day thinking thoughts he had never thought before a performance in his life i wo not make it i wo not be able to do it i am playing the wrong roles i am overreaching i am faking i have no idea even of how to do the first line,routh
2029,2030,and meanwhile he tried to occupy the hours doing a hundred seemingly necessary things to prepare i have to look at this speech again i have to rest i have to exercise i have to look at that speech again and by the time he got to the theater he was exhausted,and dreading going out there,routh
2031,2032,he would hear the cue coming closer and closer and know that he could not do it,he waited for the freedom to begin and the moment to become real he waited to forget who he was and to become the person doing it but instead he was standing there completely empty doing the kind of acting you do when you do not know what you are doing,routh
2033,2034,he could not give and he could not withhold he had no fluidity and he had no reserve,acting became a nightafternight exercise in trying to get away with something,routh
2035,2036,it had started with people speaking to him,he could not have been more than three or four when he was already mesmerized by speaking and being spoken to,routh
2037,2038,he had felt he was in a play from the outset,he could use intensity of listening concentration as lesser actors used fireworks,routh
2039,2040,he had that power offstage too particularly when younger with women who did not realize that they had a story until he revealed to them that they had a story a voice and a style belonging to no other,they became actresses with axler they became the heroines of their own lives,routh
2041,2042,few stage actors could speak and be spoken to the way he could yet he could do neither anymore,the sound that used to go into his ear felt as though it were going out and every word he uttered seemed acted instead of spoken,routh
2043,2044,the initial source in his acting was in what he heard his response to what he heard was at the core of it and if he could not listen could not hear he had nothing to go on,he was asked to play prospero and macbeth at the kennedy centerit was hard to think of a more ambitious double billand he failed appallingly in both but especially as macbeth,routh
2045,2046,he could not do lowintensity shakespeare and he could not do highintensity shakespeareand he had been doing shakespeare all his life,his macbeth was ludicrous and everyone who saw it said as much and so did many who had not seen it,routh
2047,2048,no they do not even have to have been there he said to insult you,a lot of actors would have turned to drink to help themselves out an old joke had it that there was an actor who would always drink before he went onstage and when he was warned you must not drink he replied what and go out there alone,routh
2049,2050,but axler did not drink and so he collapsed instead,his breakdown was colossal,routh
2051,2052,the worst of it was that he saw through his breakdown the same way he could see through his acting,the suffering was excruciating and yet he doubted that it was genuine which made it even worse,routh
2053,2054,he did not know how he was going to get from one minute to the next his mind felt as though it were melting he was terrified to be alone he could not sleep more than two or three hours a night he scarcely ate he thought every day of killing himself with the gun in the attica remington 870 pumpaction shotgun that he kept in the isolated farmhouse for selfdefenseand still the whole thing seemed to be an act a bad act,when you are playing the role of somebody coming apart it has organization and order when you are observing yourself coming apart playing the role of your own demise that is something else something awash with terror and fear,routh
2055,2056,he could not convince himself he was mad any more than he had been able to convince himself or anyone else he was prospero or macbeth,he was an artificial madman too,routh
2057,2058,the only role available to him was the role of someone playing a role,a sane man playing an insane man,routh
2059,2060,a stable man playing a broken man,a selfcontrolled man playing a man out of control,routh
2061,2062,a man of solid achievement of theatrical renowna large burly actor standing six feet four inches tall with a big bald head and the strong hairy body of a brawler with a face that could convey so much a decisive jaw and stern dark eyes and a sizable mouth he could twist every which way and a low commanding voice emanating from deep down that always had a little growl in it a man conscientiously on the grand scale who looked as if he could stand up to anything and easily fulfill all of a man is roles the embodiment of invulnerable resistance who looked to have absorbed into his being the egoism of a dependable giantplaying an insignificant mite,he screamed aloud when he awakened in the night and found himself still locked inside the role of the man deprived of himself his talent and his place in the world a loathsome man who was nothing more than the inventory of his defects,routh
2063,2064,in the mornings he hid in bed for hours but instead of hiding from the role he was merely playing the role,and when finally he got up all he could think about was suicide and not its simulation either,routh
2065,2066,a man who wanted to live playing a man who wanted to die,meanwhile prospero is most famous words would not let him be perhaps because he had so recently mangled them,routh
2067,2068,they repeated themselves so regularly in his head that they soon became a hubbub of sounds tortuously empty of meaning and pointing at no reality yet carrying the force of a spell full of personal significance,our revels now are ended,routh
2069,2070,these our actors  as i foretold you were all spirits and  are melted into air into thin air,he could do nothing to blot out thin air the two syllables that were chaotically repeated while he lay powerless in his bed in the morning and that had the aura of an obscure indictment even as they came to make less and less sense,routh
2071,2072,his whole intricate personality was entirely at the mercy of thin air,victoria axler is wife could no longer care for him and by now needed tending herself,routh
2073,2074,she would cry whenever she saw him at the kitchen table his head in his hands unable to eat the meal she had prepared,try something she begged but he ate nothing said nothing and soon victoria began to panic,routh
2075,2076,she had never seen him give way like this before not even eight years earlier when his elderly parents had died in an automobile crash with his father at the wheel,he wept then and he went on,routh
2077,2078,he always went on,he took the losses hard but the performance never faltered,routh
2079,2080,and when victoria was in turmoil it was he who kept her tough and got her through,there was always a drug drama with her errant son,routh
2081,2082,there was the permanent hardship of aging and the end of her career,so much disappointment but he was there and so she could bear it,routh
2083,2084,if only he were here now that the man on whom she had depended was gone,in the 1950s victoria powers had been balanchine is youngest favorite,routh
2085,2086,then she hurt her knee had an operation danced again hurt it again had another operation and by the time she was rehabilitated the second time round someone else was balanchine is youngest favorite,she never recovered her place,routh
2087,2088,there was a marriage the son a divorce a second marriage a second divorce and then she met and fell in love with simon axler who when he had first come from college two decades earlier to make a career on the new york stage used to go to the city center to see her dance not because he loved ballet but because of his youthful susceptibility to the capacity she had to stir him to lust through the pathway of the tenderest emotions she remained in his memory for years afterward as the very incarnation of erotic pathos,when they met as fortyyearolds in the late seventies it was a long time since anyone had asked her to perform though pluckily she went off every day to her workout at a local dance studio,routh
2089,2090,she had done all she could to keep herself fit and looking youthful but by then her pathos exceeded any ability she had ever had to master it artistically,after the kennedy center debacle and his unexpected collapse victoria fell apart and fled to california to be close to her son,routh
2091,2092,all at once axler was alone in the house in the country and terrified of killing himself,now there was nothing stopping him,routh
2093,2094,now he could go ahead and do what he had found himself unable to do while she was still there walk up the stairs to the attic load the gun put the barrel in his mouth and reach down with his long arms to pull the trigger,the gun as the sequel to the wife,routh
2095,2096,but once she had left he did not make it through the first hour alonedid not even go up the first flight of stairs toward the atticbefore he had phoned his doctor and asked him to arrange for his admission to a psychiatric hospital that very day,within only minutes the doctor had found him a place at hammerton a small hospital with a good reputation a few hours to the north,routh
2097,2098,he was there for twentysix days,once interviewed unpacked relieved of his sharps by a nurse and his valuables taken to the business office for safekeeping once alone and in the room assigned him he sat down on the bed and remembered role after role that he had played with absolute assurance since he had become a professional in his early twentieswhat had destroyed his confidence now,routh
2099,2100,what was he doing in this hospital room,a selftravesty had come into being who did not exist before a selftravesty grounded in nothing and he was that selftravesty and how had it happened,routh
2101,2102,was it purely the passage of time bringing on decay and collapse,was it a manifestation of aging,routh
2103,2104,his appearance was still impressive,his aims as an actor had not changed nor had his painstaking manner of preparation for a role,routh
2105,2106,there was no one more thorough and studious and serious no one who took better care of his talent or who better accommodated himself to the changing conditions of a career in the theater over so many decades,to cease so precipitously being the actor he wasit was inexplicable as though he had been disarmed of the weight and substance of his professional existence one night while he slept,routh
2107,2108,the ability to speak and be spoken to on a stagethat is what it came down to and that is what was gone,the psychiatrist he saw dr,routh
2109,2110,farr questioned whether what had befallen him could truly be causeless and in their twiceweekly sessions asked him to examine the circumstances of his life preceding the sudden onset of what the doctor described as a universal nightmare,by this he meant that the actor is misfortune in the theatergoing out on the stage and finding himself unable to perform the shock of that losswas the content of troubling dreams any number of people had about themselves people who unlike simon axler were not professional actors,routh
2111,2112,going out on the stage and being unable to perform was among the stock set of dreams that most every patient reported at one time or another,that and walking naked down a busy city street or being unprepared for a crucial exam or falling off a cliff or finding on the highway that your brakes do not work,routh
2113,2114,dr,farr asked axler to talk about his marriage about his parents death about his relations with his drugaddicted stepson his boyhood his adolescence his beginnings as an actor an older sister who had died of lupus when he was twenty,routh
2115,2116,the doctor wanted to hear in particular detail about the weeks and months leading up to his appearance at the kennedy center and to know if he remembered anything out of the ordinary large or small occurring during that period,axler worked hard to be truthful and thereby to reveal the origins of his conditionand with that to recover his powersbut as far as he could tell no cause for the universal nightmare presented itself in anything he said sitting across from the sympathetic and attentive psychiatrist,routh
2117,2118,and that made it all the more a nightmare,yet he talked to the doctor anyway each time he showed up,routh
2119,2120,why not,at a certain stage of misery you will try anything to explain what is going on with you even if you know it does not explain a thing and it is one failed explanation after another,routh
2121,2122,some twenty days into his stay at the hospital a night came when instead of waking at two or three and lying sleepless in the midst of his terror till dawn he slept right through until eight in the morning so late by hospital standards that a nurse had to come to his room to awaken him so that he could join the other patients for 745 breakfast in the dining hall and then begin the day which included group therapy art therapy a consultation with dr,farr and a session with the physical therapist who was doing her best to treat his perennial spinal pain,routh
2123,2124,every waking hour was filled with activities and appointments to prevent the patients from retiring to their rooms to lie depressed and miserable on their beds or to sit around with one another as a number of them did in the evenings anyway discussing the ways they had tried to kill themselves,several times he sat in the corner of the rec room with the small gang of suicidal patients and listened to them recalling the ardor with which they had planned to die and bemoaning how they had failed,routh
2125,2126,each of them remained immersed in the magnitude of his or her suicide attempt and the ignominy of having survived it,that people could really do it that they could control their own death was a source of fascination to them allit was their natural subject like boys talking about sports,routh
2127,2128,several described feeling something akin to the rush that a psychopath must get when he kills someone else sweeping over them when they attempted to kill themselves,a young woman said you seem to yourself and to everyone around you paralyzed and wholly ineffectual and yet you can decide to commit the most difficult act there is,routh
2129,2130,it is exhilarating,it is invigorating,routh
2131,2132,it is euphoric,yes said someone else there is a grim euphoria to it,routh
2133,2134,your life is falling apart it has no center and suicide is the one thing you can control,one elderly man a retired schoolteacher who had tried to hang himself in his garage gave them a lecture on the ways outsiders think about suicide,routh
2135,2136,the one thing that everyone wants to do with suicide is explain it,explain it and judge it,routh
2137,2138,it is so appalling for the people that are left behind that there has to be a way of thinking about it,some people think of it as an act of cowardice,routh
2139,2140,some people think of it as criminal as a crime against the survivors,another school of thought finds it heroic and an act of courage,routh
2141,2142,then there are the purists,the question for them is was it justified was there sufficient cause,routh
2143,2144,the more clinical point of view which is neither punitive nor idealizing is the psychologist is which attempts to describe the state of mind of the suicide what state of mind he was in when he did it,he went tediously on in this vein more or less every night as though he were not an anguished patient like the rest of them but a guest lecturer who had been brought in to elucidate the subject that obsessed them night and day,routh
2145,2146,one evening axler spoke upto perform he realized before his largest audience since he had given up acting,suicide is the role you write for yourself he told them,routh
2147,2148,you inhabit it and you enact it,all carefully stagedwhere they will find you and how they will find you,routh
2149,2150,then he added but one performance only,in their conversation everything private was revealed easily and shamelessly suicide seemed like a very huge aim and living a hateful condition,routh
2151,2152,among the patients he met there were some who knew him right off because of his handful of movies but they were too immersed in their own struggles to take much more notice of him than they did of anyone other than themselves,and the staff was too busy to be distracted for long by his theatrical renown,routh
2153,2154,he was all but unrecognizable in the hospital not only to others but to himself,from the moment that he had rediscovered the miracle of a night is sleep and had to be awakened for breakfast by the nurse he began to feel the dread subside,routh
2155,2156,they had given him one medication for depression that did not agree with him then a second and finally a third that caused no intolerable side effects but whether it did him any good he could not tell,he could not believe that his improvement had anything to do with pills or with psychiatric consultations or group therapy or art therapy all of which felt like empty exercises,routh
2157,2158,what continued to frighten him as the day of his discharge approached was that nothing that was happening to him seemed to have to do with anything else,as he had told dr,routh
2159,2160,farrand further convinced himself by having tried to the best of his ability to search for a cause during their sessionshe had lost his magic as an actor for no good reason and it was just as arbitrarily that the desire to end his life began to ebb at least for the time being,nothing has a good reason for happening he said to the doctor later that day,routh
2161,2162,you lose you gainit is all caprice,the omnipotence of caprice,routh
2163,2164,the likelihood of reversal,yes the unpredictable reversal and its power,routh
2165,2166,near the end of his stay he made a friend and each night they had dinner together she repeated her story to him,he had met her first in art therapy and after that they would sit across from each other at a table for two in the dining hall chatting like a couple on a date orgiven the thirtyyear age differencelike a father and daughter albeit about her suicide attempt,routh
2167,2168,the day they meta couple of days after her arrivalthere had been only the two of them in the art room along with the therapist who as though they were kindergarteners had handed each sheets of white paper and a box of crayons to play with and told them to draw whatever they wanted,all that was missing from the room he thought were the little tables and chairs,routh
2169,2170,to satisfy the therapist they worked in silence for fifteen minutes and then again for the sake of the therapist listened attentively to the response each offered to the other is drawing,she had drawn a house and a garden and he a picture of himself drawing a picture a picture he told the therapist when she asked him what he had done of a man who has broken down and who commits himself to a psychiatric hospital and goes to art therapy and is asked there by the therapist to draw a picture,routh
2171,2172,and suppose you were to give your picture a title simon,what would it be,routh
2173,2174,that is easy,what the hell am i doing here,routh
2175,2176,the five other patients scheduled to be at art therapy either were back on their beds unable to do anything except lie there and weep or as though an emergency had befallen them had rushed off without an appointment to their doctors offices and were sitting in the waiting room preparing to lament over the wife the husband the child the boss the mother the father the boyfriend the girlfriendwhomever it was they never wanted to see again or whom they would be willing to see again so long as the doctor was present and there was no shouting or violence or threats of violence or whom they missed horribly and could not live without and whom they would do anything to get back,each of them sat waiting a turn to denounce a parent to vilify a sibling to belittle a mate to vindicate or excoriate or pity themselves,routh
2177,2178,one or two of them who could still concentrateor pretend to concentrate or strain to concentrateon something other than the misery of their grievance would while waiting for the doctor leaf through a copy of time or sports illustrated or pick up the local paper and try to do the crossword puzzle,everybody else would be sitting there gloomily silent inwardly intense and rehearsing to themselvesin the lexicon of pop psychology or gutter obscenity or christian suffering or paranoid pathologythe ancient themes of dramatic literature incest betrayal injustice cruelty vengeance jealousy rivalry desire loss dishonor and grief,routh
2179,2180,she was an elfin paleskinned brunette with the bony frailty of a sickly girl of about a quarter her age,her name was sybil van buren,routh
2181,2182,in the eyes of the actor hers was a thirtyfiveyearold body that not only refused to be strong but dreaded even the appearance of strength,and yet for all her delicacy she had said to him on the way up the path to the main residence hall from art therapy will you eat dinner with me simon,routh
2183,2184,amazing,still some kind of wish in her not to be swallowed up,routh
2185,2186,or maybe she had asked to stay on at his side in the hope that with a little luck something would ignite between them that would complete the doing in of her,he was big enough for the job more than whale enough for a tiny bundle of flotsam like her,routh
2187,2188,even herewhere without assistance from the pharmacopoeia any show of stability let alone bravado was unlikely to quell for long the maelstrom of terror swirling back of the gullethe had not lost the loose swaggering gait of the ominous man that had once gone toward making him such an original othello,and so yes if there was still any hope for her of going completely under perhaps it lay in cozying up to him,routh
2189,2190,that is what he thought at the outset anyway,i had lived for so long in the constraints of caution sybil told him at dinner that first night,routh
2191,2192,the efficient housewife who gardens and sews and can repair everything and throws glorious dinner parties as well,the quiet steady loyal sidekick of the rich and powerful man with her unambiguous wholehearted oldfashioned devotion to the rearing of children,routh
2193,2194,the ordinary existence of an insignificant mortal,well i went off to go shopping for grocerieswhat could be more mundane than that,routh
2195,2196,why would anyone in the world have to worry about that,i had left my daughter playing out back in the yard and our little boy upstairs sleeping in his crib and my rich and powerful second husband watching a golf tournament on tv,routh
2197,2198,i turned around and came home because when i got to the supermarket i realized i had forgotten my wallet,the little one was still sleeping,routh
2199,2200,and in the living room the golf game was still going but my eightyearold daughter my little alison was sitting up on the sofa without her underpants and my rich and powerful second husband was kneeling on the floor his head between her plump little legs,what was he doing there,routh
2201,2202,what men do there,axler watched her cry and said nothing,routh
2203,2204,you have seen my artwork she finally told him,the sun shining down on a pretty house and the garden all in bloom,routh
2205,2206,you know me,everybody knows me,routh
2207,2208,i think the best of everything,i prefer it that way and so does everyone around me,routh
2209,2210,he got up off his knees completely unruffled and told me that she had been complaining about an itch and she would not stop scratching herself and so before she did herself any harm he had taken a look to be sure she was all right,and she was he assured me,routh
2211,2212,he could see nothing not a blemish not a sore not a rash,she was fine,routh
2213,2214,good i said,i came back for my wallet,routh
2215,2216,and instead of getting his hunting rifle from the basement and pumping him full of bullets i found my wallet in the kitchen said bye again everyone and went off to the store as if what i had witnessed was a commonplace occurrence,in a daze dumbfounded i filled two shopping carts,routh
2217,2218,i would have filled two more four more six more if the store manager had not seen me blubbering away and come over to ask if i was all right,he drove me home in his car,routh
2219,2220,i left our car in the lot there and was driven home,i could not negotiate the stairs,routh
2221,2222,i had to be carried up to bed,there i lay for four days unable to speak or eat barely able to drag myself to the bathroom,routh
2223,2224,the story was that i had come down with a fever and been ordered to bed,my rich and powerful second husband could not have been more solicitous,routh
2225,2226,my little darling alison sweetly brought me a vase of cut flowers from my garden,i could not ask her i could not bring myself to say who removed your underpants,routh
2227,2228,what do you want to tell me,if you really had some kind of itch you would have waited would not you until i came home from shopping to show me,routh
2229,2230,but dear if you did not have an itch,dear if there is something you are not telling me because you are afraid to,routh
2231,2232,,,routh
2233,2234,,but i was the one who was afraid,routh
2235,2236,i could not do it,by the fourth day i had convinced myself that i had imagined everything and two weeks later when alison was at school and he was at work and the little one was taking his nap i got out the wine and the valium and the plastic garbage bag,routh
2237,2238,but i could not stand suffocating,i panicked,routh
2239,2240,i took the pills and the wine but then i remember not getting any air and hurrying to rip the bag off,and i do not know what i regret more horriblyhaving tried to do it or having failed to do it,routh
2241,2242,all i want to do is shoot him,only now he is alone with them and i am here,routh
2243,2244,he is all alone with my sweet little girl,it ca not be,routh
2245,2246,i called my sister and asked her to stay at the house with them but he would not let her sleep there,he said there was no need,routh
2247,2248,and so she left,and what can i do,routh
2249,2250,i am here and alison is there,i was paralyzed,routh
2251,2252,i did nothing that i should have done,nothing that anyone would have done,routh
2253,2254,i should have rushed the child to the doctor,i should have called the police,routh
2255,2256,it was a criminal act,there are laws against such things,routh
2257,2258,instead i did nothing,but he said nothing had happened you see,routh
2259,2260,he says that i am hysterical that i am deluded that i am mad but i am not,i swear to you simon i am not mad,routh
2261,2262,i saw him doing it,that is horrible,routh
2263,2264,a horrible transgression axler said,i see why it is done what it did to you,routh
2265,2266,it is evil,i need someone she confided in a murmur to kill this evil man,routh
2267,2268,i am sure you could find a willing party,you,routh
2269,2270,asked sybil in a tiny voice,i had pay,routh
2271,2272,if i was a killer i would do it pro bono he said taking the hand she extended to him,people become infected with the rage when an innocent child is violated,routh
2273,2274,but i am an outofwork actor,i had botch the job and we had both go to jail,routh
2275,2276,oh what should i do,she asked him,routh
2277,2278,what would you do,get strong,routh
2279,2280,cooperate with the doctor and try to get strong as fast as you can so you can go home to your children,you believe me do not you,routh
2281,2282,i am sure you saw what you saw,can we have dinner together,routh
2283,2284,for as long as i am here he said,i knew in art therapy that you had understand,routh
2285,2286,there is so much suffering in your eyes,within months of his leaving the hospital his wife is son died of an overdose and the marriage of the occupationless dancer to the occupationless actor ended in divorce completing yet one more of the many millions of stories of unhappily entwined men and women,routh
2287,2288,one day around noon a black town car pulled into the driveway and parked beside the barn,it was a chauffeurdriven mercedes and the small whitehaired man who stepped out of the back seat was jerry oppenheim his agent,routh
2289,2290,after the hospital internment jerry had phoned him every week from new york to see how he was doing but many months had gone by without their speakingthe actor having chosen at one point to stop taking the agent is calls along with most everyone else isand the visit was unexpected,he watched jerry who was over eighty and walked cautiously negotiate the stone path to the front door a package in one hand and flowers in the other,routh
2291,2292,he opened the door before jerry even had a chance to knock,suppose i had not been home,routh
2293,2294,he said helping jerry over the sill,i took my chances jerry said smiling gently,routh
2295,2296,he had a gentle face altogether and a courteous demeanor that did not however compromise his tenacity in behalf of his clients,well you seem all right physically at least,routh
2297,2298,except for that hopeless look on your face simon you do not look bad at all,and youneat as a pin axler said having himself neither changed his clothes nor shaved for days,routh
2299,2300,i brought you flowers,i brought us a box lunch from dean and deluca,routh
2301,2302,have you had lunch,he had not even had breakfast so he merely shrugged and took the gifts and helped jerry out of his coat,routh
2303,2304,you drove up from new york he said,yes,routh
2305,2306,to see how you are doing and talk to you facetoface,i have news for you,routh
2307,2308,the guthrie is doing long day is journey,they called to ask about you,routh
2309,2310,why me,i ca not act jerry and everyone knows it,routh
2311,2312,nobody knows any such thing,perhaps people know that you had an emotional setback but that does not set you apart from the human race,routh
2313,2314,they are doing the play next winter,it gets awfully cold out there but you had be a wonderful james tyrone,routh
2315,2316,james tyrone is a lot of lines that you have to say and i ca not say them,james tyrone is a character that you have to be and i ca not be him,routh
2317,2318,there is no way i can play james tyrone,i ca not play anyone,routh
2319,2320,look you took a tumble in washington,that happens to practically everyone sooner or later,routh
2321,2322,there is no ironclad security in any art,people run into an obstacle for reasons no one knows,routh
2323,2324,but the obstacle is a temporary impediment,the obstacle disappears and you go on,routh
2325,2326,there is not a firstrate actor who has not felt discouraged and that his career was over and that he was unable to come out of the bad period he was in,there is not an actor who has not gone up in the middle of a speech and not known where he was,routh
2327,2328,but every time you go out on the stage there is a new chance,actors can recover their talent,routh
2329,2330,you do not lose the skills if you have been out there for forty years,you still know how to enter and sit down in a chair,routh
2331,2332,john gielgud used to say that there were times he wished he were like a painter or a writer,then he could retrieve the bad performance he gave that evening and take it out at midnight and redo it,routh
2333,2334,but he could not,he had to do it there,routh
2335,2336,gielgud went through a very bad time when he could do nothing right,so did olivier,routh
2337,2338,olivier went through a terrible period,he had a terrible problem,routh
2339,2340,he could not look any of the other actors in the eye,he told the other actors please do not look at me because it will throw me,routh
2341,2342,for a while he could not be alone on the stage,he said to the other actors  hado not leave me alone out there,routh
2343,2344,i know the stories jerry,i have heard them all,routh
2345,2346,they do not have to do with me,in the past i never had more than two or three bad nights when i could not recover,routh
2347,2348,for two or three nights i would think i know i am good i am just not doing it,maybe nobody in the audience knew it but i knew itit was not there,routh
2349,2350,and on those nights when it is not there for you it is a labor i know that and yet somehow you get by,you can get very good at getting by on what you get by on when you do not have anything else,routh
2351,2352,but that is something different entirely,when i had a truly wretched performance i would lie awake all night afterward thinking i have lost it i have no talent i ca not do anything,routh
2353,2354,hours would go by but then all of a sudden at five or six in the morning i had understand what went wrong and i could not wait to get to the theater that evening and go on,and i had go on and i could not make a mistake,routh
2355,2356,a beautiful feeling,there are days when you ca not wait to get there when the marriage between you and the role is perfect and there is never a time when you are not happy to sail out onto the stage,routh
2357,2358,those are important days,and for years i had them one after the other,routh
2359,2360,well that is over,now if i were to go out on the stage i would not know what i was out there for,routh
2361,2362,would not know where to begin,in the old days i had do three hours of preparation in the theater for an eight oclock curtain,routh
2363,2364,by eight i was deeply inside that roleit was like a trance like a useful trance,in the family reunion i was in the theater two and a half hours before the first entrance working up to how to enter when you are pursued by the furies,routh
2365,2366,that was hard for me but i did it,you can do it again jerry said,routh
2367,2368,you are forgetting who you are and what you have achieved,your life has hardly come to nothing,routh
2369,2370,endlessly you would do things on the stage in a way i never expected and over the years that was thrilling thousands of times for the audience and always thrilling for me,you went as far away as possible from the obvious thing that any other actor would do,routh
2371,2372,you could not be routine,you wanted to go everywhere,routh
2373,2374,out out out as far out as you could go,and the audience believed in you in every moment wherever you took them,routh
2375,2376,sure nothing is permanently established but so is nothing permanently lost,your talent is been mislaid that is all,routh
2377,2378,no it is gone jerry,i ca not do any of it again,routh
2379,2380,you are either free or you are not,you are either free and it is genuine it is real it is alive or it is nothing,routh
2381,2382,i am not free anymore,okay let is have some lunch then,routh
2383,2384,and put the flowers in some water,the house looks fine,routh
2385,2386,you look fine,a little too slimmed down i would say but you still look like yourself,routh
2387,2388,you are eating i hope,i eat,routh
2389,2390,but when they sat down to lunch in the kitchen with the flowers in a vase between them axler was unable to eat,he saw himself stepping out on the stage to play james tyrone and the audience bursting into laughter,routh
2391,2392,the anxiety and fear were as naked as that,people would laugh at him because it was him,routh
2393,2394,what do you do with the days,jerry asked,routh
2395,2396,walk,sleep,routh
2397,2398,stare into space,try to read,routh
2399,2400,try to forget myself for at least one minute of each hour,i watch the news,routh
2401,2402,i am up to date on the news,who do you see,routh
2403,2404,you,this is no way for someone of your accomplishment to live,routh
2405,2406,you were kind to come all the way out here jerry but i ca not do the play at the guthrie,i am finished with all that,routh
2407,2408,you are not,you are scared of failing,routh
2409,2410,but that is behind you,you do not realize how onesided and monomaniacal your perspective has become,routh
2411,2412,did i write the reviews,did this monomaniac write those reviews,routh
2413,2414,did i write what they wrote about my macbeth,i was ludicrous and they said as much,routh
2415,2416,i would just think i got through that line thank god i got through that line,i would try to think that was not as bad as last night when in fact it was worse,routh
2417,2418,everything i did was false raucous,i heard this horrible tone in my voice and yet nothing could stop me from fucking up,routh
2419,2420,hideous,hideous,routh
2421,2422,i never gave a good performance not one,so you could not do macbeth to your satisfaction,routh
2423,2424,well you are not the first,he is a horrible person for an actor to live with,routh
2425,2426,i defy anyone to play him and not be warped by the effort,he is a murderer he is a killer,routh
2427,2428,everything is magnified in that play,frankly i never understood all that evil,routh
2429,2430,forget macbeth,forget those reviews jerry said,routh
2431,2432,it is time to move on,you should come down to new york and begin to work in his studio with vincent daniels,routh
2433,2434,you wo not be the first whose confidence he is restored,look you have done all that tough stuff shakespeare the classicsthere is no way this can happen to you with your biography,routh
2435,2436,it is a momentary loss of confidence,it is not a matter of confidence replied axler,routh
2437,2438,i always had a sneaking suspicion that i have no talent whatsoever,well that is nonsense,routh
2439,2440,that is the depression talking,you hear actors saying it a lot when they are down the way you are,routh
2441,2442,i do not have any real talent,i can memorize the lines,routh
2443,2444,that is about it,i have heard it a thousand times,routh
2445,2446,no listen to me,when i was fully honest with myself i had think okay all right i have a modicum of talent or i can at least imitate a talented person,routh
2447,2448,but it was all a fluke jerry a fluke that a talent was given to me a fluke that it was taken away,this life is a fluke from start to finish,routh
2449,2450,oh stop this simon,you can still hold attention the way a big star actor does on the stage,routh
2451,2452,you are a titan for god is sake,no it is a matter of falseness sheer falseness so pervasive that all i can do is stand on the stage and tell the audience i am a liar,routh
2453,2454,and i ca not even lie well,i am a fraud,routh
2455,2456,and that is more nonsense,think for a moment of all the bad actorsthere are lots of them and they somehow get by,routh
2457,2458,so to tell me that simon axler jerry said with his talent ca not get by is absurd,i have seen you in the past times when you were not so happy times when you were in psychic torment in every other way but put a script in front of you allow you to access this thing that you do so wonderfully allow you to become another person and always it is been liberating for you,routh
2459,2460,well that is happened before and it can happen again,the love of what you do wellit can return and it will return,routh
2461,2462,look vincent daniels is an ace at dealing with problems like yours a tough canny intuitive teacher highly intelligent and a scrapper himself,i know his name he told jerry,routh
2463,2464,but i have never met him,i never had to meet him,routh
2465,2466,he is a maverick he is a scrapper and he will get you back to contending,he will put the fight back in you,routh
2467,2468,he will start from scratch if he has to,he will get you to give up everything you have done before if he must,routh
2469,2470,it will be a struggle but in the end he will get you back to where you should be,i have been to his studio and watched vincent work,routh
2471,2472,he says  hado one moment,we are only dealing with the single moment,routh
2473,2474,play the moment play whatever plays for you in that moment and then go on to the next moment,it does not matter where you are going,routh
2475,2476,do not worry about that,just take it moment moment moment moment,routh
2477,2478,the job is to be in that moment with no concern about the rest and no idea where you are going next,because if you can make one moment work you can go anywhere,routh
2479,2480,now it sounds i know like the simplest notion and that is why it is hardit is so simple that it is the thing that everybody misses,i believe that vincent daniels is the perfect man for you right now,routh
2481,2482,i have complete faith in him for you in your predicament,here is his card,routh
2483,2484,i came up here to give you this,jerry handed him the business card and so he took it at the same time that he said ca not do it,routh
2485,2486,what will you do instead,what will you do about all the roles you are ripe to play,routh
2487,2488,it breaks my heart when i think of all those parts you were made for,if you accepted the role of james tyrone then you could work with vincent and find your way through it with him,routh
2489,2490,this is the work he does with actors every day,i ca not count the number of times at the tonys or the oscars that i heard the winning actor say i want to thank vincent daniels,routh
2491,2492,he is the best,in response axler simply shook his head,routh
2493,2494,look jerry said everyone knows the feeling i ca not do it everyone knows the feeling that they will be revealed to be falseit is every actor is terror,they have found me out,routh
2495,2496,i have been found out,let is face it there is a panic that comes with age,routh
2497,2498,i am that much older than you and i have been dealing with it for years,one you get slower,routh
2499,2500,in everything,even in reading you get slower,routh
2501,2502,if i go fast in reading now too much of it goes away,my speech is slower my memory is slower,routh
2503,2504,all these things start to happen,in the process you start to distrust yourself,routh
2505,2506,you are not as quick as you used to be,and especially if you are an actor,routh
2507,2508,you were a young actor and you memorized scripts one after the other after the other and you never even thought about it,it was just easy to do,routh
2509,2510,and then all of a sudden it is not as easy and things do not happen so fast anymore,memorizing becomes a big anxiety for stage actors going into their sixties and seventies,routh
2511,2512,once you could memorize a script in a daynow you are lucky to memorize a page in a day,so you start to feel afraid to feel soft to feel that you do not have that raw live power anymore,routh
2513,2514,it scares you,with the result as you say that you are not free anymore,routh
2515,2516,there is nothing happeningand that is terrifying,jerry i ca not go on with this conversation,routh
2517,2518,we could talk all day and to no avail,you are good to come and see me and bring me lunch and flowers and to try to help me and encourage me and comfort me and make me feel better,routh
2519,2520,it was tremendously thoughtful,i am pleased to see you looking well,routh
2521,2522,but the momentum of a life is the momentum of a life,i am now incapable of acting,routh
2523,2524,something fundamental has vanished,maybe it had to,routh
2525,2526,things go,do not think that my career is been cut short,routh
2527,2528,think of how long i lasted,when i started out in college i was just fooling around you know,routh
2529,2530,acting was a chance to meet girls,then i took my first theatrical breath,routh
2531,2532,suddenly i was alive on the stage and breathing like an actor,i started young,routh
2533,2534,i was twentytwo and came to new york for an audition,and i got the part,routh
2535,2536,i began to take classes,sensememory exercises,routh
2537,2538,practice making things real,before your performance create a reality for yourself to step into,routh
2539,2540,i remember that when i began taking class we had have a pretend teacup and pretend to drink from it,how hot is it how full is it is there a saucer is there a spoon are you going to put sugar in it how many lumps,routh
2541,2542,and then you sip it and others were transported by this stuff but i never found any of it helpful,what is more i could not do it,routh
2543,2544,i was no good at the exercises no good at all,i had try to do this stuff and it never would work,routh
2545,2546,everything i did well was coming out of instinct and doing those exercises and knowing those things were making me look like an actor,i would look ridiculous as i held my pretend teacup and pretended to drink from it,routh
2547,2548,there was always a sly voice inside me saying there is no teacup,well that sly voice has now taken over,routh
2549,2550,no matter how i prepare and what i attempt to do once i am on the stage there is that sly voice all the timethere is no teacup,jerry it is over i can no longer make a play real for people,routh
2551,2552,i can no longer make a role real for myself,after jerry had left axler went into his study and found his copy of long day is journey into night,routh
2553,2554,he tried to read it but the effort was unbearable,he did not get beyond page 4he put vincent daniels is card there as a bookmark,routh
2555,2556,at the kennedy center it was as though he had never acted before and now it was as though he had never read a play beforeas though he had never read this play before,the sentences unfolded without meaning,routh
2557,2558,he could not keep straight who was speaking the lines,sitting there amid his books he tried to remember plays in which there is a character who commits suicide,routh
2559,2560,hedda in hedda gabler julie in miss julie phaedra in hippolytus jocasta in oedipus the king almost everyone in antigone willy loman in death of a salesman joe keller in all my sons don parritt in the iceman cometh simon stimson in our town ophelia in hamlet othello in othello cassius and brutus in julius caesar goneril in king lear antony cleopatra enobarbus and charmian in antony and cleopatra the grandfather in awake and sing,ivanov in ivanov konstantin in the seagull,routh
2561,2562,and this astonishing list was only of plays in which he had at one time performed,there were more many more,routh
2563,2564,what was remarkable was the frequency with which suicide enters into drama as though it were a formula fundamental to the drama not necessarily supported by the action as dictated by the workings of the genre itself,deirdre in deirdre of the sorrows hedvig in the wild duck rebecca west in rosmersholm christine and orin in mourning becomes electra both romeo and juliet sophocles ajax,routh
2565,2566,suicide is a subject dramatists have been contemplating with awe since the fifth century b,c,routh
2567,2568,beguiled by the human beings who are capable of generating emotions that can inspire this most extraordinary act,he should set himself the task of rereading these plays,routh
2569,2570,yes everything gruesome must be squarely faced,nobody should be able to say that he did not think it through,routh
2571,2572,jerry had brought a manila envelope containing a handful of mail addressed to him in care of the oppenheim agency,there was a time when a dozen letters from fans would come to him that way every couple of weeks,routh
2573,2574,now these few were all that had arrived at jerry is during the past half year,he sat in the living room idly tearing the envelopes open reading each letter is first few lines and then balling the page up and throwing it onto the floor,routh
2575,2576,they were all requests for autographed photosall but one which took him by surprise and which he read in its entirety,i do not know if you will remember me the letter began,routh
2577,2578,i was a patient at hammerton,i had dinner with you several times,routh
2579,2580,we were in art therapy together,maybe you wo not remember me,routh
2581,2582,i have just finished watching a latenight movie on tv and to my amazement you were in it,you were playing a hardened criminal,routh
2583,2584,it was so startling to see you on the screen especially in such a menacing role,how different from the man i met,routh
2585,2586,i remember telling you my story,i remember how you listened to me meal after meal,routh
2587,2588,i could not stop talking,i was in agony,routh
2589,2590,i thought my life was over,i wanted it to be over,routh
2591,2592,you may not know it but your listening to my story the way you did contributed to my getting through back then,not that it is been easy,routh
2593,2594,not that it is now,not that it ever will be,routh
2595,2596,the monster i was married to has done ineradicable damage to my family,the disaster was worse than i knew when i was hospitalized,routh
2597,2598,terrible things had been going on for a long time without my knowing anything about them,tragic things involving my little girl,routh
2599,2600,i remember asking you if you would kill him for me,i told you i would pay,routh
2601,2602,i thought because you were so big you could do it,mercifully you did not tell me that i was crazy when i said that but sat there listening to my madness as though i were sane,routh
2603,2604,i thank you for that,but a part of me will never be sane again,routh
2605,2606,it ca not be,it could not be,routh
2607,2608,it should not be,stupidly i sentenced the wrong person to death,routh
2609,2610,the letter went on a single handwritten paragraph stretching loosely over three more big sheets of paper and it was signed sybil van buren,he remembered listening to her storysummoning up his concentration and listening like that to someone other than himself was as close as he had come to acting in a long time and may even have helped him to recover,routh
2611,2612,yes he remembered her and her story and her asking him to kill her husband as though he were a gangster in a movie rather than another patient in a psychiatric hospital who big as he was was as incapable as she of violently ending his own suffering with a gun,people go around killing people in movies all the time but the reason they make all those movies is that for 99,routh
2613,2614,9 percent of the audience it is impossible to do,and if it is that hard to kill someone else someone you have every reason to want to destroy imagine how hard it is to succeed in killing yourself,routh
2615,2616,he had known pegeens parents as good friends before pegeen was born and had seen her first in the hospital as a tiny infant nursing at her mother is breast,they had met when axler and the newly married staplefordshe from michigan she from kansasappeared together in a greenwich village church basement production of playboy of the western world,routh
2617,2618,axler had played the wonderfully wild lead role of christy mahon the wouldbe parricide while the female lead pegeen mike flaherty the strongminded barmaid in her father is pub on the west coast of county mayo had been played by carol stapleford then two months pregnant with a first child asa stapleford had played shawn keogh pegeen is betrothed,when the play is run ended axler had been at the closingnight party to cast his vote for christy as the name for a son and pegeen mike as the name for a daughter when the staplefords baby arrived,routh
2619,2620,it was not likelyparticularly as pegeen mike stapleford had lived as a lesbian since she was twentythreethat when she was forty years old and axler was sixtyfive they would become lovers who would speak on the phone every morning upon awakening and would eagerly spend their free time together at his house where to his delight she appropriated two rooms for her own one of the three bedrooms on the second floor for her things and the downstairs study off the living room for her laptop,there were fireplaces in all the downstairs rooms even one in the kitchen and when pegeen was working in the study she had a fire going all the time,routh
2621,2622,she lived a little over an hour away journeying along winding hilly roads that carried her across farm country to his fifty acres of open fields and the large old blackshuttered white farmhouse enclosed by ancient maples and big ashes and long uneven stone walls,there was nobody but the two of them anywhere nearby,routh
2623,2624,during the first few months they rarely got out of bed before noon,they could not leave each other alone,routh
2625,2626,yet before her arrival he had been sure he was finished finished with acting with women with people finished forever with happiness,he had been in serious physical distress for over a year barely able to walk any distance or to stand or sit for very long because of the spinal pain that he had put up with all his adult life but whose debilitating progress had accelerated with ageand so he was sure he was finished with everything,routh
2627,2628,one of his legs would intermittently go dead so that he could not raise it properly while walking and he would miss a step or a curb and fall opening cuts on his hands and even landing on his face bloodying his lip or his nose,only a few months earlier his best and only local friend an eightyyearold judge who had retired some years back had died of cancer as a result though axler had been based two hours from the city amid the trees and fields for thirty yearsliving there when he was not out somewhere in the world performinghe did not have anyone with whom to talk or to eat a meal let alone share a bed,routh
2629,2630,and he was thinking again about killing himself as often as he had been before being hospitalized a year earlier,every morning when he awoke to his emptiness he determined he could not go another day shorn of his skills alone workless and in persistent pain,routh
2631,2632,once again the focus was down to suicide at the center of the dispossession there was only that,on a frigid gray morning after a week of heavy snowstorms axler left the house for the carport to drive the four miles into town and stock up on groceries,routh
2633,2634,pathways around the house had been kept clear every day by a farmer who did his snowplowing for him but he walked carefully nonetheless wearing snow boots with thick treads and carrying a cane and taking tiny steps to prevent himself from slipping and falling,under his layers of clothes his midsection was enveloped for safety is sake in a stiff back brace,routh
2635,2636,as he started out of the house and headed for the carport he spotted a small longtailed whitish animal standing in the snow between the carport and the barn,it looked at first like a very large rat and then he realized from the shape and color of the furless tail and from the snout that it was a possum about ten inches long,routh
2637,2638,possums are ordinarily nocturnal but this one whose coat looked discolored and scruffy was down on the snowcovered ground in broad daylight,as axler approached the possum waddled feebly off in the direction of the barn and then disappeared into a mound of snow up against the barn is stone foundation,routh
2639,2640,he followed the animalwhich was probably sick and nearing its endand when he got to the mound of snow saw that there was an entry hole cleared at the front,supporting himself with both hands on his cane he kneeled down in the snow to peer inside,routh
2641,2642,the possum had retreated too far back into the hole to be seen but strewn about the front of the cavelike interior was a collection of sticks,he counted them,routh
2643,2644,six sticks,so that is how it is done axler thought,routh
2645,2646,i have got too much,all you need are six,routh
2647,2648,the following morning while he was making his coffee he saw the possum through the kitchen window,the animal was standing on its hind legs by the barn eating snow from a drift pushing gobs of it into its mouth with its front paws,routh
2649,2650,hurriedly he put on his boots and his coat picked up his cane went out the front door and came around to the cleared path by the side of the house facing the barn,from some twenty feet away he called across to the possum in full voice how would you like to play james tyrone,routh
2651,2652,at the guthrie,the possum just kept eating snow,routh
2653,2654,you had be a wonderful james tyrone,after that day nature is little caricature of him came to an end,routh
2655,2656,he never saw the possum againeither it disappeared or perishedthough the snow cave with the six sticks remained intact until the next thaw,then pegeen stopped by,routh
2657,2658,she phoned from the little house she had rented a few miles from prescott a small progressive women is college in western vermont where she had recently taken a teaching job,he lived an hour west across the state line in rural new york,routh
2659,2660,it was twenty years or more since he had seen her as a cheerful undergraduate traveling during her vacation with her mother and father,they had be in his vicinity and stop off for a couple of hours to say hello,routh
2661,2662,every few years they all got together like that,asa ran a regional theater in lansing michigan the town where he had been born and raised and carol acted in the repertory company and taught an acting class at the state university,routh
2663,2664,he had seen pegeen on another visit once before a smiling shy sweetfaced kid of ten who had climbed his trees and swum rapid laps in his pool a skinny athletic tomboy who laughed helplessly at all her father is jokes,and before that he had seen her suckling on the maternity floor of st,routh
2665,2666,vincent is hospital in new york,now he saw a lithe fullbreasted woman of forty though with something of the child still in her smilea smile in which she automatically raised her upper lip to reveal her prominent front teethand a lot of the tomboy still in her rocking gait,routh
2667,2668,she was dressed for the countryside in wellworn work boots and a red zippered jacket and her hair which he had incorrectly remembered as blond like her mother is was a deep brown and cut close to her skull so short at the back as to appear clipped by a barber is trimmer,she had the invulnerable air of a happy person and though her prototype was rough gamine she spoke in an appealingly modulated voice as if imitating her actress mother is diction,routh
2669,2670,as he would eventually learn it had been some time since she had had what she wanted rather than its grotesque inversion,she had spent the last two years of a sixyear affair suffering in a painfully lonely household in bozeman montana,routh
2671,2672,the first four years she told him one night after they had become lovers priscilla and i had this wonderfully cozy companionship,we used to go camping and hiking all the time even when it snowed,routh
2673,2674,in the summers we had go off to places like alaska and hike and camp up there,it was exciting,routh
2675,2676,we went to new zealand we went to malaysia,there was something childlike about us adventurously roaming around the world together that i loved,routh
2677,2678,we were like two runaways,then starting around year five she slowly drifted away into the computer and i was left with no one to talk to except the cats,routh
2679,2680,until then we had done everything side by side,we had be tucked up in bed readingreading to ourselves reading passages aloud to each other for such a long time there was the rapturous rapport,routh
2681,2682,priscilla would never tell people i liked that book but rather we liked that book or about some place we liked going there or about our plans that is what we are going to do this summer,we,routh
2683,2684,we,we,routh
2685,2686,and then we were not wewe was over,we was she and her mac,routh
2687,2688,we was she and her festering secret that blotted out everything elsethat she was going to mutilate the body i loved,the two of them taught at the university in bozeman and during their final two years as a couple when priscilla got home from work she sat in front of her computer until it was time for bed,routh
2689,2690,she spent her weekends in front of the computer,she ate and drank in front of the computer,routh
2691,2692,there was no more talk no more sex even hiking and camping in the mountains pegeen had to undertake on her own or with people other than priscilla whom she rounded up for companionship,then one day six years after they had met in montana and pooled their resources and set themselves up as a couple priscilla announced that she had begun taking hormonal injections to promote facial hair growth and deepen her voice,routh
2693,2694,her plan was to have her breasts surgically removed and become a man,alone priscilla admitted she had been dreaming this up for a long time and she would not turn back however much pegeen pleaded,routh
2695,2696,the very next morning pegeen moved out of the house they jointly owned taking with her one of the two catsnot so great for the cats said pegeen but that was the least of itand she settled into a room at a local motel,she could barely gather enough composure to meet with her classes,routh
2697,2698,lonely as it had become living with priscilla the wound of the betrayal the nature of the betrayal was far worse,she cried all the time and began to write letters to colleges hundreds of miles from montana looking for a new job,routh
2699,2700,she went to a conference where colleges were interviewing people in environmental science and found a position in the east after sleeping with the dean who became smitten by her and subsequently hired her,the dean was still pegeen is devoted protector and paramour when pegeen drove over to pay axler a visit and determined that after seventeen years as a lesbian she wanted a manthis man this actor twentyfive years her senior and her family is friend from decades back,routh
2701,2702,if priscilla could become a heterosexual male pegeen could become a heterosexual female,that first afternoon axler tripped and fell hard on the wide stone step as he led pegeen into the house gashing the meaty side of the hand with which he broke the fall,routh
2703,2704,where is your firstaid stuff,she asked,routh
2705,2706,he told her and she went inside to get it and came back out and cleaned his wound with cotton and peroxide and covered it with a couple of bandaids,she had also brought him a glass of water to drink,routh
2707,2708,nobody had brought him a glass of water for a long time,he invited her to stay for dinner,routh
2709,2710,she wound up making it,nobody had made him dinner for a long time either,routh
2711,2712,she finished off a bottle of beer while he sat at the kitchen table and watched her prepare the meal,there was a chunk of parmesan cheese in the refrigerator there were eggs there was some bacon there was half a container of cream and with that and a pound of pasta she made them spaghetti carbonara,routh
2713,2714,he was remembering the sight of her as an infant at her mother is breast while observing her as she worked in his kitchen behaving as though the place were hers,she was a vibrant presence solid fit brimming with energy and soon enough he was no longer feeling that he was alone on earth without his talent,routh
2715,2716,he was happyan unexpected feeling,usually at the dinner hour he had the worst blues of the day,routh
2717,2718,while she cooked he went into the living room and put on brendel playing schubert,he could not remember the last time he had bothered listening to music and back in the best days of his marriage it was playing all the time,routh
2719,2720,what happened to your wife,she asked after they had eaten the spaghetti and shared a bottle of wine,routh
2721,2722,does not matter,too tedious to discuss,routh
2723,2724,how long have you been out here without anyone else,long enough to be lonelier than i ever thought i could be,routh
2725,2726,it is sometimes astonishing sitting here month after month season after season to think that it is all going on without you,just as it will when you die,routh
2727,2728,what happened to acting,she asked,routh
2729,2730,i do not act anymore,that ca not be she said,routh
2731,2732,what happened,also too tedious to go into,routh
2733,2734,have you retired or did something happen,he stood up and came around the table and she stood and he kissed her,routh
2735,2736,she smiled with surprise,laughing she said i am a sexual anomaly,routh
2737,2738,i sleep with women,that was not hard to figure out,routh
2739,2740,here he kissed her a second time,so what are you doing,routh
2741,2742,she asked,he shrugged,routh
2743,2744,i ca not say that i know,you have never been with a man,routh
2745,2746,he asked her,when i was in college,routh
2747,2748,are you with a woman now,more or less she replied,routh
2749,2750,are you,no,routh
2751,2752,he felt the strength in her wellmuscled arms he fumbled with her heavy breasts he cupped her hard behind in his hands and drew her toward him so that they kissed again,then he led her to the sofa in the living room where blushing furiously as he watched her she undid her jeans and was with a man for the first time since college,routh
2753,2754,he was with a lesbian for the first time in his life,months later he had say to her how come you drove over that afternoon,routh
2755,2756,i wanted to see if anybody was with you,and when you saw,routh
2757,2758,i thought why not me,you calculate like that all the time,routh
2759,2760,it is not calculation,it is pursuing what you want,routh
2761,2762,and she added not pursuing what you no longer want,the dean who had hired her and brought her to prescott was furious when pegeen told her their affair was over,routh
2763,2764,she was eight years older than pegeen earned more than twice as much as pegeen had been an important dean for over a decade and so she refused to believe it or to allow it,she phoned pegeen to scold her first thing every morning and called her numerous times during the night to shout at her and insult her and demand an explanation,routh
2765,2766,once she phoned from a local cemetery where she announced she was stomping around in a fury because of the way pegeen had treated her,she accused pegeen of exploiting her to get the job and then opportunistically dropping her within only weeks of taking it,routh
2767,2768,when pegeen went to the pool to work out with the swim team twice a week in the late afternoon the dean turned up to swim at that hour and arranged to take the locker next to pegeen is,the dean called to invite her to a movie to a lecture to a concert and dinner,routh
2769,2770,she called every other day to tell pegeen that she wanted to see her that coming weekend,pegeen had already made it clear that she was busy on weekends and did not want to resume seeing her again,routh
2771,2772,the dean pleaded she shoutedsometimes she cried,pegeen was the person she could not live without,routh
2773,2774,a strong successful competent woman of fortyeight a dynamic woman touted to be prescott is next president and how easily she could be derailed,one sunday afternoon she called his house and asked to speak to pegeen stapleford,routh
2775,2776,axler put down the phone and went into the living room to tell pegeen the call was for her,who is it,routh
2777,2778,he asked her,without hesitation she replied who else could it be,routh
2779,2780,louise,how does she know where i am,routh
2781,2782,how did she get your number,he returned to the phone and said there is no pegeen stapleford here,routh
2783,2784,thank you the caller said and hung up,the next week pegeen ran into louise on the campus,routh
2785,2786,louise told her that she was going away for ten days and that when she came back pegeen had better do something for her like make her dinner,afterward pegeen was frightened first because louise would not leave her alone even after she once again clarified that the affair was over and second because of the threat louise is anger embodied,routh
2787,2788,what is threatened,he asked,routh
2789,2790,what,my job,routh
2791,2792,there is no limit to the harm she can do me if she sets her mind to it,well you have me do not you,routh
2793,2794,he said,what does that mean,routh
2795,2796,you have me to fall back on,i am right here,routh
2797,2798,he was here,she was here,routh
2799,2800,everyone is possibilities had changed dramatically,the first article of clothing he bought her was a tan closefitting waistlength leather jacket with a shearling lining that he saw in the window of a shop in the upscale village that lay ten miles through the woods from his house,routh
2801,2802,he went in and purchased what he guessed correctly to be her size,the jacket cost a thousand dollars,routh
2803,2804,she had never owned anything that expensive before and she had never looked so good in anything before,he told her it was for her birthday whenever that fell,routh
2805,2806,for the next few days she did not take it off her back,then they drove to new york ostensibly to have some good meals and go to the movies and get away for the weekend together and he bought her more clothesby the time the weekend was over more than five thousand dollars worth of skirts blouses belts jackets shoes and sweaters outfits in which she looked very different from the way she looked in the clothes she had brought east with her from montana,routh
2807,2808,when she had first showed up at his house she owned little that could not be worn by a sixteenyearold boyonly now had she begun to give up walking like a sixteenyearold boy,in the new york stores after trying on something new in the dressing room she had come out to where he was waiting for her to show him how it looked and to hear what he thought,routh
2809,2810,she was paralyzingly selfconscious for only the first few hours after that she let it happen eventually emerging coquettishly from the dressing room smiling with delight,he bought her necklaces bracelets and earrings,routh
2811,2812,he bought her luxurious lingerie to replace the sport bras and the gray briefs,he bought her little satin babydolls to replace her flannel pajamas,routh
2813,2814,he bought her calfhigh boots a brown pair and a black pair,the only coat she owned she had inherited from priscilla is late mother,routh
2815,2816,it was way too large for her and shaped like a box and so over the next few months he bought her flattering new coatsfive of them,he could have bought her a hundred,routh
2817,2818,he could not stop,living as he did he rarely spent anything on himself and nothing made him happier than making her look like she had never looked before,routh
2819,2820,and in time nothing seemed to make her happier,it was an orgy of spoiling and spending that suited them both just fine,routh
2821,2822,still she did not want her parents to learn about the affair,it would cause them too much pain,routh
2823,2824,he thought more pain than when you told them you were a lesbian,she had explained to him what had happened on that day back when she was twentythree,routh
2825,2826,her mother had cried and said i ca not imagine anything worse and her father feigned acceptance but did not smile again for months,there was a lot of trauma in that home for a long time after pegeen told them what she was,routh
2827,2828,why would learning about me cause them so much pain,he asked her,routh
2829,2830,because they have known you so long,because you are all the same age,routh
2831,2832,as you wish he said,but he could not stop pondering her motive,routh
2833,2834,perhaps she was acting out of the habit of keeping her life in different compartments the sexual life strictly separated from her life as a daughter maybe she did not want the sex contaminated or domesticated by filial concerns,maybe there was some embarrassment about her turning from sleeping with women to sleeping with a man and an uncertainty as to whether the switch was going to be permanent,routh
2835,2836,but regardless of what was prompting her he felt he had made a mistake in allowing her to keep their connection a secret from her family,he was too old not to feel compromised by having to be kept a secret,routh
2837,2838,nor did he see why a fortyyearold woman should be so concerned about what her parents thought especially a fortyyearold woman who had done all sorts of things that her parents disapproved of and whose opposition she weathered,he did not like that she was showing herself to be less than her age but he did not push it not for now and so her family continued to think she was going along leading her regular life while with the passing months she seemed to him slowly but naturally to shed the last visible signs of what she now referred to as my seventeenyear mistake,routh
2839,2840,nonetheless one morning at breakfast as much to his own surprise as hers axler said is this something you really want pegeen,though we have enjoyed each other so far and the novelty has been strong and the feeling has been strong and the pleasure has been strong i wonder if you know what you are doing,routh
2841,2842,yes i do,i love this she said and i do not want it to stop,routh
2843,2844,but you understand what i am referring to,yes,routh
2845,2846,matters of age,matters of sexual history,routh
2847,2848,your old connection to my parents,probably twenty things besides,routh
2849,2850,and none of them bother me,do any of them bother you,routh
2851,2852,would it perhaps be a good idea he replied before hearts get broken for us to back off,are not you happy,routh
2853,2854,she asked,my life has been very precarious over the past few years,routh
2855,2856,i do not feel the strength that it would take having my hopes dashed,i have had my share of marital misery and before that my share of breakups with women,routh
2857,2858,it is always painful it is always harsh and i do not want to court it at this stage of life,simon we both have been dropped she said,routh
2859,2860,you were at the bottom of a breakdown and your wife picked up and left you to fend for yourself,i was betrayed by priscilla,routh
2861,2862,not only did she leave me she left the body that i had once loved to become a man with a mustache named jack,if we do fail let it be because of us not because of them not because of your past or mine,routh
2863,2864,i do not want to encourage you in a risk and i know it is a risk,for both of us by the way,routh
2865,2866,i feel the risk too,it is of a different sort than yours of course,routh
2867,2868,but the worst outcome possible is for you to take yourself away from me,i could not bear to lose you now,routh
2869,2870,i will if i have to but as for the riskthe risk has been taken,we have already done it,routh
2871,2872,it is too late for protection by withdrawing,you are saying you do not want to get out of this thing while the getting is good,routh
2873,2874,absolutely,i want you you see,routh
2875,2876,i have come to trust that i have you,do not pull away from me,routh
2877,2878,i love this and i do not want it to stop,there is nothing else i can say,routh
2879,2880,all i can say is that i will try if you will,this is no longer just a fling,routh
2881,2882,we took the risk he said echoing her,we took the risk she replied,routh
2883,2884,four words meaning that it would be the worst possible time for her to be dropped by him,she will say whatever she needs to say he thought even if the dialogue verges on soap opera to keep it going because she is still aching all these months later from the priscilla shock and the louise ultimatums,routh
2885,2886,it is not deception her taking this lineit is the way we are instinctively strategic,but eventually a day will come axler thought when circumstances render her in a much stronger position for it to end whereas i will have wound up in a weaker position merely from having been too indecisive to cut it off now,routh
2887,2888,and when she is strong and i am weak the blow that is dealt will be unbearable,he believed he was seeing clearly into their future yet he could do nothing to alter the prospect,routh
2889,2890,he was too happy to alter it,over the months she had let her hair grow nearly to her shoulders thick brown hair with a natural sheen that she began to think about having cut in a style unlike the cropped mannish one she had favored throughout her adult life,routh
2891,2892,one weekend she arrived with a couple of magazines full of photos of different hairstyles magazines of a kind he had never seen before,where had you get these,routh
2893,2894,he asked her,one of my students she said,routh
2895,2896,they sat side by side on the sofa in the living room while she turned pages and bent back corners where there was a style pictured that might suit her,finally they narrowed their preferences down to two and she tore out those pages and he phoned an actress friend in manhattan to ask her where pegeen should go to get her hair cut the same friend who had told him where to take pegeen shopping for clothes and where to go to buy her jewelry,routh
2897,2898,wish i had a sugar daddy the friend said,but he had not understood it that way,routh
2899,2900,all he was doing was helping pegeen to be a woman he would want instead of a woman another woman would want,together they were absorbed in making this happen,routh
2901,2902,he went with her to an expensive hairdresser is in the east sixties,a young japanese woman cut pegeen is hair after looking at the two photos they had brought,routh
2903,2904,he had never seen pegeen look as disarmed as she did sitting in the chair in front of the mirror after her hair had been washed,he had never before seen her look so weakened or so at a loss as to how to behave,routh
2905,2906,the sight of her silent sheepish sitting there at the edge of humiliation unable even to look at her reflection gave the haircut an entirely transformed meaning igniting all his selfmistrust and causing him to wonder as he had more than once if he was not being blinded by a stupendous and desperate illusion,what is the draw of a woman like this to a man who is losing so much,routh
2907,2908,was not he making her pretend to be someone other than who she was,was not he dressing her up in costume as though a costly skirt could dispose of nearly two decades of lived experience,routh
2909,2910,was not he distorting her while telling himself a lieand a lie that in the end might be anything but harmless,what if he proved to be no more than a brief male intrusion into a lesbian life,routh
2911,2912,but then pegeen is thick brown shiny hair was cutcut to below the base of her neck in a choppy way so none of the layers were even a look that gave her precisely the right caredfor devilmaycare air of slight dishevelmentand she seemed so transformed that all these unanswered questions ceased to trouble him they did not even require serious thought,it took her a little longer than it took him to be convinced that the two of them had chosen correctly but in only a few days the haircut and all it signified about her allowing him to shape her to determine what she should look like and advance an idea of what her true life was appeared to have become more than just acceptable,routh
2913,2914,perhaps because she looked so great in his eyes she did not bridle at continuing to submit to his ministrations alien though that might have been to a lifelong sense of herself,if indeed hers was the will that was submittingif indeed it was not she who had taken him over completely taken him up and taken him over,routh
2915,2916,late one friday afternoon pegeen arrived at his house in distressout in lansing her family had received a midnight phone call from louise to tell them how she had been opportunistically exploited and deceived by their daughter,what else,routh
2917,2918,he said,his question brought pegeen close to tears,routh
2919,2920,she told them about you,she said i was living with you,routh
2921,2922,and what did they say to that,my mother was the one who answered,routh
2923,2924,he was asleep,and how did she take it,routh
2925,2926,she asked me if it was true,i told her i was not living with you,routh
2927,2928,i told her we had become close friends,what did your father say,routh
2929,2930,he never came to the phone,why did not he,routh
2931,2932,i do not know,that miserable bitch,routh
2933,2934,why wo not she stop,she cried,routh
2935,2936,that obsessive possessive jealous rancorous bitch,does it really matter to you that she told your parents,routh
2937,2938,does not it matter to you,pegeen asked him,routh
2939,2940,only inasmuch as it troubles you,otherwise not at all,routh
2941,2942,i think it is all to the good,what do i say when i talk to my father,routh
2943,2944,she asked,pegeen mikesay whatever you like,routh
2945,2946,suppose he decides not to talk to me at all,i doubt that will happen,routh
2947,2948,suppose he wants to talk to you,then he and i will talk axler said,routh
2949,2950,how angry is he,your father is a reasonable and sensible man,routh
2951,2952,why would he be angry,oh that bitchshe is completely whacked,routh
2953,2954,she is out of control,yes he said the thought of you tortures her,routh
2955,2956,but you are not out of control i am not and neither are your mother and father,then why did not my father speak to me,routh
2957,2958,if you are so worried call and ask him,perhaps you had like me to speak to him,routh
2959,2960,no i will do iti will do it myself,she waited until after they had eaten before phoning lansing and then doing it from her study behind the closed door,routh
2961,2962,after fifteen minutes she came out carrying the phone and pointed with it toward him,axler took the phone,routh
2963,2964,asa,hello,routh
2965,2966,hi there,i hear you seduced my daughter,routh
2967,2968,i am having an affair with her that is true,well i ca not say i am not a little astonished,routh
2969,2970,well axler replied with a laugh i ca not say that i am not either,when she told me she was going to visit you i really never figured that this was in the cards asa said,routh
2971,2972,well i am glad you are all right with it axler replied,there was a pause before asa answered pegeen is a free agent,routh
2973,2974,she left her childhood long ago,look carol wants to say hello asa said and then passed the phone to his wife,routh
2975,2976,well well carol said who ever could have imagined this when we were all kiddies in new york,no one axler replied,routh
2977,2978,i could not have imagined it the day she showed up here,is my daughter doing the right thing,routh
2979,2980,carol asked him,i think so,routh
2981,2982,what is your plan,carol asked,routh
2983,2984,i have no plan,pegeen has always surprised us,routh
2985,2986,she surprised me too axler said,i think she is no less surprised,routh
2987,2988,well she surprised her friend louise,he did not bother to reply that louise was something of a surprise herself,routh
2989,2990,carol is intention clearly was to be mild and friendly but he was sure from the brittleness of her tone that the call was an ordeal and that she and asa were simply doing the right thing which was their way doing the sensible thing that would make pegeen happiest,they did not want to alienate her at forty as they had at twentythree when she had told them she was a lesbian,routh
2991,2992,in fact carol flew in from michigan the following saturday to meet pegeen in new york for lunch,pegeen drove down to the city that morning and got back about eight that night,routh
2993,2994,he had made dinner for them and only when dinner was over did he ask her how it had gone,well what did she say,routh
2995,2996,axler asked,do you want me to be entirely honest,routh
2997,2998,pegeen replied,please he said,routh
2999,3000,all right she said i will try to remember as exactly as i can,it was kind of the benign third degree,routh
3001,3002,there was nothing vulgar or selfserving about her,just mother is flatout kansas candor,routh
3003,3004,go ahead,you want to know everything pegeen said,routh
3005,3006,yes he replied,well first off at the restaurant she breezed right by my tableshe failed to recognize me,routh
3007,3008,i said mother and then she turned back and she said oh my goodness it is my daughter,do not you look pretty,routh
3009,3010,and i said pretty,did not you think i was pretty before,routh
3011,3012,and she said a new hairdo clothes of a kind i never saw you wear before,and i said more feminine you mean,routh
3013,3014,hadecidedly she said yes,it is very flattering dear,routh
3015,3016,how long has this been going on,i told her and she said that is a very nice haircut,routh
3017,3018,it could not have been inexpensive,and i said to her i am just trying something new,routh
3019,3020,and she said i guess you are trying something new in many ways,i came out because i want to be sure that you have thought through all the implications of your affair,routh
3021,3022,i told her that i was not sure anyone ever thinks through being with someone romantically,i told her that it made me very happy right now,routh
3023,3024,and so she said news reached us that he was in a psychiatric hospital,some people say he was there six months some say a yeari do not really know the facts,routh
3025,3026,i told her that you were there for twentysix days a full twelve months ago and that it had to do with performance problems on the stage,i said that you temporarily lost your power to act and separated from your acting you came apart,routh
3027,3028,i said that whatever emotional or mental problems you had then they did not manifest themselves in our life together now,i said you were as sane or saner than anyone i have ever been with and that when we are together you seem stable and quite happy,routh
3029,3030,and she asked is he still in the same bind with his acting,and i said yes and noyou were but i thought that as a result of meeting me and being with me it was no longer the same tragedy it had been,routh
3031,3032,it was now more like an athlete who is been injured and sidelined and is waiting to heal,and she said you do not feel you have to rescue him do you,routh
3033,3034,i assured her that i did not and she asked how you filled your time and i said he sees me,i think he plans to continue seeing me,routh
3035,3036,he reads,he buys me clothes,routh
3037,3038,well she leaped on thatso these are clothes he bought for you,well i would think there might be a certain rescue fantasy working there,routh
3039,3040,i told her that she was making too much of it and that it was just fun for both of us and why could not we leave it at that,i said he is not trying to influence me in any way i do not want to be influenced,routh
3041,3042,she asked  hado you go with him when he buys you clothes,and i said usually,routh
3043,3044,but again i think it makes him happy,and i can see that in him,routh
3045,3046,since it happens to be an experiment i want to conduct as well i told her i do not see why anyone should be concerned,and that is when the tenor of the conversation changed,routh
3047,3048,she said well i have to tell you that i am concerned,you are new to the world of men and it strikes me as strangeor maybe not so strangethat the man you should choose to initiate this new life with is a man twentyfive years older than you are who has been through a breakdown that led to his being institutionalized,routh
3049,3050,and who now is essentially unemployed,all those things do not bode well to me,routh
3051,3052,i told her that it did not seem any worse than the situation i was in before with someone whom i once loved very much and who told me one morning i ca not go on in this body and decided she wanted to be a man,and then i made my speech the speech i had prepared and recited aloud driving down,routh
3053,3054,i said as for his age mother i do not see it as a problem,if i am going to try to be attractive to men and also learn whether i am attracted to men this seems to be the best measure of it,routh
3055,3056,this person is the test,the twentyfive years register with me as twentyfive years more experience than someone would have if i were trying this with a man my own age,routh
3057,3058,we are not talking about getting married,i told youwe are just enjoying each other,routh
3059,3060,i am enjoying him in part because he is twentyfive years older,and she said and he is enjoying you because you are twentyfive years younger,routh
3061,3062,i said  hado not be offended mother but are you at all jealous,and she laughed and said  hadear i am sixtythree and happily married to your father for over forty years,routh
3063,3064,it is true she said and you may get a kick out of knowing this but when i played pegeen mike and simon played christy in the synge play i had a crush on him,who did not,routh
3065,3066,he was wildly attractive energetic exuberant playful he was a big forceful actor a wonderful actor already his talent obviously a huge cut above everyone else is,so yes i had a crush but i was already married and pregnant with you,routh
3067,3068,the crush was something i passed through,i think i have seen him no more than ten times in the intervening years,routh
3069,3070,i respect him enormously as an actor,but i continue to be concerned by that hospital stay,routh
3071,3072,it is no small thing for someone to commit himself to a psychiatric hospital and to be there for however long or short a period it was,look she said for me the important thing is that you are not going into this blind,routh
3073,3074,you do not want to be doing something that for lack of experience a twentyyearold might do,i do not want you to act out of innocence,routh
3075,3076,and i said i am hardly innocent mother,i asked her what she was afraid might happen that could not happen with anyone,routh
3077,3078,and she said what am i afraid of,i am afraid of the fact that he is growing older by the day,routh
3079,3080,that is the way it works,you are sixtyfive and then you are sixtysix and then you are sixtyseven and so on,routh
3081,3082,in a few years he will be seventy,you will be with a seventyyearold man,routh
3083,3084,and it wo not stop there she told me,after that he will become a seventyfiveyearold man,routh
3085,3086,it never stops,it goes on,routh
3087,3088,he will begin to have health problems such as the elderly have and maybe things even worse and you are going to be the person responsible for his care,are you in love with him,routh
3089,3090,she said,i said i thought that i was,routh
3091,3092,and she asked is he in love with you,and i said i thought that you were,routh
3093,3094,i said i think it will be fine mother,it has occurred to me that he has to worry more than i do,routh
3095,3096,that this is a more precarious situation for him than it is for me,she asked how so,routh
3097,3098,i said well as you say i am trying this for the first time,although it is a novelty for him as well it is not nearly as much of one as it is for me,routh
3099,3100,i have been very surprised by how much i have enjoyed it,but i could not yet declare that it is definitely the permutation i will always want,routh
3101,3102,and she said well all right i do not want to go on and on and give this an urgency it does not have and may never have,i just thought it was important for me to see you and i must say once again i am very impressed by your appearance,routh
3103,3104,and i asked her  hadoes it make you think you would still have preferred a daughter who was straight,she said it makes me think that you would prefer not to be a lesbian any longer,routh
3105,3106,you can of course do whatever you like,in your independent youth you educated us about that,routh
3107,3108,but i ca not fail to notice the physical change,you have taken great care that everybody should notice that,routh
3109,3110,you even do your eyes,it is an impressive transformation,routh
3111,3112,that is when i said what do you think dad would think,and she said he could not be here because a new play opens in a few days and he ca not leave it,routh
3113,3114,but he wanted to come to see you and as soon as the play is on he will come if that is all right with you,and then you can ask him directly what he thinks,routh
3115,3116,so there we are,want to go shopping,routh
3117,3118,she said to me,i am admiring your shoes,routh
3119,3120,where had you get them,i told her and she said would you object if i bought a pair like that,routh
3121,3122,want to go with me to get them,and so we took a taxi to madison avenue and she bought a pair of twotoned pinkandbeige patent leather pumps with a pointy toe and a kitten heel in her size,routh
3123,3124,now she is walking around michigan in my prada shoes,she also admired my skirt so we went shopping for a skirt for her cut like mine down in soho,routh
3125,3126,good ending is not it,but late in the afternoon you know what she said before leaving for the airport with her bags from the shopping,routh
3127,3128,this and not the shoes is the true ending,she said what you were trying to do with me at lunch pegeen was make it sound like the sanest and most reasonable arrangement on the planet when of course it is not,routh
3129,3130,but people on the outside are only going to frustrate you if they try to talk you out of what you wake up every day wanting and what is buoying you above everybody is humdrum sameness,i have to tell you that when i first learned of this i thought it was wacky and ill advised,routh
3131,3132,and now that i have spoken with you and spent the day with you and been shopping with you for the first time really since you went off to college now that i have seen that you are completely calm rational and thoughtful about it i still think it is wacky and ill advised,here pegeen stopped,routh
3133,3134,it had taken her close to half an hour to repeat the conversation to him and in that time he had not spoken or moved from his chair nor had he told her to stop on any of those several occasions when he thought he had heard enough,but it was not in his interest to tell her to stopit was in his interest to find out everything to hear everything even if he had to to hear her say i could not yet declare that it is definitely the permutation i will always want,routh
3135,3136,that is it,that is all pegeen said,routh
3137,3138,that is pretty close to what was said,was it better or worse than you expected,routh
3139,3140,he asked,much better,routh
3141,3142,i was very anxious driving down there,well it sounds as though you had no need to be,routh
3143,3144,you handled yourself very well,then i was very anxious coming back about telling you all this and knowing that if i was truthful you were not going to like everything you heard,routh
3145,3146,well there was no need for that either,really,routh
3147,3148,i hope my telling you everything has not turned you against my mother,your mother said what a mother would say,routh
3149,3150,i understand,he laughed and said i ca not say that i disagree with her,routh
3151,3152,softly and flushing as she spoke pegeen said i hope it has not turned you against me,it is made me admire you he said,routh
3153,3154,you did not flinch from anything either in talking with her or now in talking with me,truly,routh
3155,3156,you are not hurt,no,routh
3157,3158,but of course he washurt and angry,he had sat there listening quietlyintently listening as he had been listening all his life offstage and onbut he was particularly stung by carol is clarification of the aging process and the jeopardy in which it placed her daughter,routh
3159,3160,nor however softly he now spoke was he unperturbed by wacky and ill advised,the whole thing disgusted him really,routh
3161,3162,it might be all right if pegeen were twentytwo and there were forty years difference between them but why this peculiar proprietary relationship with an adventurous fortyyearold,and what the hell did a woman of forty care what her parents wanted,routh
3163,3164,a part of them he thought should be happy that she was with him if only from a venal point of view,here is this eminent man with a lot of money who is going to take care of her,routh
3165,3166,after all she is not getting any younger herself,she settles down with someone who is achieved something in lifewhat is so wrong with that,routh
3167,3168,instead the message is do not set yourself up to be caretaker of a crazy old guy,however since pegeen had seemingly rejected carol is account of him he thought it best to stay silent about that as well as everything else that he did not like,routh
3169,3170,what would be the good of attacking her mother for butting in,better to appear to laugh it off,routh
3171,3172,if she should come to see him through her mother is eyes there was nothing he could say or do to stop her anyway,you are wonderful to me pegeen said to him,routh
3173,3174,you are what the doctor ordered,and you to me he said and he left it at that,routh
3175,3176,he did not go on from there to add as for your parents i had just as soon spare them but i ca not arrange my life according to their feelings,their feelings do not matter that much to me frankly and at this stage of the game they really should not matter that much to you either,routh
3177,3178,no he would not take off in that direction,instead he would sit tight and be patient and hope the family would fade away,routh
3179,3180,the next day pegeen devoted to stripping the wallpaper in her study,the wallpaper had been chosen by victoria many years before and though axler did not care about it one way or another pegeen could not stand the look of it and asked if she could take it down,routh
3181,3182,he told her the room was hers to do with as she liked as was the upstairs back bedroom and the bathroom beside it as indeed was every room in the house,he told her he could easily get a painter in to do the job but she insisted on stripping the walls and painting them herself thereby making the study officially hers,routh
3183,3184,she had all the necessary tools for stripping wallpaper at her house and she had brought them with her to begin the job that sunday the very day after her mother down in new york had questioned the wisdom of her being there at all,he must have gone in to watch her removing the wallpaper ten times during the course of the day and each time came away with the same reassuring thought she would not be working away like that if carol had succeeded in persuading her to leave him,routh
3185,3186,she would not be doing what she was doing if she were not planning to stay,that evening pegeen drove back to the college where she had a class to teach early the following morning,routh
3187,3188,when the phone rang around ten on sunday night he thought it was she who was calling to say that she was safely home,it was not,routh
3189,3190,it was the jilted dean,be forewarned mr,routh
3191,3192,famous she is desirable she is audacious and she is utterly ruthless utterly coldhearted incomparably selfish and completely amoral,and with that the dean hung up,routh
3193,3194,the next morning axler dropped off his car to be serviced and the mechanic gave him a ride back home in his tow truck,he would return the car to axler at the end of the day when the job was done,routh
3195,3196,around noon when axler went into the kitchen to make a sandwich for himself he happened to look out the window and saw something dart across the field adjacent to the barn and then disappear behind it,it was a person this time not a possum,routh
3197,3198,he stood back from the kitchen window and waited to see if perhaps there was a second third or fourth person lurking anywhere else,there had been a worrisome series of breakins throughout the county in recent months mainly into unoccupied houses owned by weekenders and he wondered if the absence of a car in his carport had caught the attention of the robbers and made him a target for a daytime theft,routh
3199,3200,quickly he headed for the attic to get his shotgun and load it with shells,then he went back downstairs to survey his property from the kitchen window,routh
3201,3202,a hundred yards to the north on the road that ran perpendicular to his he could see a parked car but it was too far for him to make out whether there was anyone inside it,it was unusual to see a car parked there at any time of the day or nightthere was a thickly wooded hill on the far side of the road and on his side open fields leading up to his barn carport and house,routh
3203,3204,suddenly the person hiding back of the barn came sneaking along the side of the barn and made a rush for the front of the house,from the kitchen he saw that the intruder was a tall thin redheaded woman dressed in jeans and a navy blue ski jacket,routh
3205,3206,she was peering into the living room through a front window,as he was still uncertain whether or not she was alone for the moment he froze the gun in his hands,routh
3207,3208,soon she began to move from one window to the next stopping each time to get a good look at the room inside,he slipped out of the house through the back door and without her seeing him came to within ten feet of where she was staring into one of the living room windows on the south side of the house,routh
3209,3210,aiming the rifle at her he spoke,what can i do for you lady,routh
3211,3212,oh,she cried when she turned and saw him,routh
3213,3214,oh i am sorry,are you alone,routh
3215,3216,yes,i am alone,routh
3217,3218,i am louise renner,you are the dean,routh
3219,3220,yes,she did not look much older than pegeen but she was a good deal taller only inches shorter than he was and what with her erect carriage and the red hair pulled away from her high forehead and knotted severely at the back of her neck there was a heroically statuesque aura to this woman,routh
3221,3222,what do you think you are doing,he asked her,routh
3223,3224,i am trespassing i know,i intended no harm,routh
3225,3226,i thought no one was home,have you been here before,routh
3227,3228,only to drive by,why,routh
3229,3230,could you lower that gun,it is making me very nervous,routh
3231,3232,well you made me nervous peeking into my windows,i am sorry,routh
3233,3234,i apologize,i have been stupid,routh
3235,3236,this is shameful,i will go,routh
3237,3238,what were you up to,you know what i was up to she said,routh
3239,3240,you tell me,i only wanted to see where she goes every weekend,routh
3241,3242,you are in a bad way,you drove from vermont to find that out,routh
3243,3244,she promised we had be together forever and three weeks later she left,i apologize again,routh
3245,3246,this has never happened to me before,i should never have come here,routh
3247,3248,and it probably does not help much your meeting me,it does not,routh
3249,3250,it makes you boil with jealousy he said,with hatred if you want the truth,routh
3251,3252,it is you who phoned last night,i am not completely in charge of myself she replied,routh
3253,3254,you are obsessed so you phone you are obsessed so you stalk,you are a very attractive woman nonetheless,routh
3255,3256,i have never been told that before by a man with a gun,i do not know why she left you for me he said,routh
3257,3258,oh do not you,you are a redhaired valkyrie and i am an old man,routh
3259,3260,an old man who is a star mr,axler,routh
3261,3262,do not pretend to be no one,would you like to come inside,routh
3263,3264,he asked,why,routh
3265,3266,do you want to seduce me too,is that your specialty retooling lesbians,routh
3267,3268,madam it is not i who was the peeping tom,it is not i who phoned her parents in michigan at midnight,routh
3269,3270,it is not i who anonymously phoned mr,famous last night,routh
3271,3272,no need to take the accusatory tone so quickly,i am not myself,routh
3273,3274,do you think she is worth it,no,routh
3275,3276,of course not she said,she is not at all beautiful,routh
3277,3278,she is not that intelligent,and she is not that grown up,routh
3279,3280,she is an unusually childish person for her age,she is a kid really,routh
3281,3282,she turned her montana lover into a man,she is turned me into a beggar,routh
3283,3284,who knows what she is turning you into,she leaves a trail of disaster,routh
3285,3286,where does the power come from,take a guess he said,routh
3287,3288,is it that that makes for disaster,the dean asked,routh
3289,3290,something about her sexually is very potent he said and saw her cringe at the words,but then it could not be easy for the loser to stand there and confront the person who had won,routh
3291,3292,there is plenty that is potent the dean said,she is a girlboy,routh
3293,3294,she is a childadult,there is an adolescent in her that is not grown up,routh
3295,3296,she is a cunning naif,but it is not her sexuality on its own that does itit is us,routh
3297,3298,it is we who endow her with the power to wreck,pegeen is nobody you know,routh
3299,3300,you would not be suffering so if she were nobody,she would not be here if she were nobody,routh
3301,3302,look you might as well step inside,then you can see everything up close,routh
3303,3304,and he could hear more about pegeen seared though her observations would be by pegeen is having exploited her,yes he wanted to hear her speak out of the depths of her wound about the closest person on earth to him,routh
3305,3306,this has been more than enough the dean said,come inside he said,routh
3307,3308,no,are you afraid of me,routh
3309,3310,he asked,i have done something foolish for which i apologize,routh
3311,3312,i have trespassed and i am sorry,and now i had like you to let me go,routh
3313,3314,i am not holding you,you have a way of trying to turn the moral tables on me,routh
3315,3316,but i did not invite you here in the first place,then why do you want me to come inside,routh
3317,3318,because of the triumph it would be to sleep with the woman that pegeen used to sleep with,i have no such ambition,routh
3319,3320,i am satisfied with things as they are,i was being polite,routh
3321,3322,i could offer you a cup of coffee,no the dean said coldly,routh
3323,3324,no you want to fuck me,is that what you want me to want,routh
3325,3326,that is what you want,is that what you came here to try to get me to do,routh
3327,3328,so as to pay pegeen back in kind,all at once she could conceal her misery no longer and burst into tears,routh
3329,3330,too late too late she sobbed,he did not understand what she was referring to but he did not ask,routh
3331,3332,she cried with her face buried in her hands while he turned and with the gun at his side went back into the house through the rear door trying to believe that nothing louise had said about pegeen either there outside the house or the night before on the phone could possibly be taken seriously,when he called pegeen that night he made no reference to what had happened that afternoon nor did he tell pegeen about louise is visit when she came for the weekend nor while they were having sex was he able to keep the redhaired valkyrie out of his mind and the fantasy of what had not happened,routh
3333,3334,the pain from the spinal condition made it impossible for him to fuck her from above or even from the side and so he lay on his back and she mounted him supporting herself on her knees and her hands so as not to lower her weight onto his pelvis,at first she lost all her knowhow up there and he had to guide her with his two hands to give her the idea,routh
3335,3336,i do not know what to do pegeen said shyly,you are on a horse axler told her,routh
3337,3338,ride it,when he worked his thumb into her ass she sighed with pleasure and whispered nobody is ever put anything in there beforeunlikely he whispered backand when later he put his cock in there she took as much as she could of it until she could not take any more,routh
3339,3340,did it hurt,he asked her,routh
3341,3342,it hurt but it is you,often she would hold his cock in her palm afterward and stare as the erection subsided,routh
3343,3344,what are you contemplating,he asked,routh
3345,3346,it fills you up she said the way dildos and fingers do not,it is alive,routh
3347,3348,it is a living thing,she quickly mastered riding the horse and soon while she worked slowly up and down she began to say hit me and when he hit her she said mockingly is that as hard as you can do it,routh
3349,3350,your face is already red,harder she said,routh
3351,3352,okay but why,because i have given you permission to do it,routh
3353,3354,because it hurts,because it makes me feel like a little girl and it makes me feel like a whore,routh
3355,3356,go ahead,harder,routh
3357,3358,she had a small plastic bag of sex toys that she brought with her one weekend and she spilled them out on the sheets when they were getting ready for bed,he had seen his share of dildos but never other than in pictures the strapon leather harness that held the dildo secure and enabled one woman to mount and penetrate another,routh
3359,3360,he had asked her to bring her toys with her and now he watched as she pulled the harness over her thighs and on up to her hips where she tightened it like a belt,she looked like a gunslinger getting dressed a gunslinger with a swagger,routh
3361,3362,then she inserted a green rubber dildo into a slot in the harness that was just about level with her clitoris,she stood alongside the bed wearing only that,routh
3363,3364,let me see yours she said,he removed his pants and threw them over the side of the bed while she grabbed the green cock and having lubricated it first with baby oil pretended to masturbate like a man,routh
3365,3366,admiringly he said it looks authentic,you want me to fuck you with it,routh
3367,3368,no thanks he said,i would not hurt you she said cajolingly kittenishly lowering her voice,routh
3369,3370,i promise to be very gentle with you she said,funny but you do not look like you will be gentle,routh
3371,3372,you must not be deceived by appearances,oh let me she said laughing you will like it,routh
3373,3374,it is a new frontier,you will like it,routh
3375,3376,no i had prefer you to suck me off he said,while i wear my cock she said,routh
3377,3378,yes,while i wear my big thick green cock,routh
3379,3380,that is what i want,while i wear my big green cock and you play with my tits,routh
3381,3382,that sounds right,and after i suck you off she said you will suck me off,routh
3383,3384,you will go down on my big green cock,i could do that he said,routh
3385,3386,sothat you could do,you draw strange boundaries,routh
3387,3388,in any event you should know you are still a very twisted man to be turned on by a girl like me,i may well be a twisted man but i do not believe you qualify as a girl like you any longer,routh
3389,3390,oh do not you now,not with that twohundreddollar haircut,routh
3391,3392,not with those clothes,not with your own mother following your fashion in footwear,routh
3393,3394,her hand continued slowly pumping the dildo,you really think you have fucked the lesbian out of me in ten months,routh
3395,3396,are you telling me that you are still sleeping with women,he asked,routh
3397,3398,she just kept pumping the dildo,are you pegeen,routh
3399,3400,with her free hand she held up two fingers,what does that mean,routh
3401,3402,he asked,twice,routh
3403,3404,with louise,do not be crazy,routh
3405,3406,with whom then,she flushed,routh
3407,3408,two teams of girls were playing softball on the field i drive by on the way to school,i parked the car and i got out and went over and stood by the bench,routh
3409,3410,after a pause she confessed when the game was over the pitcher with the blond ponytail came to the house with me,and the second time,routh
3411,3412,the other pitcher with the blond ponytail,that leaves quite a few players waiting their turn he said,routh
3413,3414,i did not intend to do it she said still stroking the green cock,perhaps pegeen mike he said falling into the irish accent he had not used since acting in playboy you should tell me if you have plans to do it again,routh
3415,3416,i had rather you would not he said knowing himself helpless to hold on to her and keep her his alone knowing that his ardor had been laughableand trying to hide his feelings behind the brogue,i told you i was not planning to do it at all and then either because desire had overpowered her or because she wanted to shut him up she lowered her lips down the length of his cock while his gaze remained hypnotically fastened to hers and the helplessness in him the knowledge that the affair was a futile folly and that pegeen is history was unmalleable and pegeen unattainable and that he was bringing a new misfortune down on his head began to abate,routh
3417,3418,the oddity of this combination would have put off many people,only the oddity was what was so exciting,routh
3419,3420,but the terror remained too the terror of going back to being completely finished,the terror of becoming the next louise the reproachful crazed avenging ex,routh
3421,3422,pegeens father had not helped things any when he had come to see her in new york on the saturday following her mother is visit,asa picked up where carol had left off in citing the dangers of their liaison moving from her lover is perilous age to his perilous psychiatric condition,routh
3423,3424,axler is strategy remained the same however tolerate whatever you hear do not rush to challenge the parents so long as pegeen does not yield,your mother was rightthat is a wonderful haircut she had reported her father is telling her,routh
3425,3426,and she was right about your clothes too he had said,yes,routh
3427,3428,do you think i look nice,you look terrific he had said,routh
3429,3430,better than i used to,different,routh
3431,3432,quite different,do i look more like the daughter you would have liked to have had,routh
3433,3434,you certainly have an air you never had before,now tell me about simon,routh
3435,3436,after the hard time he had at the kennedy center she had said he wound up at a psychiatric hospital,is that what you want to talk about,routh
3437,3438,she had asked,yes it is he had said,routh
3439,3440,we all have serious problems dad,we all have serious problems but we do not all wind up in psychiatric hospitals,routh
3441,3442,while we are at it she had said what about the difference in age,do not you want to ask about that,routh
3443,3444,let me ask you something else are you starstruck pegeen,you know how certain kinds of characters carry around their force field an encircling electric force field,routh
3445,3446,it comes in his case with being a star,are you starstruck,routh
3447,3448,she had laughed,at the beginning probably,routh
3449,3450,by this time i assure you he is just himself,may i ask how committed you are to each other,routh
3451,3452,he had said,we do not really talk about it,routh
3453,3454,maybe you ought to talk about it with me then,are you going to marry him pegeen,routh
3455,3456,i do not think he is interested in marrying anyone,are you,routh
3457,3458,why are you treating me as though i am twelve,she had said,routh
3459,3460,because it may be that where men are concerned you are more twelve than forty,look simon axler is an intriguing actor and probably to a woman an intriguing man,routh
3461,3462,but he is the age he is and you are the age you are,he has had the life he is had with its triumphant ups and its cataclysmic downs and you have had the life you have had,routh
3463,3464,and because those downs of his worry me greatly i am not going to talk about them as glibly as you do,i am not going to tell you that i am not going to try to bring any pressure to bear on you,routh
3465,3466,i am going to do just that,and that he didunlike the mother he did not end the day shopping with his daughter but instead he phoned her at her house every night around dinnertime to continue in much the same strong vein the conversation that had begun at lunch in new york,routh
3467,3468,rarely did father and daughter speak for less than an hour,in bed the evening after she had seen her father in new york axler had said to her i want you to know pegeen that i am flabbergasted by all this stuff with your parents,routh
3469,3470,i do not understand the place they are coming to play in our lives,it seems entirely too large and all things considered a little absurd,routh
3471,3472,on the other hand i recognize that at any stage of life there are mysteries about people and their attachments to their parents that can be surprising,this being so let me make a proposal if you want me to fly out to michigan and talk to your father i will fly out to michigan and i will sit and listen to every word he wants to say and when he tells me why he is against this i wo not even arguei will side with him,routh
3473,3474,i will tell him that everything he is concerned about makes perfect sense and that i agreeit is an unlikely arrangement on the face of it and there are to be sure risks involved,but the fact remains that his daughter and i feel as we do about each other,routh
3475,3476,and the fact that he and carol and i were friends as youngsters back in new york is of no relevance whatsoever,that is the only defense i will make pegeen if you want me to go and see him,routh
3477,3478,it is up to you,i will do it this week if you want me to,routh
3479,3480,i will do it tomorrow if that is what you want,his seeing me was quite enough she replied,routh
3481,3482,there is no need for this to be carried further,especially as you have made it clear that you think it is already been carried too far,routh
3483,3484,i am not so sure you are right he said,better to take on the raging fatherbut my father is not raging it is not in his nature to rage and i do not think there is any need to provoke a scene when there is not a scene in the offing,routh
3485,3486,he thought oh there is a scene in the offing all rightthe two upstanding squares you have for parents are not through,but he only said to her okay,routh
3487,3488,i simply wanted to make the offer,it is finally up to you,routh
3489,3490,but was that so,was not it up to him to neutralize them by opposing them rather than by simply leaving things to turn out opportunely on their own,routh
3491,3492,he should in fact have accompanied her to new yorkhe should have insisted on being there and facing asa down,despite what pegeen had said to assure him he was reluctant to give up the idea that asa was a father in a rage whom he should confront rather than flee,routh
3493,3494,are you starstruck,of course that is what he would believe he who never got the big roles,routh
3495,3496,yes thought axler that my fame stole away his only daughter the fame that asa himself could never garner,it was in the middle of the next week that he got around to reading the previous friday is county newspaper and the frontpage story about a murder that had taken place in a welltodo suburban town some twentyfive miles away,routh
3497,3498,a man in his forties a successful plastic surgeon had been shot dead by his estranged wife,the wife was sybil van buren,routh
3499,3500,the two were apparently living apart by then,she had driven to his house across town from hers and as soon as he opened the door had shot him twice in the chest killing him instantly,routh
3501,3502,she had dropped the murder weapon on the doorstep then gone back and sat in her parked car until the police came and took her to the station to be booked,when she had left home that morning she had already arranged for the babysitter to spend the day with the two children,routh
3503,3504,axler phoned pegeen and told her what had happened,did you think she could have done this,routh
3505,3506,pegeen asked,such a helpless person,routh
3507,3508,no,never,routh
3509,3510,she had the motivethe molestationbut homicide,she asked if i would murder him for her,routh
3511,3512,she said i need someone to kill this evil man,what a shocking story pegeen said,routh
3513,3514,this fragilelooking woman built on the frailest childlike scale,the least menacing person one could encounter,routh
3515,3516,they will never convict her pegeen said,maybe they will maybe they wo not,routh
3517,3518,maybe she will plead temporary insanity and get off,but what will become of her then,routh
3519,3520,what will become of the child,if the little girl was not already doomed because of what the stepfather did now she is doomed because of what her mother is done,routh
3521,3522,not to mention their little boy,would you like me to come tonight,routh
3523,3524,you sound shaky,no no he said,routh
3525,3526,i am all right,i have just never known anyone who is killed somebody off the stage,routh
3527,3528,i am going to come over later pegeen said,and when she did they sat in the living room after dinner and he repeated to her in detail everything he remembered sybil van buren saying to him at the hospital,routh
3529,3530,he found her letterthe letter that had been mailed to him in care of jerry is officeand gave it to pegeen to read,the husband claimed to be innocent axler explained,routh
3531,3532,he claimed she was seeing things,was she,routh
3533,3534,i did not think so,i saw her suffering,routh
3535,3536,i believed her story,during the day he had read the article again and again and repeatedly looked at the photograph of sybil that the paper had published a studio portrait in which she looked less like a married woman in her thirties let alone a clytemnestra than like a high school cheerleader someone who as yet had been through nothing in life,routh
3537,3538,the following day he phoned information and easy as that got the van burens phone number,when he called a woman answered who identified herself as sybil is sister,routh
3539,3540,he told her who he was and told her about sybil is letter,he read it to her over the phone,routh
3541,3542,they agreed she would pass it on to sybil is lawyer,are you able to see her,routh
3543,3544,he asked,only with the lawyer,routh
3545,3546,she gets teary about not seeing the children,otherwise she is unnervingly calm,routh
3547,3548,does she talk about the murder,she says it had to be done,routh
3549,3550,you had think it was her fiftieth not her first,she is in a very strange state,routh
3551,3552,the gravity seems to escape her,it is as though the gravity is all behind her,routh
3553,3554,for the moment he said,i have been thinking the same,routh
3555,3556,there is a great crash going to occur,she wo not be living behind this placid mask for long,routh
3557,3558,there must be a suicide watch on her cell,i am frightened of what is coming next,routh
3559,3560,of course,what she did in no way jibes with the woman i knew,routh
3561,3562,why did she do this after all this time,because even when john moved out he continued to deny everything and to tell her that she was delusional and that put her into a mad frenzy,routh
3563,3564,on the morning that she was going to see him she told me that by whatever means it took she was going to extract a confession from him,i said  hado not see him,routh
3565,3566,it will only drive you over the edge,and i was right,routh
3567,3568,i was the one who had wanted her to go to the district attorney and bring charges,i was the one who told her that she should have him put behind bars,routh
3569,3570,but she refused he was not a nobody and the case would wind up in the papers and on tv and alison would get dragged into a courtroom nightmare to be exposed to yet more horror,her saying this is why i never dreamed that extracting a confession by any means would involve the use of his hunting rifleusing his hunting rifle might wind up in the papers too you see,routh
3571,3572,but when she got to john is that saturday morning she did not wait for him to let her into the house,she did not wait to hear him speak a single word,routh
3573,3574,it is not that they had an argument and it escalated and she shot him,seeing his face was all it tookright there in the front doorway she pulled the trigger twice and he was dead,routh
3575,3576,she told me he wanted mayhem so i gave him mayhem,does the little girl know anything,routh
3577,3578,she has not been told yet,that is not going to be easy,routh
3579,3580,nothing about this is going to be easy,the late dr,routh
3581,3582,van buren made sure of that,the suffering that is going to be alison is is unimaginable to me,routh
3583,3584,axler repeated to himself for days afterward the suffering that is going to be alison is,it was probably the very thought that had driven sybil to murder her husbandthereby enlarging alison is suffering forever,routh
3585,3586,one night in bed pegeen said to him i have found a girl for you,she is on the prescott swim team,routh
3587,3588,i swim with her in the afternoon,lara,routh
3589,3590,how would you like me to bring you lara,she was slowly rising and falling above him and all the lights were out though the room was dimly lit by the full moon shining through the branches of the tall trees out back of the house,routh
3591,3592,tell me about lara he said,oh you had like her all right,routh
3593,3594,obviously you do already,i watch her in the pool,routh
3595,3596,i watch her in the locker room,a rich kid,routh
3597,3598,a privileged kid,she is never known a minute is hardship,routh
3599,3600,she is perfect,blond,routh
3601,3602,crystal blue eyes,long legs,routh
3603,3604,strong legs,perfect breasts,routh
3605,3606,how perfect,it makes you awfully hard to hear about lara she said,routh
3607,3608,the breasts he said,she is nineteen,routh
3609,3610,they are solid and they are just up there,her cunt is shaved and there is just a fringe of blond hair to either side,routh
3611,3612,who is fucking her,the boys or the girls,routh
3613,3614,i do not know yet,but somebody is been having some fun down there,routh
3615,3616,from then on lara was with them whenever they wanted her,you are fucking her pegeen would say,routh
3617,3618,that is lara is perfect little pussy,you fucking her too,routh
3619,3620,no,just you,routh
3621,3622,close your eyes,you want her to make you come,routh
3623,3624,you want lara to make you come,all right you blond little bitchmake him come,routh
3625,3626,pegeen cried and no longer did he have to tell her how to ride the horse,squirt it all over her,routh
3627,3628,now,now,routh
3629,3630,yes that is itsquirt in her face,they went to a local inn one night for dinner,routh
3631,3632,from the rustic dining room you could see out over the road to a big lake emblazoned by the sunset,she wore her newest clothes they had gone shopping for them on an impulsive visit to new york the week before a little clinging black jersey skirt a red cashmere sleeveless shell with a red cashmere cardigan knotted over her shoulders sheer black stockings a soft leather shoulder bag trimmed with small leather streamers and on her feet a pair of pointy black slingbacks cut to show the cleavage of the foot,routh
3633,3634,she looked soft and curvaceous and enticing red above and everything black from the waist down and she carried herself with such casual comfort that she might have been dressing like that all her life,she wore the shoulder bag as the saleswoman had suggested with the strap slung across her body like a bandolier and the bag riding her hip,routh
3635,3636,to try to prevent his back from locking and his leg from going dead it was his habit to get up and walk around two or three times during a meal and so after the main course and before dessert axler stood and for the second time strolled through the restaurant and across the inn is public sitting room and into the bar,there he saw an attractive young woman drinking by herself,routh
3637,3638,she must have been in her twenties and from the way she was talking to the bartender he could tell she was a little drunk,he smiled when she looked his way and so as to prolong his stay he asked the bartender if he knew the ball score,routh
3639,3640,then he asked her if she was local or staying at the inn,she said she had just taken a job at the antique shop down the road and had stopped in after work for a drink,routh
3641,3642,he asked if she knew anything about antiques and she said her parents owned an antique shop farther upstate,she had been working at a shop in greenwich village for three years and had decided to get away from the city and try her luck in washington county,routh
3643,3644,he asked how long she had been out here and she said she had arrived only the month before,he asked what she was drinking and when she told him he said next one is on me and indicated to the bartender that he should put the drink on his tab,routh
3645,3646,when dessert arrived he said to pegeen there is a girl at the bar getting drunk,what does she look like,routh
3647,3648,like she can take care of herself,you want to,routh
3649,3650,if you do he said,how old is she,routh
3651,3652,she said,i had say twentyeight,routh
3653,3654,you had be in charge,you and the green cock,routh
3655,3656,you had be in charge she said to him,you and the real cock,routh
3657,3658,we had be in charge together he said,i want to see her she said,routh
3659,3660,he paid the bill and they left the restaurant and went to stand in the doorway of the bar,he stood behind pegeen with his arms encircling her,routh
3661,3662,he could feel her trembling with excitement as she watched the girl drinking at the bar,her trembling thrilled him,routh
3663,3664,it was as though they had merged into one maniacally tempted being,you like her,routh
3665,3666,he whispered,she looks as if she could be quite indecent given half a chance,routh
3667,3668,she looks like she is ready for a life of crime,you want to take her home,routh
3669,3670,she is not lara but she had do,what if she vomits in the car,routh
3671,3672,you think she is about to,she is been at it a long time,routh
3673,3674,when she passes out at the house how do we get rid of her,murder her pegeen said,routh
3675,3676,while still closely holding pegeen in front of him he called across the bar do you need a ride young lady,tracy,routh
3677,3678,do you need a ride tracy,i have got my car tracy replied,routh
3679,3680,are you in any shape to drive it,i can drop you off at home,routh
3681,3682,pegeen was still quivering in his arms,she is a cat he thought before the cat pounces the falcon before it soars from the falconer is wrist,routh
3683,3684,the animal you can controluntil you let it loose,he thought i am providing her tracy the way i give her the clothes,routh
3685,3686,everyone felt emboldened with lara because there was no lara there and so no consequences,this he knew to be different,routh
3687,3688,it dawned on him that he was ceding all the power to pegeen,i can get my husband to pick me up tracy said,routh
3689,3690,he had noticed earlier that she wore no wedding ring,no let us drive you,routh
3691,3692,where do you want to go,tracy mentioned a town twelve miles to the west,routh
3693,3694,the bartender who knew axler lived in the opposite direction went about his job as if he were a deafmute,because of axler is movies practically everyone in the rural town of nine hundred knew who he was though few had any idea that his reputation rested on his lifetime is achievement on the stage,routh
3695,3696,the drunken young woman paid her bill and climbed off the stool and grabbed her jacket to leave,she was taller than he had imagined and larger tooa stray perhaps but no waifa buxom blond with an extensive body and a kind of readymade nordic prettiness,routh
3697,3698,in all a coarser commonplace version of stately louise,he put tracy in the back seat with pegeen and drove them along the dark country roads empty of traffic to his house,routh
3699,3700,it was as though they were abducting her,the swiftness with which pegeen moved did not take him by surprise,routh
3701,3702,she was not constrained by inhibition or fear as she had been when she had gotten her haircut and he was already enthralled merely by what he could hear from the back of the car,in the bedroom at home pegeen emptied onto the bed her plastic bag of implements among them the toylike catoninetails with its very soft thin wisps of black unknotted leather,routh
3703,3704,axler wondered what was going on in tracy is mind,she gets into a car with two people she is never seen before they drive her to a house on a dirt road deep in the country and then she steps out of the car into a threering circus,routh
3705,3706,she may be drunk but she is also young,how oblivious to risk can she be,routh
3707,3708,or do pegeen and i inspire trust,or is risk what tracy is looking for,routh
3709,3710,or is she too drunk to care,he wondered if she had ever done anything like this before,routh
3711,3712,he wondered again why she was doing it now,it did not make sense that this tracy should fall into their laps to do all of the laralike stuff they had been dreaming excitedly about in bed,routh
3713,3714,though what did make sense,his being unable to go out and act on a stage,routh
3715,3716,his having been a psychiatric inpatient,his conducting a love affair with a lesbian whom he had first seen nursing at her mother is breast,routh
3717,3718,when a man gets two women together it is not unusual for one of the women rightly or wrongly feeling neglected to wind up crying in a corner of the room,from how this was going so far it looked as though the one who had wind up crying in the corner would be him,routh
3719,3720,yet as he watched from the far side of the bed he did not feel painfully overlooked,he had let pegeen appoint herself ringmaster and would not participate until summoned,routh
3721,3722,he would watch without interfering,first pegeen stepped into the contraption adjusted and secured the leather straps and affixed the dildo so that it jutted straight out,routh
3723,3724,then she crouched above tracy brushing tracy is lips and nipples with her mouth and fondling her breasts and then she slid down a ways and gently penetrated tracy with the dildo,pegeen did not have to force her open,routh
3725,3726,she did not have to say a wordhe imagined that if either one of them did begin to speak it would be in a language unrecognizable to him,the green cock plunged in and out of the abundant naked body sprawled beneath it slow at first then faster and harder then harder still and all of tracy is curves and hollows moved in unison with it,routh
3727,3728,this was not soft porn,this was no longer two unclothed women caressing and kissing on a bed,routh
3729,3730,there was something primitive about it now this womanonwoman violence as though in the room filled with shadows pegeen were a magical composite of shaman acrobat and animal,it was as if she were wearing a mask on her genitals a weird totem mask that made her into what she was not and was not supposed to be,routh
3731,3732,she could as well have been a crow or a coyote while simultaneously pegeen mike,there was something dangerous about it,routh
3733,3734,his heart thumped with excitementthe god pan looking on from a distance with his spying lascivious gaze,it was english that pegeen spoke when she looked over from where she was now resting on her back beside tracy combing the little black catoninetails through tracy is long hair and with that kidlike smile that showed her two front teeth said to him softly your turn,routh
3735,3736,defile her,she took tracy by one shoulder whispered time to change masters and gently rolled the stranger is large warm body toward his,routh
3737,3738,three children got together he said and decided to put on a play whereupon his performance began,around midnight they drove tracy back to the lot beside the inn where she had left her car,routh
3739,3740,you two do this often,tracy asked from the back seat where she lay encircled by pegeen is arms,routh
3741,3742,no pegeen said,do you,routh
3743,3744,never in my life,so what do you think,routh
3745,3746,asked pegeen,i ca not think,routh
3747,3748,my head is too crammed with everything to think,i feel tripped out,routh
3749,3750,i feel like i have taken drugs,where did you get the bravado for this,routh
3751,3752,pegeen asked her,the booze,routh
3753,3754,your clothes,the way you looked,routh
3755,3756,i thought i have nothing to fear,tell me is he that actor,routh
3757,3758,tracy asked pegeen as though he were not in the car,he is pegeen said,routh
3759,3760,that is what the bartender said,are you an actress,routh
3761,3762,she asked pegeen,off and on pegeen said,routh
3763,3764,it was crazy tracy said,it was pegeen replied the wielder of the catoninetails and connoisseur of the dildo who was herself no dabbler who had indeed carried things to the limit,routh
3765,3766,tracy kissed pegeen passionately when they said goodnight,passionately pegeen returned the kiss and stroked her hair and clutched her breasts and in the parking lot beside the inn where they had all met the two momentarily clung together,routh
3767,3768,then tracy got into her car and before she drove off he heard pegeen tell her see you soon,they drove home with pegeen is hand down in his pants,routh
3769,3770,the smell she said it is on us while axler thought i miscalculatedi did not think it through,he was the god pan no longer,routh
3771,3772,far from it,while pegeen showered he sat downstairs in the kitchen and had a cup of tea as if nothing had happened as if another ordinary night had been passed at home,routh
3773,3774,the tea the cup the saucer the sugar the creamall answered a need for the matteroffact,i want to have a child,routh
3775,3776,he imagined pegeen speaking those words,he imagined her telling him when she came into the kitchen after the shower i want to have a child,routh
3777,3778,he was imagining the least likely thing that might happen which was why he was imagining it he was out to force his foolhardiness back into a domestic container,with whom,routh
3779,3780,he imagined himself asking her,with you,routh
3781,3782,you are the choice of my life,as your family has duly warned you i am closing in on seventy,routh
3783,3784,when the child is ten i will be seventyfive seventysix,by then i may not be your choice,routh
3785,3786,i will be in a wheelchair with this spine of mine if not already dead,forget about my family he imagined her saying,routh
3787,3788,i want you to be the father of my child,are you going to keep this a secret from asa and carol,routh
3789,3790,no,all that is over,routh
3791,3792,you were right,louise did me a favor with that phone call,routh
3793,3794,no more secrecy,they will have to live with things as they are,routh
3795,3796,and where did this desire come from to mother a child,from becoming what i have become for you,routh
3797,3798,he imagined himself saying who could have foreseen this evening taking this turn,not at all he imagined pegeen replying,routh
3799,3800,it is the next step,if we are to continue i want three things,routh
3801,3802,i want you to have back surgery,i want you to resume your career,routh
3803,3804,i want you to impregnate me,you want a lot,routh
3805,3806,who taught me to want a lot,he imagined her saying,routh
3807,3808,that is my proposal for a real life,what more can i offer,routh
3809,3810,back surgery is very tricky,the doctors i have seen say it would do no good in my case,routh
3811,3812,you ca not go on locked up with that pain,you ca not go on hobbling around forever,routh
3813,3814,and my career is trickier still,no he imagined her saying it is a matter of adopting a plan to end the uncertainty,routh
3815,3816,a bold longterm plan,that is all that is required he imagined himself answering,routh
3817,3818,yes,it is time to be bold with yourself,routh
3819,3820,if anything it sounds like it is time to be cautious,but because in her company he had begun to be rejuvenated because he had done everything in his power to get himself to believe that she who had begun by offering him a glass of wateronly to go from there to pulling off the feat of feats the sexchange actcould indeed make contentment real with him he thought the most hopeful thoughts he could,routh
3821,3822,in this kitchen reverie of the rectified life he imagined himself seeing an orthopedist who sent him for an mri and after that for a presurgical myelogram and after that for surgery,meanwhile he would have contacted jerry oppenheim and told him that if anyone wanted to offer him a role he was available to work again,routh
3823,3824,then still at the kitchen table exciting himself by elaborating these thoughts while pegeen finished showering upstairs he imagined pegeen having a healthy baby the very month that he opened at the guthrie theater in the role of james tyrone,he would have found vincent daniels is card where he had left it as a bookmark in the copy of long day is journey,routh
3825,3826,he would have gone to see vincent daniels with the script and they would have worked together every day until they found the way to get him to stop distrusting himself so that when he went onstage at the guthrie on opening night the lost magic returned and he knew while the words were flying so naturally so effortlessly out of his mouth that he was in the midst of a performance as good as any he had ever given and that maybe being incapacitated for so long however painful had not been the worst thing that could have happened,now the audience believed him anew in every moment,routh
3827,3828,where previously confronting the scariest part of actingthe line saying something saying something spontaneously with freedom and easehe had felt himself naked without the protection of any approach now everything was once again emanating from instinct and he needed no other means of approach,the stretch of bad luck was over,routh
3829,3830,the selfinflicted torment was over,he had recovered his confidence the grief was displaced the abominable fear was dispelled and everything that had fled him was back where it belonged,routh
3831,3832,the reconstruction of a life had to begin somewhere and for him it had started with falling for pegeen stapleford amazingly just the woman to have recruited for the job,it seemed to him now that the kitchen scenario was no longer the aery tale with which he had begun but that he was imagining a new possibility a reclamation of exuberance that it was his intention to fight for and to implement and to enjoy,routh
3833,3834,axler felt the determination that was originally his when he came to new york to audition at the age of twentytwo,the next morning as soon as pegeen had left to drive back to vermont he called a hospital in new york and asked for a doctor with whom he could consult about the genetic hazards of fathering a child at sixtyfive,routh
3835,3836,he was referred to the office of a specialist and given an appointment for the following week,he said nothing about any of this to pegeen,routh
3837,3838,the hospital was far uptown and after parking the car in a garage he made his way with mounting excitement to the doctor is office,he was given the usual medical forms to fill out and then greeted by a filipino man of about thirtyfive who said he was dr,routh
3839,3840,wan is assistant,there was a windowed room off the waiting area and the assistant led him there so that they could be alone,routh
3841,3842,it seemed a room designed to be used by children with low tables and small chairs scattered about and children is drawings pinned to one wall,the two of them sat at one of the tables and the assistant began to ask him about himself and his family and the diseases they had suffered from and the diseases they had died of,routh
3843,3844,the doctor is assistant recorded the answers on a sheet of paper printed with the skeleton of a family tree,axler told him as much as he knew from as far back as his knowledge of the family extended,routh
3845,3846,then the assistant took a second sheet and asked about the family of the prospective mother,axler could tell him only that pegeen is parents were both living he knew nothing about their medical histories or those of pegeen is aunts uncles grandparents and greatgrandparents,routh
3847,3848,the assistant asked for her family is country of origin as he had asked for axler is and having recorded the information told axler that he would give all the data to dr,wan and that after he and the doctor had conferred she would come out to talk to axler,routh
3849,3850,alone in the room axler felt ecstatic with the return of his force and his naturalness and the abandonment of his humiliation and the end of his disappearance from the world,this was not reverie any longer the revitalization of simon axler was truly under way,routh
3851,3852,and under way in this room full of children is furniture of all places,the scale of the furniture reminded him of the art therapy session at hammerton when he and sybil van buren had been given crayons and paper in order to draw pictures for their therapist,routh
3853,3854,he remembered how he had obediently set to coloring with the crayons like the child he had once been in kindergarten class,he remembered the mortifying consequences of having ended up in hammerton how every trace of assuredness had vanished he remembered how all he found to deliver him from a pervasive sense of defeat and dread was the conversation that he listened to in the rec room after dinner the stories of those among the hospitalized infatuated still with how they had tried to kill themselves,routh
3855,3856,now however a huge man sitting awkwardly amid these little tables and chairs he was at one with the actor conscious of the achievement behind him and convinced that life could begin again,dr,routh
3857,3858,wan was a small slender young woman who said that she would of course need pegeen is history too but that she could begin at least to address his fears about birth defects in the offspring of aging fathers,she told him that although the ideal age for men to father children is their twenties and although the risk of passing on genetic vulnerability or developmental disorders like autism is significantly increased after forty and although older men had more sperm with damaged dna than younger men the odds of fathering normal offspring without birth defects were not necessarily dire for a man of his age and health especially as some though not all birth defects could be detected during pregnancy,routh
3859,3860,the testicular cells that give rise to sperm divide every sixteen days dr,wan explained to him while they sat across from each other at the little table,routh
3861,3862,this means that the cells have split about eight hundred times by age fifty,and with each cell division the chance increases for errors in the sperm is dna,routh
3863,3864,once pegeen had provided her with the other half of the story she could more fully evaluate their situation and work with them together should they wish to proceed further,she gave him her card along with a pamphlet that spelled out in detail the nature and risk of birth defects,routh
3865,3866,she also explained that there might be decreased fertility at his age and so at his request she provided him with a referral to a laboratory to have a sperm analysis,that way they could determine if there was likely to be any difficulty with conception,routh
3867,3868,there can be a problem she told him of sperm count of motility or morphology,i understand he said and to express an uncontrollable sense of gratitude reached out to clutch her hand,routh
3869,3870,the doctor smiled at him as if she were the older of the two and said call me if you have questions,back at home he had an enormous urge to phone pegeen and tell her of the great idea that had taken hold of him and what he had done about it,routh
3871,3872,but that conversation would have to wait until they were together the following weekend and had hours and hours to talk,alone in bed that night he read the pamphlet dr,routh
3873,3874,wan had given him,it takes healthy sperm to make a healthy baby,routh
3875,3876,about 2 to 3 percent of all babies are born with a major birth defect,more than 20 rare but devastating genetic disorders have been linked to aging fathers,routh
3877,3878,the older a man is when he conceives a child the more likely his partner is to miscarry,older fathers are more likely to have children with autism schizophrenia and down syndrome,routh
3879,3880,he went through the pamphlet once and then again and sobering as he found the information mindful as he now was of the risks he would not be dissuaded from his plans by what he read,instead too excited to sleep thinking something wonderful was happening he found himself down in the living room further enlivened by listening to music and along with feelings of fearlessness such as he had not known for years experiencing the deep biological longing for a child that is more commonly associated with a woman than with a man,routh
3881,3882,nothing about their being together seemed improbable any longer,she had to go with him to see dr,routh
3883,3884,wan,once everyone had the whole story the two of them would soberly assess what should come next,routh
3885,3886,he had planned to begin the conversation after dinner on friday evening,but when pegeen arrived for the weekend late friday afternoon she went off to her study with a slew of student exams to mark and left it to him to make dinner,routh
3887,3888,and after dinner she withdrew again to the study to grade more exams,he thought let her get everything done now,routh
3889,3890,then we will have the weekend to talk,in bed in the darktwo weeks to the day after the tryst with tracywhen he began to kiss and to fondle pegeen she pulled away and said my heart is not in it tonight,routh
3891,3892,all right he said and unable to arouse her rolled over to his side but without relinquishing her hand which he held on to with his own handthe hand that still wanted to touch everythinguntil she had fallen asleep,when he awakened in the middle of the night he wondered what did it mean that her heart was not in it why had she been so unwilling to be near him from the moment she had arrived,routh
3893,3894,he found out first thing the next morning before he even had a chance to begin to tell her about his meeting with dr,wan and all that lay behind that meeting and all that potentially lay ahead of them he found out that in going to see dr,routh
3895,3896,wan he had not so much educated himself in order to avoid doing something rash as to dig himself deeper into an unreal world,this is the end she said to axler at the breakfast table,routh
3897,3898,each was seated across from the other in the very chairs as when she had told him in months gone by that they had already taken the risk,end of what,routh
3899,3900,he asked,of this,routh
3901,3902,but why,it is not what i want,routh
3903,3904,i made a mistake,so began the end as abruptly as that and it concluded some thirty minutes later with pegeen at the front door clutching her full duffle bag and axler in tears,routh
3905,3906,this was the very antithesis of his expectations that night in the kitchen two weeks back,the very antithesis of his expectations when he had gone to see dr,routh
3907,3908,wan,everything he wanted she was preventing him from having,routh
3909,3910,and she was crying now as well it was not as easy to pull off as it had seemed in the first moment at the kitchen table,but still she would not be budged and however much he wept she remained silent,routh
3911,3912,the picture she made at the front door back in her boy is zippered red jacket and holding her duffle bag expressed it all this form of hardship she could endure,she was not about to sit down over a cup of coffee and have a hearttoheart talk that would lead to a rapprochement,routh
3913,3914,she wanted only to be free of him and to satisfy the common enough human wish to move on and try something else,you cannot nullify everything,routh
3915,3916,he shouted angrily and with that pegeen the mightier of the two opened the door,at last she spoke sobbing,routh
3917,3918,i tried to be perfect for you,what the hell does that mean,routh
3919,3920,was it ever a matter of being perfect,hado not pull away from me,routh
3921,3922,i love this and i do not want it to stop,i was idiot enough to believe what you said,routh
3923,3924,i was idiot enough to think you were doing what you wanted to do,it was what i wanted to do,routh
3925,3926,i wanted so much to see if i could do it,so it was an experiment right down to the end,routh
3927,3928,another adventure for pegeen mikelike picking up a pitcher on a softball team,i ca not be a substitute for your acting anymore,routh
3929,3930,oh do not pull that,that is disgusting,routh
3931,3932,but it is true,i am what you have instead of that,routh
3933,3934,i am supposed to make up for that,that is the most ludicrous bullshit i have ever heard,routh
3935,3936,and you know it,go pegeen,routh
3937,3938,if that is your vindication go,we took the risk,routh
3939,3940,i took the risk,you just said whatever you thought i wanted to hear so that you could get what you wanted as long as you wanted it,routh
3941,3942,i did no such thing,she cried,routh
3943,3944,it is tracy is not it,what is,routh
3945,3946,you are dumping me for tracy,i am not simon,routh
3947,3948,no,you are not leaving me because i do not have a job,routh
3949,3950,you are leaving me for that girl,you are going to that girl,routh
3951,3952,where i go is my business,oh just let me go,routh
3953,3954,who is holding you back,not me,routh
3955,3956,never,he pointed at the duffle bag into which she had crammed all the new clothes of hers that had been hanging in his closets and folded in his bureau drawers,routh
3957,3958,pack your sex toys,he asked,routh
3959,3960,remember your harness,she did not answer but the emotion flashing through her was hatred or so he understood the look in her eyes,routh
3961,3962,yes he said take the tools of your trade and go,now your parents can sleep at nightyou are no longer with an old man,routh
3963,3964,now there is no interloper between you and your father,you are unburdened of your impediment,routh
3965,3966,no more admonitions from home,safely returned to your original position,routh
3967,3968,good,go on to the next one,routh
3969,3970,i never had the strength for you anyway,a man is way is laid with a multitude of traps and pegeen had been the last,routh
3971,3972,he had stepped hungrily into it and taken the bait like the most craven captive on earth,there was no other way for it to wind up and yet he was the last to find out,routh
3973,3974,improbable,no predictable,routh
3975,3976,abandoned after so long,clearly not so long for her as for him,routh
3977,3978,everything enchanting about her was gone and in the time it had taken her to say this is the end he was condemned to his hole with the six sticks alone and emptied of the desire to live,she left in her car and the process of collapse took less than five minutes a collapse from a fall brought on himself and from which there was now no recovery,routh
3979,3980,he went up to the attic and sat there for a whole day and well into the night preparing to pull the trigger of his shotgun and intermittently ready to rush down the stairs and wake jerry oppenheim at home ready to call hammerton and speak to his doctor ready to dial 911,and at a dozen different moments throughout the day ready to call lansing and tell asa what a treacherous son of a bitch he was to have turned pegeen against him,routh
3981,3982,that was how it had happened he was sure,pegeen had been right all along to want to keep the news of their affair from her family,routh
3983,3984,because they have known you so long she had explained to him when he had asked why she preferred to keep him a secret,because you are all the same age,routh
3985,3986,had he made the trip to michigan when he first suggested to pegeen his going out there to talk to asa he might perhaps have had a chance to win,but to phone asa now would accomplish nothing,routh
3987,3988,pegeen was gone,gone to tracy,routh
3989,3990,gone to lara,gone to the pitcher with the ponytail,routh
3991,3992,wherever she was he no longer had to worry about the genetic hazards of being an aging father with testicular cells that had already divided well over eight hundred times,by dinnertime he could restrain himself no longer and carrying the gun with him he came down from the attic to the phone,routh
3993,3994,carol answered,it is simon axler,routh
3995,3996,why yes,hello simon,routh
3997,3998,let me speak to asa,his voice was trembling and his heartbeat had quickened,routh
3999,4000,he had to sit in a kitchen chair to continue,it was very like the way he had felt in washington the last time he had tried to go out on a stage to perform,routh
