1789,1790,and do them herself when pa wa nt there,she would fix him special thing to eat and hide them for him,faulkner
1791,1792,and that may have been when i first found it out that addi bundren should be hide anyth she did who had tri to teach us that deceit wa such that in a world where it wa noth els could be veri bad or veri import not even poverti,and at time when i went in to go to bed she would be sit in the dark by jewel where he wa asleep,faulkner

1833,1834,a fellow kind of hate to see,wallow in somebodi els s mire,faulkner
1835,1836,that s what he wa tri to say,when someth is new and hard and bright there ought to be someth a littl better for it than just be safe sinc the safe thing are just the thing that folk have been do so long they have worn the edg off and there s noth to the do of them that leav a man to say that wa not done befor and it can not be done again,faulkner
1837,1838,so we did nt tell not even when after a while he d appear suddenli in the field besid us and go to work without have had time to get home and make out he had been in bed all night,he would tell ma that he had nt been hungri at breakfast or that he had eaten a piec of bread while he wa hitch up theteam,faulkner
1839,1840,but cash and i knew that he had nt been home at all on those night and he had come up out of the wood when we got to the field,but we did nt tell,faulkner
1841,1842,summer wa almost over then we knew that when the night began to get cool she would be done if he wa nt,but when fall came and the night began to get longer the onli differ wa that he would alway be in bed for pa to wake him get him up at last in that first state of semiidioci like when it first start wors than when he had stay out all night,faulkner
1843,1844,she s sure a stayer i told cash,i use to admir her but i downright respect her now,faulkner
1845,1846,it aint a woman he said,you know i said,faulkner
1847,1848,but he wa watch me,what is it then,faulkner
1849,1850,you can trail him through the wood all night if you want to i said,i m not,faulkner

1853,1854,i aint trail him he said,dont mean it that way,faulkner
1855,1856,and so a few night later i heard jewel get up and climb out the window and then i heard cash get up and follow him,the next morn when i went to the barn cash wa alreadi there the mule fed and he wa help dewey dell milk,faulkner
1857,1858,and when i saw him i knew that he knew what it wa,now and then i would catch him watch jewel with a queer look like have found out where jewel went and what he wa do had given him someth to realli think about at last,faulkner
1859,1860,but it wa not a worri look it wa the kind of look i would see on him when i would find him do some of jewel s work around the hous work that pa still thought jewel wa do and that ma thought dewey dell wa do,so i said noth to him believ that when he got done digest it in hi mind he would tell me,faulkner
1861,1862,but he never did,one morn it wa novemb then five month sinc it start jewel wa not in bed and he did nt join us in the field,faulkner
1863,1864,that wa the first time ma learn anyth about what had been go on,she sent vardaman down to find where jewel wa and after a while she came down too,faulkner
1865,1866,it wa as though so long as the deceit ran along quiet and monoton all of us let ourselv be deceiv abet it unawar or mayb through cowardic sinc all peopl are coward and natur prefer ani kind of treacheri becaus it ha a bland outsid,but now it wa like we had all and by a kind of telepath agreement of admit fear flung the whole thing back like cover on the bed and we all sit bolt upright in our naked stare at one anoth arid say now is the truth,faulkner
1867,1868,he ha nt come home,someth ha happen to him,faulkner
1869,1870,we let someth happen to him,then we saw him,faulkner

1873,1874,it wa a descend of those texa poni flem snope brought here twentyf year ago and auction off for two dollar a head and nobodi but old lon quick ever caught hi and still own some of the blood becaus he could never give it away,he gallop up and stop hi heel in the hors s rib and it danc and swirl like the shape of it mane and tail and the splotch of it coat had noth whatev to do with the fleshandbon hors insid them and he sat there look at us,faulkner

2399,2400,from here they do not appear to violat the surfac at all it is as though it had sever them both at a singl blow the two torso move with infinitesim and ludicr care upon the surfac,it look peac like machineri doe after you have watch it and listen to it for a long time,faulkner
2401,2402,as though the clot which is you had dissolv into the myriad origin motion and see and hear in themselv blind and deaf furi in itself quiet with stagnat,squat dewey dell s wet dress shape for the dead eye of three blind men those mammalian ludicros which are the horizon and the valley of the earth,faulkner
2403,2404,she lad never been pure religi not even after that summer at the camp meet when brother whitfield wrestl with her spirit singl her out and strove with the vaniti in her mortal heart and i said to her mani a time god gave you children to comfort your hard human lot and for a token of hi own suffer and love for in love you conceiv and bore them,i said that becaus she took god s love and her duti to him too much as a matter of cours and such conduct is not pleas to him,faulkner
2405,2406,i said he gave us the gift to rais our voic in hi undi prais becaus i said there is more rejoic in heaven over one sinner than over a hundr that never sin,and she said my daili life is an acknowledg and expiat of my sin and i said who are you to say what is sin and what is not sin,faulkner
2407,2408,it is the lord s part to judg our to prais hi merci and hi holi name in the hear of our fellow mortal becaus he alon can see into the heart and just becaus a woman s me is right in the sight of man she cant know if there is no sin in her heart without she open her heart to the lord and receiv hi grace,i said just becaus you have been a faith wife is no sign that there is no sin in your heart and just becaus your me is hard is no sign that the lord s grace is absolv you,faulkner
2409,2410,and she said i know my own sin,i know that i deserv my punish,faulkner
2411,2412,i do not begrudg it,and i said it is out of your vaniti that you would judg sin and salvat in the lord s place,faulkner
2413,2414,it is our mortal lot to suffer and to rais our voic in prais of him who judg the sin and offer the salvat through our trial and tribul time out of mind amen,not even after brother whitfield a godli man if ever one breath god s breath pray for you and strove as never a man could except him i said,faulkner
2415,2416,becaus it is not us that can judg our sin or know what is sin in the lord s eye,she ha had a hard me but so doe everi woman,faulkner
2417,2418,but you d think from the way she talk that she knew more about sin and salvat than the lord god himself than them who have strove and labor with the sin in thi human world,when the onli sin she ever commit wa be partial to jewel that never love her and wa it own punish in prefer to darl that wa touch by god himself and consid queer by us mortal and that did love her,faulkner
2419,2420,i said there is your sin,and your punish too,faulkner
2421,2422,jewel is your punish,but where is your salvat,faulkner
2423,2424,and life is short enough i said to win etern grace in,and god is a jealou god,faulkner
2425,2426,it is hi to judg and to mete not your,i know she said,faulkner
2427,2428,noth she said,he is my cross and he will be my salvat,faulkner
2429,2430,he will save me from the water and from the fire,even though i have laid down my life he will save me,faulkner
2431,2432,how do you know without you open your heart to him and lift your voic in hi prais,i said,faulkner
2433,2434,then i realis that she did not mean god,i realis that out of the vaniti of her heart she had spoken sacrileg,faulkner
2435,2436,and i went down on my knee right there,i beg her to kneel and open her heart and cast from ft the devil of vaniti and cast herself upon the merci of the lord,faulkner
2437,2438,but she would nt,she just sat there lost in her vaniti and her pride that had close her heart to god and set that selfish mortal boy in hi place,faulkner
2439,2440,kneel there i pray for her,i pray for that poor blind woman as i had never pray for me and mine,faulkner
2441,2442,it would he quiet there then with the water bubbl up and away and the sun slant quiet in the tree and the quiet smell of damp and rot leav and new earth especi in the earli spring for it wa worst then,i could just rememb how my father use to say that the reason for live wa to get readi to stay dead a long time and when i would have to look at them day after day each with hi and her secret and selfish thought and blood strang to each other blood and strang to mine and think that thi seem to be the onli way i could get readi to stay dead i would hate my father for have ever plant me,faulkner
2443,2444,i would look forward to the time when they fault so i could whip them,when the switch fell i could feel it upon my flesh when it welt and ridg it wa my blood that ran and i would think with each blow of the switch now you are awar of me now i am someth in your secret and selfish life who have mark your blood with my own for ever and ever,faulkner
2445,2446,and so i took ans,i saw him pass the school hous three or four time befor i learn that he wa drive four mile out of hi way to do it,faulkner
2447,2448,i notic then how he wa begin to hump a tall man and young so that he look alreadi like a tall bird hunch in the cold weather on the wagon seat he would pass the school hous the wagon creak slow hi head turn slow to watch the door of the school hous as the wagon pass until he went on around the curv and out of sight,one day i went to the door and stood there when he pass,faulkner
2449,2450,when he saw me he look quickli away and did not look back again,in the earli spring it wa worst,faulkner
2451,2452,sometim i thought that i could not bear it lie in bed at night with the wild gees go north and their honk come faint and high and wild out of the wild dark and dure the day it would seem as though i could nt wait for the last one to go so i could go down to the spring,i aint got none he said,faulkner
2453,2454,you have nt got ani,but you ve got a hous,faulkner
2455,2456,they tell me you ve got a hous and a good farm,and you live there alon do for yourself do you,faulkner
2457,2458,he just look at me turn the hat in hi hand,a new hous i said,faulkner
2459,2460,are you go to get marri,and he said again hold hi eye to mine that s what i come to see you about,faulkner
2461,2462,later he told me i aint got no peopl,so that wont be no worri to you,faulkner
2463,2464,i dont reckon you can say the same,no,faulkner
2465,2466,i have peopl,in jefferson,faulkner
2467,2468,hi face fell a littl,well i got a littl properti,faulkner
2469,2470,i m forehand i got a good honest name,i know how town folk are but mayb when they talk to me,faulkner
2471,2472,they might listen i said,but they ll be hard to talk to,faulkner
2473,2474,he wa watch my face,they re in the cemeteri,faulkner
2475,2476,but your live kin he said,they ll be differ,faulkner
2477,2478,will they,i said,faulkner
2479,2480,dont know,i never had ani other kind,faulkner
2481,2482,so i took ans,and when i knew that i had cash i knew that live wa terribl and that thi wa the answer to it,faulkner
2483,2484,that wa when i learn that word are no good that word dont ever fit even what they are tri to say at,when he wa born i knew that motherhood wa invent by someon who had to have a word for it becaus the one that had the children did nt care whether there wa a word for it or not,faulkner
2485,2486,i knew that fear wa invent by someon that had never had the fear pride who never had the pride,i knew that it had been not that they had dirti nose but that we had had to use one anoth by word like spider dangl by their mouth from a beam swing and twist and never touch and that onli through the blow of die switch could my blood and their blood flow as one stream,faulkner
2487,2488,i knew that it had,been not that my alon had to be violat over and over each day but that it had never been violat until cash came,faulkner
2489,2490,not even by ans in the night,he had a word too,faulkner
2491,2492,love he call it,but i had been use to word for a long time,faulkner
2493,2494,i knew that that word wa like the other just a shape to fill a lack that when the right time came you would nt need a word for that anymor than for pride or fear,cash did not need to say it to me nor i to him and i would say let ans use it if he want to,faulkner
2495,2496,so that it wa ans or love love or ans it did nt matter,i would think that even while i lay with him in the dark and cash asleep in the cradl within the swing of my hand,faulkner
2497,2498,i would think that if he were to wake and cri i would suckl him too,ans or love it did nt matter,faulkner
2499,2500,my alon had been violat and then made whole again by the violat time ans love what you will outsid the circl,then i found that i had darl at first i would not believ it,faulkner
2501,2502,then i believ that i would kill ans,it wa as though he had trick me hidden within a word like within a paper screen and struck me in the back through it,faulkner
2503,2504,but then i realis that i had been trick by word older than ans or love and that the same word had trick ans too and that my reveng would be that he would never know i wa take reveng,and when darl wa born i ask ans to promis to take me back to jefferson when i die becaus i knew that father had been right even when he could nt have known he wa right anymor than i could have known i wa wrong,faulkner
2505,2506,nonsens ans said you and me aint nigh done chap yet with just two,he did not know that he wa dead then a sometim i would lie by him in the dark hearingdi land that wa now of my blood and flesh and i would mink ans,faulkner
2507,2508,whi ans,whi are you ans,faulkner
2509,2510,i would think about hi name until after a while i could see the word as a shape a vessel and i would watch him liquefi and flow into it like cold molass flow out of the dark into the vessel until the jar stood full and motionless a signific shape profoundli without me like an empti door frame and then i would find that i had forgotten the name of the jar,i would think the shape of my bodi where i use to be a virgin is in the shape of a and i could nt think ans could nt rememb ans,faulkner
2511,2512,it wa not that i could think of myself as no longer unvirgin becaus i wa three now,and when i would think cash and darl that way until their name would die and solidifi into a shape and then fade away i would say all light,faulkner
2513,2514,it doe nt matter,it doe nt matter what they call them,faulkner
2515,2516,and so when cora tull would tell me i wa not a true mother i would think how word go straight up in a thin line quick and harmless and how terribl do goe along the earth cling to it so that after a while the two line are too far apart for the same person to straddl from one to the other and that sin and love and fear arejust sound that peopl who never sin nor love nor fear have for what they never had and can not have until they forget the word lake cora who could never even cook,i gave ans the children,faulkner
2517,2518,i did not ask for them,i did not even ask him for what he could have given me notans,faulkner
2519,2520,that wa my duti to him to not ask that and that duti i fulfil,i would be i i would let him be the shape and echo of hi word,faulkner
2521,2522,that wa more than he ask becaus he could not have ask for that and been ans use himself so with a word,and then he die,faulkner
2523,2524,he did not know he wa dead,i would lie by him in the dark hear the dark land talk of cod s love and hi beauti and hi sin hear the dark voiceless in which the word are the deed and the other word that are not deed that are just the gap in peopl lack come down like the cri of the gees out of the wild dark in the old terribl night fumbl at the deed like orphan to whom are point out in a crowd two face and told that is your father your mother,faulkner
2525,2526,i believ that i had found it,i believ that the reason wa the duti to the aliv to the terribl blood the red bitter flood boil through the land,faulkner
2527,2528,i would think of sin as i would think of the cloth we both wore in the world s face of the circumspect necessari becaus he wa he and i wa i the sin the more utter and terribl sinc he wa the instrument ordain by god who creat the sin to sanctifi that sin he had creat,while i wait for him in the wood wait for him befor he saw me i would think of him as dress in sin,faulkner
2529,2530,i would think of him as think of me as dress also in sin he the more beauti sinc the garment which he had exchang for sin wa sanctifi,i would think of the sin as garment which we would remov in order to shape and coerc the terribl blood to the forlorn echo of the dead word high in the air,faulkner
2531,2532,then i would lay with ans again i did not lie to him i just refus just as i refus my breast to cash and darl after their time wa up hear the dark land talk the voiceless speech,i hid noth,faulkner
2533,2534,i tri to deceiv no one,i would not have care,faulkner
2535,2536,i mere took the precaut that he thought necessari for hi sake not for my safeti but just as i wore cloth in the world s face,and i would think then when cora talk to me of how the high dead word in time seem to lose even the signific of their dead sound,faulkner
2537,2538,then it wa over,over in the sens that he wa gone and i knew that see him again though i would i would never again see him come swift and secret to me in the wood dress in sin like a gallant garment alreadi blow asid with the speed of hi secret come,faulkner
2539,2540,but for me it wa not over,i mean over in the sens of begin and end becaus to me there wa no begin nor end to anyth then,faulkner
2541,2542,i even held ans refrain still not that i wa hold him recession but as though noth els had ever been,my children were of me alon of the wild blood boil along the earth of me and of all that live of none and of all,faulkner
2543,2544,then i found that i had jewel,when i wake to rememb to discov it he wa two month gone,faulkner
2545,2546,my father said that the reason for live is get readi to stay dead i knew at last what he meant and that he could not have known what he meant himself becaus a man can not know anyth about clean up the hous afterward,and so i have clean my hous,faulkner
2547,2548,with jewel i lay by the lamp hold up my own head watch him cap and sutur it befor he breath the wild blood boil away and the sound of it ceas,then there wa onli the milk warm and calm and i lie calm in the slow silenc get readi to clean my hous,faulkner
2549,2550,i gave ans dewey dell to neg jewel,then i gave him vardaman to replac the child i had rob him of,faulkner
2551,2552,and now he ha three children that are hi and not mine,and then i could get readi to die,faulkner
2553,2554,one day i wa talk to cora,she pray for me becaus she believ i wa blind to sin want me to kneel and pray too becaus peopl to whom sin is just a matter of word to them salvat is just word too,faulkner
2555,2556,i woke to the enorm of my sin i saw the true light at last and i fell on my knee and confess to god and ask hi guidanc and receiv it,rise he said repair to that home in which you have put a live lie among those peopl with whom you have outrag my word confess your sin aloud,faulkner
2557,2558,it is for them for that deceiv husband to forgiv you not i,so i went,faulkner
2559,2560,i heard that tull s bridg wa gone i said thank o lord o mighti ruler of all for by those danger and difficulti which i should have to surmount i saw that he had not abandon me that my recept again into hi holi peac and love would be the sweeter for it,just let me not perish befor i have beg the forgiv of the man whom i betray i pray let me not be too late let not the tale of min and her transgress come from her lip instead of mine,faulkner
2561,2562,she had sworn then that she would never tell it but etern is a fearsom thing to face have i not wrestl thigh to thigh with satan myself,let me not have also the sin of her broken vow upon my soul,faulkner
2563,2564,let not the water of thi mighti wrath encompass me until i have cleans my soul in the presenc of them whom i injur,it wa hi hand that bore me safe abov the flood that fend from meth danger of the water,faulkner
2565,2566,my hors wa frighten and my own heart fail me as the log and the uproot tree bore down upon my littl,but not my soul time after time i saw them avert at destruct s final instant and i lift my voic abov the nois of the flood prais to thee o mighti lord and king,faulkner
2567,2568,by thi token shall i cleans my soul and gain again into the fold of thi undi love,i knew then that forgiv wa mine,faulkner
2569,2570,the flood the danger behind and as i rode on across the firm earth again and the scene of my gethseman drew closer and closer i frame the word which i should use,i would enter the hous i would stop her befor she had spoken i would say to her husband ans i have sin,faulkner
2571,2572,do with me as you will,it wa alreadi as though it were done,faulkner
2573,2574,my soul felt freer quieter than it had in year alreadi i seem to dwell in abid peac again as i rode on,to either side i saw hi hand in my heart i could hear hi voic courag,faulkner
2575,2576,i am with thee,then i reach tull s hous,faulkner
2577,2578,hi youngest girl came out and call to me as i wa pass,she told me that she wa alreadi dead,faulkner
2579,2580,i have sin o lord,thou knowest the extent of my remors and the will of my spirit,faulkner
2581,2582,but he is merci he will accept the will for the deed who knew mat when i frame the word of my confess it wa to ans i spoke them even though he wa not there,it wa he in hi infinit wisdom that restrain the tale from her die lip as she lay surround by those who love and trust her mine the travail by water which i sustain by the strength of hi hand,faulkner
2583,2584,prais to thee in thi bounteou and omnipot love prais,i enter the hous of bereav the lowli dwell where anoth er mortal lay while her soul face the aw and irrevoc judgment peac to her ash,faulkner

4053,4054,not he that i know of he never enter thi hous again after he and ellen marri,i wa young then i wa even young enough to believ that thi wa due to some stubborn coal of conscienc if not remors even in him,faulkner
4055,4056,but i know better now i know now that it wa simpli becaus sinc papa had given him respect through a wife there wa noth els he could want from papa and so not even sheer gratitud let alon appear could forc him to forgo hi own pleasur to the extent of take a famili meal with hi wife s peopl,so i saw littl of them,faulkner
4057,4058,i did not have time now to play even if i had ever had ani inclin,i had never learn how and i saw no reason to tri to learn now even if i had had the time,faulkner
4059,4060,so it wa six year now though it wa actual no secret to ellen sinc it had appar been go on ever sinc he drove the last nail in the hous the onli differ between now and the time of hi bachelorhood be that now they would hitch the team and saddl hors and mule in the grove beyond the stabl and so come up across the pastur unseen from the hous,becaus there were plenti of them still it wa as if god or the devil had taken advantag of hi veri vice in order to suppli wit to the discharg of our curs not onli from among gentlefolk our own kind but from the veri scum and riffraff who could not have approach the hous itself under ani other circumst not even from the rear,faulkner
4061,4062,ye ellen and those two children alon in that hous twelv mile from town and down there in the stabl a hollow squar of face in the lantern light the white face on three side the black one on the fourth and in the center two of hi wild negro fight nake fight not as white men fight with rule and weapon but as negro fight to hurt one anoth quick and bad ellen knew that or thought she did that wa not it,she accept reconcil though there is a breathingpoint in outrag where you can accept it almost with gratitud sinc you can say to yourself thank god thi is all at least i now know all of that cling still to that when she ran into the stabl that night while the veri men who had stolen into it from the rear fell back away from her with at least some grain of decenc and ellen see not the two black beast she had expect to see but instead a white one and a black one both nake to the waist and goug at one anoth s eye as if they should not onli have been the same color but should have been cover with fur too,faulkner
4063,4064,ye,it seem that on certain occas perhap at the end of the even the spectacl as a grand final or perhap as a matter of sheer deadli forethought toward the retent of supremaci domin he would enter the ring with one of the negro himself,faulkner
4065,4066,ye,i know you will excus us gentlemen ellen said,faulkner
4067,4068,but they were alreadi depart nigger and white slink out again as they had slunk in and ellen not watch them now either but kneel in the dirt while henri clung to her cri and he stand there yet while a third nigger prod hi shirt or coat at him as though the coat were a stick and he a cage snake,where is judith thoma,faulkner

4089,4090,time to come to bed,but i wa not there,faulkner
4091,4092,i wa not there to see the two sutpen face thi on judith and onc on the negro girl besid her look down through the squar entranc to the loft,the twilight wa full of it and of the smell of hi father s cigar as they sat on the front galleri after supper until it would be time for quentin to start while in the deep shaggi lawn below the veranda the firefli blew and drift in soft odor the scent which five month later mr compson s letter would carri up from mississippi and over the long iron new england snow and into quentin s sittingroom at harvard,faulkner
4093,4094,it wa a day of listen listen the hear in mostli about that which he alreadi knew sinc he had been born in and still breath the same air in which the church bell had rung on that sunday morn in and on sunday heard even one of the origin three bell in the same steepl where descend of the same pigeon strut and croon or wheel in short cours resembl soft fluid paintsmear on the soft summer sky,that sunday morn in june with the bell ring peac and peremptori and a littl denomin in concord though not in the ladi and children and hous negro to carri the parasol and flywhisk and even a few men the ladi move in hoop among the miniatur broadcloth of littl boy and the pantalett of littl girl in the skirt of the time when ladi did not walk but float when the other men sit with their feet on the rail of the holston hous galleri look up and there the stranger wa,faulkner
4095,4096,he wa alreadi halfway across the squar when they saw him on a big hardridden roan hors man and beast look as though they had been creat out of thin air and set down in the bright summer sabbath sunshin in the middl of a tire foxtrot face and hors that none of them had ever seen befor name that none of them had ever heard and origin and purpos which some of them were never to learn,so that in the next four week jefferson wa a villag then the holston hous the courthous six store a blacksmith and liveri stabl a saloon frequent by drover and peddler three church and perhap thirti resid the stranger s name went back and forth among the place of busi and of idl and among the resid in steadi stroph and antistroph sutpen,faulkner
4097,4098,sutpen,sutpen,faulkner
4099,4100,sutpen,that wa all that the town wa to know about him for almost a month,faulkner
4101,4102,he had appar come into town from the man of about twentyf as the town learn later becaus at the time hi age could not have been guess hi age could not have been guess becaus he look like a man who had been sick,not like a man who had been peac ill in bed and had recov to move with a sort of diffid and tent amaz in a world which he had believ himself on the point of surrend but like a man who had been through some solitari furnac experi which wa more than just fever like an explor ay who not onli had to face the normal hardship of the pursuit which he chose but wa overtaken by the ad and unforeseen handicap of the fever also and fought through it at enorm cost not so much physic as mental alon and unaid and not through blind instinct will to endur and surviv but to gain and keep to enjoy it the materi prize for which he accept the origin gambit,faulkner
4103,4104,a man with a big frame but gaunt now almost to emaci with a short reddish beard which resembl a disguis and abov which hi pale eye had a qualiti at onc visionari and alert ruthless and repos in a face whose flesh had the appear of potteri of have been color by that oven s fever either of soul or environ deeper than sun alon beneath a dead impervi surfac as of glaze clay,that wa what they saw though it wa year befor the town learn that that wa all which he possess at the strong spent hors and the cloth on hi back and a small saddlebag scarc larg enough to contain the spare linen and the razor and the two pistol of which miss coldfield told quentin with the butt worn smooth as pickhandl and which he use with the precis of knit needl later quentin s grandfath saw him ride at a canter around a sapl at twenti feet and put both bullet into a play card fasten to the tree,faulkner
4105,4106,he had a room in the holston hous but he carri the key with him and each morn he fed and saddl the hors and rode away befor daylight where to the town likewis fail to learn probabl due to the fact that he bore the pistol demonstr on the third day after hi arriv,so they had to depend on inquiri to find out what they told about him which would of necess be at night at the supper tabl in the holston hous diningroom or in the loung which he would have to cross to gain hi room and lock the door again which he would do as soon as he finish eat,faulkner
4107,4108,the bar open into the loung too and that would or should have been the place to accost him and even inquir except for the fact that he did not use the bar,he did not drink at all he told them,faulkner
4109,4110,he did not say that he use to drink and had quit nor that he had never use alcohol,so they would catch him run him to earth in the loung between the supper tabl and hi lock door to give him the opportun to tell them who he wa and where he came from and what he wa up to whereupon he would move gradual and steadili until hi back came in contact with post or a then stand there and tell them noth whatev as pleasantli and courteous as a hotel clerk,faulkner
4111,4112,it wa the chickasaw indian agent with or through whom he dealt and so it wa not until he wake the counti record that saturday night with the deed patent to the land and the gold spanish coin that the town learn that he now own a hundr squar mile of some of the best virgin bottom land in the countri though even that knowledg came too late becaus sutpen himself wa gone where to again they did not know,but he own land among them now and some of them began to suspect what gener compson appar knew that the spanish coin with which he had paid to have hi patent record wa the last one of ani kind which he possess,faulkner
4113,4114,so they were certain now that he had depart to get more there were sever who even anticip in believ and even in say aloud now that he wa not present what sutpen s futur and then unborn sisterinlaw wa to tell quentin almost eighti year later that he had found some uniqu and practic way of hide loot and that he had return to the cach to replenish hi pocket even if he had not actual ridden with the two pistol back to the river and the steamboat full of gambler and cotton and slavedeal to replenish the cach,at least some of them were tell one anoth that when two month later he return again without warn and accompani thi time by the cover wagon with a negro drive it and on the seat with the negro a small alertli resign man with a grim harri latin face in a frock coat and a flower waistcoat and a hat which would have creat no furor on a pari boulevard all of which he wa to wear constantli for the next two somberli theatric cloth and the express of fatalist and amaz hi white client and the negro crew which he wa to advis though not direct went stark nake save for a coat of dri mud,faulkner
4115,4116,thi wa the french architect,year later the town learn that he had come all the way from martiniqu on sutpen s bare promis and live for two year on venison cook over a campfir in an unfloor tent made of the wagon hood befor he so much as saw ani color or shape of pay,faulkner
4117,4118,and until he pass through town on hi way back to new orlean two year later he wa not even to see jefferson again he would not come or sutpen would not bring him to town even on the few occas when sutpen would be seen there and he did not have much chanc to look at jefferson on that first day becaus the wagon did not stop,appar it wa onli by sheer geograph hap that sutpen pass through town at all paus onli long enough for someon not gener compson to look beneath the wagon hood and into a black tunnel fill with still eyebal and smell like a wolfden,faulkner
4119,4120,but the legend of sutpen s wild negro wa not to begin at onc becaus the wagon went on as though even the wood and iron which compos it as well as the mule which drew it had becom imbu by sheer associ with him with that qualiti of gaunt and tireless drive that convict for hast and of flee time later sutpen told quentin s grandfath that on that afternoon when the wagon pass through jefferson they had been without food sinc the previou night and that he wa tri to reach sutpen s hundr and the river bottom to tri to kill a deer befor dark so he and the architect and the negro would not have to spend anoth night without food,so the legend of the wild men came gradual back to town brought by the men who would ride out to watch what wa go on who began to tell how sutpen would take stand besid a game trail with the pistol and send the negro in to drive the swamp like a pack of hound it wa they who told how dure that first summer and fall the negro did not even have or did not use blanket to sleep in even befor the coonhunt aker claim to have walk one of them out of the absolut mud like a sleep allig and scream just in time,faulkner
4121,4122,the negro could speak no english yet and doubtless there were more than aker who did not know that the languag in which they and sutpen commun wa a sort of french and not some dark and fatal tongu of their own,there were mani more than aker though the other were respons citizen and landown and so did not have to lurk about the camp at night,faulkner
4123,4124,in fact as miss coldfield told quentin they would make up parti to meet at the holston hous and go out horseback often carri lunch,sutpen had built a brick kiln and he had set up the saw and planer which he had brought in the capstan with a long sapl walkingbeam with the wagon team and the negro in shift and himself too when necessari when the machineri slow hitch to if the negro actual were wild men as gener compson told hi son quentin s father while the negro were work sutpen never rais hi voic at them that instead he led them caught them at the psycholog instant by exampl by some ascend of forbear rather than by brute fear,faulkner
4125,4126,without dismount usual sutpen did not even greet them with as much as a nod appar as unawar of their presenc as if they had been idl shade they would sit in a curiou quiet clump as though for mutual protect and watch hi mansion rise carri plank by plank and brick by brick out of the swamp where the clay and timber beard white man and the twenti black one and all stark nake beneath the croach and pervad mud,be men these spectat did not realiz that the garment which sutpen had worn when he first rode into jefferson were the onli one in which they had ever seen him and few of the women in the counti had seen him at all,faulkner
4127,4128,otherwis some of them would have anticip miss coldfield in thi too in divin that he wa save hi cloth sinc decorum even if not eleg of appear would be the onli weapon or rather ladder with which he could conduct the last assault upon what miss coldfield and perhap other believ to be respect that respect which accord to gener compson consist in sutpen s secret mind of a great deal more than the mere acquisit of a chatelain for hi hous,so he and the twenti negro work togeth plaster over with mud against the mosquito and as miss coldfield told quentin distinguish one from anoth by hi beard and eye alon and onli the architect resembl a human creatur becaus of the french cloth which he wore constantli with a sort of invinc fatal until the day after the hous wa complet save for the windowglass and the ironwar which they could not make by hand and the architect in the sun and heat of summer and the mud and ice of winter with quiet and unflag furi,faulkner
4129,4130,it took him two year he and hi crew of import slave which hi adopt fellow citizen still look on as be a good deal more deadli than ani beast he could have start and slain in that countri,they work from sunup to sundown while parti of horsemen rode up and sat their hors quietli and watch and the architect in hi formal coat and hi pari hat and hi express of grim and embitt amaz lurk about the environ of the scene with hi air someth between a casual and bitterli disinterest spectat and a condemn and conscienti gener compson said not at the other and what they were do so much as at himself at the inexplic and incred fact of hi own presenc,faulkner
4131,4132,but he wa a good architect quentin knew the hous twelv mile from jefferson in it grove of cedar and oak seventyf year after it wa finish,and not onli an architect as gener compson said but an artist sinc onli an artist could have born those two year in order to build a hous which he doubtless not onli expect but firmli intend never to see again,faulkner
4133,4134,not gener compson said the hardship to sens and the outrag to sensibl of the two year sojourn but sutpen that onli an artist could have born sutpen s ruthless and hurri and still manag to curb the dream of grim and castlelik magnific at which sutpen obvious aim sinc the place as sutpen plan it would have been almost as larg as jefferson itself at the time that the littl grim harri foreign had singlehand given battl to and vanquish sutpen s fierc and overween vaniti or desir for magnific or for vindic or whatev it wa even gener compson did not know yet and so creat of sutpen s veri defeat the victori which in conquer sutpen himself would have fail to gain,so it wa finish then down to the last plank and brick and wooden pin which they could make themselv,faulkner
4135,4136,unpaint and unfurnish without a pane of glass or a doorknob or hing in it twelv mile from town and almost that far from ani neighbor it stood for three year more surround by it formal garden and promenad it slave quarter and stabl and smokehous wild turkey rang within a mile of the hous and deer came light and color like smoke and left delic print in the formal bed where there would be no flower for four year yet,now there began a period a phase dure which the town and the counti watch him with more puzzlement yet,faulkner
4137,4138,perhap it wa becaus the next step toward that secret end which gener compson claim to have known but which the town and the counti comprehend but dimli or not at all now requir patienc or passiv time instead of that drive furi to which he had accustom them now it wa the women who first suspect what he want what the next step would be,none of the men certainli not those who knew him well enough to call him by name suspect that he want a wife,faulkner
4139,4140,doubtless there were some of them husband and bachelor both who not onli would have refus to entertain the idea but would even have protest against it becaus for the next three year he led what must have been to them a perfect exist,he live out there eight mile from ani neighbor in masculin solitud in what might be call the halfacr gunroom of a baroni splendor,faulkner
4141,4142,he live in the spartan shell of the largest edific in the counti not except the courthous itself whose threshold no woman had so much as seen without ani femin soft of windowpan or door or mattress where there wa not onli no woman to object if he should elect to have hi dog in to sleep on the pallet bed with him he did not even need dog to kill the game which left footprint within sight of the kitchen door but hunt it instead with human be who belong to him bodi and soul and of whom it wa believ or said that they could creep up to a bed buck and cut it throat befor it could move,it wa at thi time that he began to invit the parti of men of which miss coldfield told quentin out to sutpen s hundr to camp in blanket in the nake room of hi embryon formal opul they hunt and at night play card and drank and on occas he doubtless pit hi negro against one anoth and perhap even at thi time particip now and then himselfthat spectacl which accord to miss coldfield hi son wa unabl to bear the sight of while hi daughter look on unmov,faulkner
4143,4144,sutpen drank himself now though there were probabl other besid quentin s grandfath who remark that he drank veri sparingli save when he himself had manag to suppli some of the liquor,hi guest would bring whiskey out with them but he drank of thi with a sort of spare calcul as though keep mental gener compson said a sort of balanc of spiritu solvenc between the amount of whiskey he accept and the amount of run meat which he suppli to the gun,faulkner
4145,4146,he live like that for three year,he now had a plantat insid of two year he had drag hous and garden out of virgin swamp and plow and plant hi land with seed cotton which gener compson loan him,faulkner
4147,4148,then he seem to quit,he seem to just sit down in the middl of what he had almost finish and to remain so for three year dure which he did not even appear to intend or want anyth more,faulkner
4149,4150,perhap it is not to be wonder at that the men in the counti came to believ that the life he now led had been hi aim all the time it wa gener compson who seem to have known him well enough to offer to lend him seed cotton for hi start who knew ani better to whom sutpen ever told anyth about hi past,it wa gener compson who knew first about the spanish coin be hi last one as it wa compson so the town learn later who offer to lend sutpen the money to finish and furnish hi hous and wa refus,faulkner
4151,4152,so doubtless gener compson wa the first man in the counti to tell himself that sutpen did not need to borrow money with which to complet the hous suppli what it yet lack becaus he intend to marri,not the first person to know rather the first man sinc accord to what miss coldfield told quentin seventyf year later the women in the counti had been tell one anoth and their husband as well that sutpen did not intend to quit there that he had alreadi gone to too much troubl gone through too much privat and hardship to settl down and live exactli as he had live while the hous wa be built save that now he had a roof to sleep under in place of an unfloor wagon hood,faulkner
4153,4154,probabl the women had alreadi cast about among the famili of the men who might now be call hi friend for that prospect bride whose dowri might complet the shape and substanc of that respect miss coldfield anyway believ to be hi aim,so when at the expir of thi second phase three year after the hous wa finish and the architect depart and again on sunday morn and again without warn the town saw him cross the squar on foot now but in the same garment in which he had ridden into town five year ago and which no one had seen sinc he or one of the negro had iron the coat with heat brick gener compson told quentin s father and enter the methodist church onli some of the men were surpris,faulkner
4155,4156,the women mere said that he had exhaust the possibl of the famili of the men with whom he had hunt and gambl and that he had now come to town to find a wife exactli as he would have gone to the memphi market to buy livestock or slave,but when they comprehend whom it wa that he had appar come to town and into church to invest with hi choic the assur of the women becam one with the men s surpris and then even more than that amaz,faulkner
4157,4158,becaus the town now believ that it knew him,for two year it had watch him as with that grim and unflag furi he had erect that shell of a hous and laid out hi field then for three year he had remain complet static as if he were run by electr and someon had come along and remov dismantl the wire or the dynamo,faulkner
4159,4160,so that when he enter the methodist church that sunday morn in hi iron coat there were men as well as women who believ that they had onli to look around the congreg in order to anticip the direct hi feet would take him until they becam awar that he had appar mark down miss coldfield s father with the same cold and ruthless deliber with which he had probabl mark down the french architect,they watch in shock amaz while he laid deliber sieg to the one man in the town with whom he could have had noth in common least of all man who obvious could do noth under the sun for him save give him credit at a littl crossroad store or cast a vote in hi favor if he should ever seek ordin as a methodist methodist steward a merchant not onli of modest posit and circumst but who alreadi had a wife and famili of hi own let alon a depend mother and sister to support out of the proce of a busi which he had brought to jefferson ten year ago in a singl man with a name for absolut and undevi and even puritan upright in a countri and time of lawless opportun who neither drank nor gambl nor even hunt,faulkner
4161,4162,in their surpris they forgot that mr coldfield had a marriag daughter,they did not consid the daughter at all,faulkner
4163,4164,they did not think of love in connect with sutpen,they thought of ruthless rather than justic and of fear rather than respect but not of piti or love besid be too lost in amaz specul as to just how sutpen intend or could contriv to use mr coldfield to further whatev secret end he still had,faulkner
4165,4166,they were never to know even miss rosa coldfield did not,becaus from that day there were no more hunt parti out at sutpen s hundr and when they saw him now it would be in town,faulkner
4167,4168,but not loaf idl,the men who had slept and match glass with him under hi roof some of them had even come to call him sutpen without the formal mister watch him pass along the street befor the holston hous with a singl formal gestur to hi hat and go on and enter mr coldfield s store and that wa all,faulkner
4169,4170,then one day he quit jefferson for the second time mr compson told quentin,the town should have been accustom to that by now,faulkner
4171,4172,nevertheless hi posit had subtli chang as you will see by the town s reaction to thi second return,becaus when he came back thi time he wa in a sens a public enemi,faulkner
4173,4174,perhap thi wa becaus of what he brought back with him thi time the materi he brought back thi time as compar to the simpl wagonload of wild nigger which he had brought back befor,but i do nt think so,faulkner
4175,4176,that is i think it wa a littl more involv than the sheer valu of hi chandeli and mahogani and rug,i think that the affront wa born of the town s realiz that he wa get it involv with himself that whatev the feloni which produc the mahogani and crystal he wa forc the town to compound it,faulkner
4177,4178,heretofor until that sunday when he came to church if he had misus or injur anybodi it wa onli old ikkemotubb from whom he got hi matter between hi conscienc and uncl sam and god,but now hi posit had chang becaus when about three month after he depart four wagon left jefferson to go to the river and meet him it wa known that mr coldfield wa the man who hire and dispatch them,faulkner
4179,4180,they were big wagon drawn by oxen and when they return the town look at them and knew no matter what they might have contain that mr coldfield could not have mortgag everyth that he own for enough to fill them doubtless thi time there were more men than women even who pictur him dure thi absenc with a handkerchief over hi face and the two pistol barrel glint beneath the candelabra of a steamboat s saloon even if no wors if not someth perform in the lurk dark of a muddi land and with a knife from behind,they saw him pass on the roan hors besid hi four wagon it seem that even the one who had eaten hi food and shot hi game and even call him sutpen without the mister did nt accost him now,faulkner
4181,4182,they just wait while report and rumor came back to town of how he and hi now somewhat tame negro had instal the window and door and the spit and pot in the kitchen and the crystal chandeli in the parlor and the furnitur and the curtain and the rug it wa that same aker who had blunder onto the mudcouch negro five year ago who came a littl wildey and consider slackmouth into the holston hous bar one even and said boy thi time he stole the whole durn steamboat,so at last civic virtu came to a boil,faulkner
4183,4184,one day and with the sheriff of the counti among them a parti of eight or ten took the road out to sutpen s hundr,they did not go all the way becaus about six mile from town they met sutpen himself,faulkner
4185,4186,he wa ride the roan hors in the frock coat and the beaver hat which they knew and with hi leg wrap in a piec of tarpaulin he had a portmanteau on hi pommel and he wa carri a small woven basket on hi arm,he stop the roan it wa april then and the road wa still a quagmir and sat there in hi splash tarpaulin and look from one face to the next your grandfath said that hi eye look like piec of a broken plate and that hi beard wa strong as a currycomb,faulkner
4187,4188,that wa how he put it strong as a currycomb,good morn gentlemen he said,faulkner
4189,4190,were you look for me,doubtless someth more than thi transpir at the time though none of the vigil committe ever told it that i know of,faulkner
4191,4192,all i ever heard is how the town the men on the galleri of the holston hous saw sutpen and the committe ride onto the squar togeth sutpen a littl in front and the other bunch behind with hi leg and feet wrap neatli in hi tarpaulin and hi shoulder squar insid the worn broadcloth coat and that worn brush beaver cock a littl talk to them over hi shoulder and those eye hard and pale and reckless and probabl quizzic and mayb contemptu even then,he pull up at the door and the negro hostler duck out and took the roan s head and sutpen got down with hi portmanteau and the basket and mount the step and i heard how he turn there kind look at them again where they huddl on their hors not know what to do exactli,faulkner
4193,4194,and it might have been a good thing that he had that beard and they could not see hi mouth,then he turn and he look at the other men sit with their feet on the rail and watch him too men who use to come out to hi place and sleep on the floor and hunt with him and he salut them with that florid swagger gestur to the hat ye he wa underbr,faulkner
4195,4196,it show like thi alway your grandfath said in all hi formal contact with peopl,he wa like john l sullivan have taught himself pain and tedious to do the schottisch have drill himself and drill himself in secret until he now believ it no longer necessari to count the music s beat say,faulkner
4197,4198,he may have believ that your grandfath or judg benbow might have done it a littl more effortlessli than he but he would not have believ that anyon could have beat him in know when to do it and how,and besid it wa in hi face that wa where hi power lay your grandfath said that anyon could look at him and say given the occas and the need thi man can and will do anyth,faulkner
4199,4200,then he went on into the hous and command a chamber,so they sat on their hors and wait for him,faulkner
4201,4202,i suppos they knew that he would have to come out some time i suppos they sat there and thought about those two pistol,becaus there wa still no warrant for him you see it wa just public opinion in an acut state of indigest and now other horsemen rode into the squar and becam awar of the situat so that there wa quit a poss wait when he walk out onto the galleri,faulkner
4203,4204,he wore a new hat now and a new broadcloth coat so they knew what the portmanteau had contain,they even knew now what the basket had contain becaus he did not have that with him now either,faulkner
4205,4206,doubtless at the time it mere puzzl them more than ever becaus you see they had been too busi specul on just how he wa plan to use mr coldfield and sinc hi return too complet outrag by the belief that they now saw the result even if the mean were still an enigma to rememb about miss ellen at all,so he stop again doubtless and look from face to face again doubtless memor the new face without ani hast with still the beard to hide whatev hi mouth might have shown,faulkner
4207,4208,but he seem to have said noth at all thi time,he just descend the step and walk on across the squar the committe your grandfath said it had grown to almost fifti by now move too follow him across the squar,faulkner
4209,4210,they say he did not even look back,he just walk on erect with the new hat cock and carri in hi hand now that which must have seem to them the final gratuit insult with the committe ride along in the street besid him and not quit parallel and other who did not happen to have hors at the moment join in and follow the committe in the road and ladi and children and women slave come to the door and window of the home as they pass to watch as they went on in grim tableau and sutpen still without onc look back enter mr coldfield s gate and strode on up the brick walk to the door carri hi newspap cornucopia of flower,faulkner
4211,4212,they wait for him again,the crowd wa grow fast now other men and a few boy and even some negro from the adjac hous clot behind the eight origin member of the committe who sat watch mr coldfield s door until he emerg,faulkner
4213,4214,it wa a good while and he no longer carri the flower and when he return to the gate he wa engag to be marri,but they did not know thi and as soon as he reach the gate they arrest him,faulkner
4215,4216,they took him back to town with the ladi and children and hous nigger watch from behind curtain and behind the shrubberi in the yard and the corner of the hous the kitchen where doubtless food wa alreadi begin to scorch and so back to the squar where the rest of the ablebodi men left their offic and store to follow so that when he reach the courthous sutpen had a larger follow than if he actual had been the runaway slave,they arraign him befor a justic but by that time your grandfath and mr coldfield had got there,faulkner
4217,4218,they sign hi bond and late that afternoon he return home with mr coldfield walk along the same street as of the forenoon with doubtless the same face watch him from behind the window curtain to the betroth supper with no wine at tabl and no whiskey befor or after,dure none of hi three passag that day through that street did hi bear same unhurri stride to which that new frock coat swung the same angl to the new hat abov the eye and the beard,faulkner
4219,4220,your grandfath said that some of the faienc appear which the flesh of hi face had had when he came to town five year ago wa gone now and that hi face had an honest sunburn,and he wa not fleshier either your grandfath said that wa not it it wa just that the flesh on hi bone had becom quieter as though passiv after some actual breast of atmospher like in run so that he actual fill hi cloth now with that qualiti still swagger but without braggadocio or belliger though accord to your grandfath the qualiti had never been belliger onli watch,faulkner
4221,4222,and now that wa gone as though after the three year he could trust hi eye alon to do the watch without the flesh on hi bone stand sentri also,two month later he and miss ellen were marri,faulkner
4223,4224,it wa in june of almost five year to the day from that sunday morn when he rode into town on the roan hors,it the wed wa in the same methodist church where he saw ellen for the first time accord to miss rosa,faulkner
4225,4226,the aunt had even forc or nag not cajol that would not have done it mr coldfield into allow ellen to wear powder on her face for the occas,the powder wa to hide the mark of tear but befor the wed wa over the powder wa streak cake and channel,faulkner
4227,4228,ellen seem to have enter the church that night out of weep as though out of rain gone through the ceremoni and then walk back out of the church and into the weep again the tear again the same tear even the same rain,she got into the carriag and depart in it the rain for sutpen s hundr,faulkner
4229,4230,it wa the wed which caus the tear not marri sutpen,whatev tear there were for that grant there were tear came later,faulkner
4231,4232,it wa not intend to be a big wed,that is mr coldfield seem not to have intend it to be,faulkner
4233,4234,you will notic that most divorc occur with women who were marri by tobaccochew j p s in countri courthous or by minist wake after midnight with their suspend show beneath their coattail and no collar on and a wife or spinster sister in curl paper for wit,so is it too much to believ that these women come to long for divorc from a sens not of incomplet but of actual frustrat and betray,faulkner
4235,4236,that regardless of the breath evid of children and all els they still have in their mind the imag of themselv walk to music and turn head in all the symbol trap and circumst of ceremoni surrend of that which they no longer possess,and whi not sinc to them the actual and authent surrend can onli be and ha been a ceremoni like the break of a banknot to buy a ticket for the train,faulkner
4237,4238,of the two men it wa sutpen who desir the big wed the full church and all the rituali have thi from someth your grandfath let drop one day and which he doubtless had from sutpen himself in the same accident fashion sinc sutpen never even told ellen that he want it and the fact that at the last minut he refus to support her in her desir and insist upon it account partli for the tear,mr coldfield appar intend to use the church into which he had invest a certain amount of sacrific and doubtless selfdeni and certainli actual labor and money for the sake of what might be call a demand balanc of spiritu solvenc exactli as he would have use a cotton gin in which he consid himself to have incur either interest or respons for the gin of ani cotton which he or ani member of hi famili by blood or by marriag had and no more,faulkner
4239,4240,perhap hi want a small wed wa due to the same tediou and unremit husbandri which had enabl him to support mother and sister and marri and rais a famili on the proce of that store which ten year ago had fit into a singl wagon or perhap it wa some innat sens of delicaci and fit which hi sister and daughter did not seem to possess by the way regard the prospect soninlaw whom just two month ago he had been instrument in get out of jail,but it wa not due to ani lack of courag regard the soninlaw s still anomal posit in the town,faulkner
4241,4242,regardless of what their relat befor that had been and of what their futur relat might be if mr coldfield had believ sutpen guilti at the time of ani crime he would not have rais a finger to take sutpen out,he might not have gone out of hi way to keep sutpen in jail but doubtless the best possibl moral fumig which sutpen could have receiv at the time in the eye of hi fellow citizen wa the fact that mr coldfield sign hi bond someth he would not have done to save hi own good name even though the arrest had been a direct result of the busi between himself and sutpen that affair which when it reach a point where hi conscienc refus to sanction it he had withdrawn from and let sutpen take all the profit refus even to allow sutpen to reimburs him for the loss which in withdraw he had suffer though he did permit hi daughter to marri thi man of whose action hi conscienc did not approv,faulkner
4243,4244,thi wa the second time he did someth like that,when they were marri there were just ten peopl in the church includ the wed parti of the hundr who had been invit though when they emerg from the church it wa at night sutpen had brought in a halfdozen of hi wild negro to wait at the door with burn pine knot the rest of the hundr were there in the person of boy and youth and men from the drover tavern on the edg of trader and hostler and such who had not been invit,faulkner
4245,4246,that wa the other half of the reason for ellen s tear,it wa the aunt who persuad or cajol mr coldfield into the big wed,faulkner
4247,4248,but sutpen want it,he want not the anonym wife and the anonym children but the two name the stainless wife and the unimpeach fatherinlaw on the licens the patent,faulkner
4249,4250,ye patent with a gold seal and red ribbon too if that had been practic,but not for himself,faulkner
4251,4252,she miss rosa would have call the gold seal and the ribbon vaniti,but then so had vaniti conceiv that hous and built it in a strang place and with littl els but hi bare hand and further handicap by the chanc and probabl of meddl interfer aris out of the disapprob of all commun of men toward ani situat which they do not understand,faulkner
4253,4254,and pride miss rosa had admit that he wa brave perhap she even allow him pride the same pride which want such a hous which would accept noth less and drove through to get it at whatev cost,and then he live in it alon on a pallet on the floor for three year until he could furnish it as it should be the least of which furnitur wa that wed licens she wa quit right it wa not just shelter just anonym wife and children that he want just as he did not want just wed,faulkner
4255,4256,but when the femal crisi came when ellen and the aunt tri to enlist him on their side to persuad mr coldfield to the big wed he refus to support them,he doubtless rememb even better than mr coldfield that two month ago he had been in jail that public opinion which at some moment dure the five preced year had swallow him even though he never had quit ever lain quiet on it stomach and perform one of mankind s natur and violent and inexplic voltefac and regurgit him,faulkner
4257,4258,and it did not help him ani that at least two of the citizen who should have made two of the teeth in the outrag jaw serv instead as prop to hold the jaw open and impot while he walk out of it unharm,ellen and the aunt rememb thi too,faulkner
4259,4260,the aunt did,be a woman she wa doubtless one of that leagu of jefferson women who on the second day after the town saw him five year ago had agre never to forgiv him for not have ani past and who had remain consist,faulkner
4261,4262,sinc the marriag wa now a close incid she probabl look upon it as the one chanc not onli to secur her niec s futur as hi wife but to justifi the action of her brother in get him out of jail and her own posit as have appar sanction and permit the wed which in realiti she could not have prevent,it may have been for the sake of that big hous and the posit and state which the women realiz long befor the men did that he not onli aim at but wa go to attain,faulkner
4263,4264,or mayb women are even less complex than that and to them ani wed is better than no wed and a big wed with a villain prefer to a small one with a saint,so the aunt even use ellen s tear and sutpen who probabl knew about what wa go to happen becom as the time drew near graver and graver,faulkner
4265,4266,not concern just watch like he must have been from the day when he turn hi back upon all that he face and the he wa just fourteen then he told your grandfath set out into a world which even in theori he knew noth about and with a fix goal in hi mind which most men do not set up until the blood begin to slow at thirti or more and then onli becaus the imag repres peac and indol or at least a crown of vaniti,even then he had that same alert which he had to wear later day and night without chang or lay asid like the cloth which he had to sleep in as well as live in and in a countri and among a peopl whose veri languag he had to learn that unsleep care which must have known that it could permit itself but one mistak that alert for measur and weigh event against eventu circumst against human natur hi own fallibl judgement and mortal clay against not onli human but natur forc choos and discard compromis with hi dream and hi ambit like you must with the hors which you take across countri over timber which you control onli through your abil to keep the anim from realiz that actual you can not that actual it is the stronger,faulkner
4267,4268,hi wa the curiou posit now,he wa the solitari one,faulkner
4269,4270,not ellen,she not onli had the aunt to support her but the fact that women never plead nor claim loneli until impenetr and insurmount circumst forc them to give up all hope of attain the particular baubl which at the moment they happen to want,faulkner
4271,4272,and not mr coldfield,he had not onli public opinion but hi own disinclin for the big wed to support it without incongru or paradox,faulkner
4273,4274,then the tear won ellen and the aunt wrote out a hundr brought in one of the wild negro who carri them from door to door by even sent out a dozen more person one for the dress rehears when they reach the church for the rehears on the night befor the wed and found the church itself empti and a hand of men from the town s purlieu includ two of old ikkemotubb s chickasaw stand in the shadow outsid the door the tear came down again,ellen went through the rehears but afterward the aunt took her home in a state veri near hysteria though by the next day it had becom just quiet intermitt weep again,faulkner
4275,4276,there wa some talk even of put the wed off,i do nt know who it came from perhap from sutpen,faulkner
4277,4278,but i know who veto it,it wa as though the aunt were now bent no longer on mere thrust sutpen down the town s throat but thrust the wed itself,faulkner

4341,4342,the true reason for and begin of the relationship between mr coldfield and himself neither aunt ellen or miss rosa ever knew and sutpen wa to divulg to but one that under the pledg of confid as long as mr coldfield of regard for mr coldfield s care nurtur name for immacul which your grandfath said mr coldfield himself never divulg for the same reason,or perhap the reason wa that now sinc he had got out of hi fatherinlaw all that mr coldfield possess that sutpen could have use or want he had neither the courag to face hi fatherinlaw nor the grace and decenc to complet the ceremoni famili group even four time a year,faulkner
4343,4344,or perhap it wa the reason which sutpen gave himself and which the aunt refus to believ becaus of that veri fact that he did not get to town everi day and when he did he prefer to spend it he use the bar now with the men who gather each noon at the holston hous,that wa the face which when miss rosa saw it at all wa across hi own dine face of a foe who did not even know that it wa embattl,faulkner

4417,4418,she wa nt jealou of judith,it wa not selfpiti either sit there blink steadili at her sister while ellen talk in one of those botchedov hous dress the cloth castoff sometim but usual new which ellen gave her from time to time were alway silk of cours which the aunt had abandon when she elop with the horseand muletrad perhap in the hope or even the firm intent of never wear anyth like them again,faulkner
4419,4420,it wa probabl just peac despair and relief at final and complet abneg now that judith wa about to immol the frustrat s vicari recompens into the live fairi tale,it sound like a fairi tale when ellen told it later to your grandmoth onli it wa a fairi tale written for and act by a fashion ladi club,faulkner
4421,4422,but to miss rosa it must have been authent not onli plausibl but justifi henc the remark which sent ellen again she told thi too for the childish joke it wa into shriek of amus and fret astonish,we deserv him miss rosa said,faulkner
4423,4424,deserv,him,faulkner
4425,4426,ellen said probabl shriek too,of cours we deserv you want to put it that way,faulkner
4427,4428,i certainli hope and expect you to feel that the coldfield are qualifi to reciproc whatev particularli signal honor marriag with anyon might confer upon them,natur there is no known rejoind to thi,faulkner
4429,4430,at least as far as ellen ever told miss rosa did not tri to make one,she just saw ellen depart and then set about to make judith the second onli gift in her power,faulkner
4431,4432,she possess two now thi one likewis bequeath to her by the aunt who taught her both to keep hous and how to fit cloth by climb out a window one night though thi second gift develop late you might say repercuss due to the fact that when the aunt left miss rosa wa not yet larg enough to be abl to use the discard cloth even by cut the garment down,she set about secretli make garment for judith s trousseau,faulkner
4433,4434,she got the cloth from her father s store,she could not have got it anywher els,faulkner
4435,4436,your grandmoth told me that at that time miss rosa actual could not count money that she knew the progress of the coin in theori but that appar she had never had the actual cash to see touch experi and prove with that on certain day of the week she would go down town with a basket and shop at certain store which mr coldfield had alreadi design with no coin nor sum of money chang lip or hand and that later in the day mr coldfield would trace her cours by the debit scratch on paper or on wall and counter and pay them,so she would have to get the materi from him though hi stock which had begun as a collect of the crudest necess and which appar could not even feed himself and hi daughter from it own shelv had not increas let alon diversifi,faulkner
4437,4438,yet thi wa where she had to go to get the materi to make those intim young girl garment which were to be for her own vicari bridal and you can imagin too what miss rosa s notion of such garment would be let alon what her notion of them would look like when she had finish them unassist,nobodi know how she manag to get the materi from her father s store,faulkner
4439,4440,he did nt give it to her,he would have felt it incumb on him to suppli hi granddaught with cloth if she were indec clad or if she were rag or cold but not to marri in,faulkner
4441,4442,so i believ she stole it,she must have,faulkner
4443,4444,she must have taken it almost from under her father s nose it wa a small store and he wa hi own clerk and from ani point in it he could see ani other point with that amor bold that affin for brigandag in women but more like or so i would like to think by some subterfug of such bald and desper transpar concoct by innoc that it veri simplic fool him,so she did nt even see ellen anymor,faulkner
4445,4446,appar ellen had now serv her purpos complet the bright pointless noon and afternoon of the butterfli s summer and vanish perhap not out of jefferson but out of her sister s life ani way to be seen but the one time more die in bed in a darken room in the hous on which fate mischanc had alreadi laid it hand to the extent of scatter the black foundat on which it had been erect and remov it two male mainstay husband and one into the risk and danger of battl the other appar into oblivion,henri had just vanish,faulkner
4447,4448,she heard of that too while she wa spend her day and night she would have to wait until her father wa asleep sew tedious and without skill on the garment which she wa make for her niec s trousseau and which she had to keep hidden not onli from her father but from the two negress who might have told mr lace out of ravel and hoard string and thread and sew it onto garment while news came of lincoln s elect and of the fall of sumpter and she scarc listen hear and lose the knell and doom of her nativ land between two tediou and clumsi stitch on a garment which she would never wear and never remov for a man whom she wa not even to see aliv,henri just vanish she heard just what the town on thi next christma henri and bon came home again to spend the holiday the handsom and wealthi new orleansian whose engag to the daughter the mother had been fill the town s ear with for six month now,faulkner
4449,4450,they came again and now the town listen for the announc of the actual day,and then someth happen,faulkner
4451,4452,nobodi knew what whether someth between henri and bon on one hand and judith on the other or between the three young peopl on one hand and the parent on the other,but anyway when christma day came henri and bon were gone,faulkner
4453,4454,that s what miss rosa heard,nobodi know what she thought,faulkner
4455,4456,the town believ that henri s action wa just the fieri natur of youth let alon a sutpen and that time would cure it,doubtless sutpen s and judith s behavior toward one anoth and toward the town had someth to do with thi,faulkner
4457,4458,they would be seen togeth in the carriag in town now and then as though noth had occur between them at least which certainli would not have been the case if the quarrel had been between bon and the father and probabl not the case if the troubl had been between henri and hi father becaus the town knew that between henri and judith there had been a relationship closer than the tradit loyalti of brother and sister even a curiou relationship someth of that fierc imperson rivalri between two cadet in a crack regiment who eat from the same dish and sleep under the same blanket and chanc the same destruct and who would risk death for one anoth not for the other s sake but for the sake of the unbroken front of the regiment itself,that s all miss rosa knew,faulkner
4459,4460,she could have known no more about it than the town knew becaus the one who did know sutpen or judith not ellen who would have been told noth in the first place and would have forgot fail to assimil it if she had been told ellen the butterfli from beneath whom without warn the veri sunbuoy air had been withdrawn leav her now with the plump hand fold on the coverlet in the darken room and the eye abov them probabl not even suffer but mere fill with baffl incomprehens would not have told her anymor than they would have told anyon in jefferson or anywher els,miss rosa probabl went out there probabl onc and then no more,faulkner
4461,4462,and she must have told mr coldfield that there wa noth wrong and evid she believ that herself sinc she continu to sew on the garment for judith s wed,she wa still do that when mississippi seced and when the first confeder uniform began to appear in jefferson where colonel sartori and sutpen were rais the regiment which depart in with sutpen second in command side at colonel sartori left hand on the black stallion name out of scott beneath the regiment color which he and sartori had design and which sartori womenfolk had sew togeth out of silk dress,faulkner
4463,4464,he had fill out physic from what he had been not onli when he first rode into jefferson that sunday in but from what he had been when he and ellen marri,he wa not portli yet though he wa now get on toward fiftyf,faulkner
4465,4466,the fat the stomach came later,it came upon him suddenli all at onc in the year after whatev it wa happen to hi engag to miss rosa and she quit hi roof and return to town to live alon in her father s hous and did not ever speak to him again except when she address him that one time when they told her that he wa dead,faulkner
4467,4468,the flesh came upon him suddenli as though what the negro and wash jone too call the fine figur of a man had reach and held it peak after the foundat had given away and someth between the shape of him that peopl knew and the uncompromis skeleton of what he actual wa had gone fluid and earthbound had been snub up and restrain balloonlik unstabl and lifeless by the envelop which it had betray,she did not see the regiment depart becaus her father forbad her to leav the hous until it wa gone refus to allow her to take part in or be present with the other women and girl in the ceremoni of it departur though not becaus hi soninlaw happen to be in it,faulkner
4469,4470,he had never been an irasc man and befor war wa actual declar and mississippi seced hi act and speech of protest had been not onli calm but logic and quit sensibl,but after the die wa cast he seem to chang overnight just as hi daughter ellen chang her natur a few year befor,faulkner
4471,4472,as soon as troop began to appear in jefferson he close hi store and kept it close all dure the period that soldier were be mobil and drill and later after the regiment wa gone whenev casual troop would bivouac for the night in pass refus to sell ani good for ani price to the militari and so it wa told to the famili not onli of soldier but of men or women who had support secess and war onli in talk opinion,he refus to permit hi sister to come back home to live while her horsetrad husband wa in the armi he would not even allow miss rosa to look out the window at pass soldier,faulkner
4473,4474,he had close hi store perman and wa at home all day now,he and miss rosa live in the back of the hous with the front door lock and the front shutter close and fasten,faulkner
4475,4476,then one morn he learn that hi store had been broken into and loot doubtless by a compani of strang troop bivouack on the edg of town and doubtless abet if onli vocal by hi own fellow citizen,that night he mount to the attic with hi hammer and hi hand of nail and nail the door behind him and threw the hammer out the window,faulkner
4477,4478,he wa not a coward,he wa a man of uncompromis moral strength come into a new countri with a small stock of good and support five peopl out of it in comfort and secur at least,faulkner
4479,4480,he did it by close trade to be sure he could not have done it save by close trade or dishonesti and as your grandfath said a man who in a countri such as mississippi wa then would restrict dishonesti to the sell of straw hat and hame string and salt meat would have been alreadi lock up by hi own famili as a kleptomaniac,but he wa not a coward even though hi conscienc may have object as your grandfath said not so much to the idea of pour out human blood and life but at the idea of wast of wear out and eat up and shoot away materi in ani caus whatev,faulkner
4481,4482,now miss rosa s life consist of keep life in herself and her father,up to the night when it wa loot they had live out of the store,faulkner
4483,4484,she would go to the store after dark with a basket and fetch back enough food to last for a day or two,so the stock not renew for some time befor that wa consider reduc even befor the loot and soon she who had never been taught to do anyth practic becaus the aunt had rais her to believ that she wa not onli delic but actual preciou wa cook the food which as time pass becam harder and harder to come by and poorer and poorer in qualiti and haul it up to her father at night by mean of a well pulley and rope attach to the attic window,faulkner
4485,4486,she did thi for three year feed in secret and at night and with food which in quantiti wa scarc suffici for one the man whom she hate,and she may not have known befor that she hate him and she may not have known it now even nevertheless the first of the ode to southern soldier in that portfolio which when your grandfath saw it in contain a thousand or more wa date in the first year of her father s voluntari incarcer and date at two oclock in the morn,faulkner
4487,4488,then he die,one morn the hand did not come out to draw up the basket,faulkner
4489,4490,the old nail were still in the door and neighbor help her break it in with axe and they found him who had seen hi sole mean of support loot by the defend of hi caus even if he had repudi it and them with three day uneaten food besid hi pallet bed as if he had spent the three day in a mental balanc of hi terrestri account found the result and prove it and then turn upon hi contemporari scene of folli and outrag and injustic the dead and consist impass of a cold and inflex disapprov,now miss rosa wa not onli an orphan but a pauper too,faulkner
4491,4492,the store wa just a shell the desert build vacat even by rat and contain noth not even goodwil sinc he had irrevoc estrang himself from neighbor town and embattl land all three by hi behavior,even the two negress were gone he had freed as soon as he came into possess of them through a debt by the way not purchas write out their paper of freedom which they could not read and put them on a weekli wage which he held back in full against the discharg of their current market in return for which they had been among the first jefferson negro to desert and follow the yanke troop,faulkner
4493,4494,so when he die he had noth not onli save but kept,doubtless the onli pleasur which he had ever had wa not in the meager spartan hoard which he had accumul befor hi path cross that of hi futur in the money but in it represent of a balanc in whatev spiritu countinghous he believ would some day pay hi sight draft on selfdeni and fortitud,faulkner
4495,4496,and doubtless what hurt him most in the whole busi with sutpen wa not the loss of the money but the fact that he had had to sacrific the hoard the symbol of the fortitud and abneg to keep intact the spiritu solvenc which he believ that he had alreadi establish and secur,it wa as if he had had to pay the same note twice becaus of some trifl oversight of date or signatur,faulkner
4497,4498,so miss rosa wa both pauper and orphan with no kin abov dust but judith and the aunt who had been last heard of two year ago while tri to pass the yanke line to reach illinoi and so be near the rock island prison where her husband who had offer hi talent for muleget to the confeder cavalri remount corp and had been caught at it now wa,ellen wa dead two year now the butterfli the moth caught in a gale and blown against a wall and cling there beat feebli not with ani particular stubborn cling to life not in particular pain sinc it wa too light to have struck hard nor even with veri much remembr of the bright vacuum befor the gale but just in bewild and uncomprehend amaz the bright trivial shell not even chang to ani great extent despit the year of bad food sinc all of sutpen s negro had desert also to follow the yanke troop away the wild blood which he had brought into the countri and tri to mix blend with the tame which wa alreadi there with the same care and for the same purpos which he blend that of the stallion and that of hi own,faulkner
4499,4500,and with the same success as though hi presenc alon compel that hous to accept and retain human life as though hous actual possess a sentienc a person and charact acquir not so much from the peopl who breath or have breath in them inher in the wood and brick or begotten upon the wood and brick by the man or men who conceiv and built thi hous an incontrovert affirm for empti desert an insurmount resist to occup save when sanction and protect by the ruthless and the strong,ellen had lost some flesh of cours but it wa as the butterfli itself enter dissolut by actual dissolv the area of wing and bodi decreas a littl the pattern of the spot draw a littl closer togeth but with no wrinkl to same smooth almost girlish face on the pillow though miss rosa now discov that ellen had been dye her hair evid for year the same almost plump soft though now unring hand on the coverlet and onli the bafflement in the dark uncomprehend eye to indic anyth of present life by which to postul approach death as she ask the seventeenyearold sister to protect the remain child,faulkner
4501,4502,henri up to now wa just vanish hi birthright voluntarili repudi he had not yet return to play hi final part in hi famili s thi your grandfath said spare ellen too not that it would have been the crush and crown blow but that it would have been wast on her sinc the cling moth even aliv would have been incap now of feel anymor of wind or violenc,so the natur thing would have been for her to go out and live with judith the natur thing for her or ani southern woman gentlewoman,faulkner
4503,4504,she would not have need to be ask no one would expect her to wait to be,becaus that s what a southern ladi is,faulkner
4505,4506,that s what she would have been expect to do,but she did nt,faulkner
4507,4508,yet judith still had those abandon acr to draw from let alon clyti to help her keep her compani and wash jone to feed her as wash had fed ellen befor she die,but miss rosa did nt go out there at onc,faulkner
4509,4510,perhap she never would have gone,although ellen had ask her to protect judith possibl she felt that judith did not need protect yet sinc if even defer love could have suppli her with the will to exist endur for thi long then that same love even though defer must and would preserv bon until the folli of men would stalem from sheer exhaust and he would return from wherev he wa and bring henri with victim too of the same folli and mischanc,faulkner
4511,4512,she must have seen judith now and then and judith probabl urg her to come out to sutpen s hundr to live but i believ that thi is the reason she did not go even though she did not know where bon and henri were and judith appar never thought to tell her,becaus judith knew,faulkner
4513,4514,she may have known for some time even ellen may have known,or perhap judith never told her mother either,faulkner
4515,4516,perhap ellen did not know befor she die that henri and bon were now privat in the compani which their classmat at the univers had organ,the first intim miss rosa had had in four year that her nephew wa still aliv wa the afternoon when wash jone ride sutpen s remain mule stop in front of the hous and began to shout her name,faulkner
4517,4518,she had seen him befor but she did not recogn gaunt gangl man malariaridden with pale eye and a face that might have been ani age between twentyf and sixti sit on the saddleless mule in the street befor the gate shout hello hello at interv until she came to the door whereupon he lower hi voic somewhat though not much,air you rosi coldfield,faulkner
4519,4520,he said,quentin knew that,faulkner
4521,4522,he could almost see her wait in one of the dark airless room in the littl grim hous s impregn solitud,she would have no light burn becaus she would be out of the hous soon and probabl some mental descend or kinsman of him or her who had told her onc that light and move air carri heat had also told her that the cost of electr wa not in the actual time the light burn but in the retroact overcom of primari inertia when the switch wa snap that that wa what show on the meter,faulkner
4523,4524,she would be wear alreadi the black bonnet with jet sequin he knew that and a shawl sit there in the augment and defunct twilight she would have even now in her hand or on her lap the reticul with all the key entranc closet and cupboard that the hous possess which she wa about to desert for perhap six hour and a parasol an umbrella too he thought think how she would be impervi to weather and season sinc although he had not spoken a hundr word to her in hi life befor thi afternoon he did know that she had never befor tonight quit that hous after sundown save on sunday and wednesday for prayer meet in the entir fortythre year probabl,ye she would have the umbrella,faulkner
4525,4526,she would emerg with it when he call for her and carri it invinc into the spent suspir of an even without even dew where even now the onli alter toward dark wa in the soft and fuller random of the firefli below the galleri where he rose from hi chair as mr compson carri the letter emerg from the hous snap on the porch light as he pass,you will probabl have to go insid to read it mr compson said,faulkner
4527,4528,mayb i can read it here all right quentin said,perhap you are right mr compson said,faulkner
4529,4530,mayb even the light of day let alon he indic the singl globe stain and bugfoul from the long summer and which even when clean gave off but littl be too much for it for them,ye for them of that day and time of a dead time peopl too as we are and victim too as we are but victim of a differ circumst simpler and therefor integ for integ larger more heroic and the figur therefor more heroic too not dwarf and involv but distinct uncomplex who had the gift of love onc or die onc instead of be diffus and scatter creatur drawn blindli limb from limb from a grab bag and assembl author and victim too of a thousand homicid and a thousand copul and divorc,faulkner
4531,4532,perhap you are right,perhap ani more light than thi would be too much for it but he did not give quentin the letter at onc,faulkner
4533,4534,he sat again quentin sit again too and took up the cigar from the veranda rail the coal glow again the wistaria color smoke drift again unwind across quentin s face as mr compson rais hi feet onc more to the rail the letter in hi hand and the hand look almost as dark as a negro s against hi linen leg,becaus henri love bon,faulkner
4535,4536,he repudi blood birthright and materi secur for hi sake for the sake of thi man who wa at least an intend bigamist even if not an out and out blackguard and on whose dead bodi four year later judith wa to find the photograph of the other woman and the child,so much so that he henri could give hi father the lie about a statement which he must have realiz that hi father could not and would not have made without foundat and proof,faulkner
4537,4538,yet he did it henri himself strike the blow with hi own hand even though he must have known that what hi father told him about the woman and the child wa true,he must have said to himself must have said when he close the librari door for the last time behind himself that christma eve and must have repeat while he and bon rode side by side through the iron dark of that christma morn away from the hous where he had been born and which he would see but one time more and that with the fresh blood of the man who now rode besid him on hi hand i will believ i will,faulkner
4539,4540,i will,even if it is so even if what my father told me is true and which in spite of myself i can not keep from know is true i will still believ,faulkner
4541,4542,becaus what els could he have hope to find in new orlean if not the truth,but who know whi a man though suffer cling abov all the other well member to the arm or leg which he know must come off,faulkner
4543,4544,becaus he love bon,i can imagin him and sutpen in the librari that christma eve the father and the brother percuss and repercuss like a thunderclap and it echo and as close togeth the statement and the give of the lie the decis instantan and irrevoc between father and friend between so henri must have believ that where honor and love lay and thi where blood and profit ran even though at the instant of give the lie he knew that it wa the truth,faulkner
4545,4546,that wa whi the four year the probat,he must have known that it would be vain even then on that christma eve not to speak of what he learn saw with hi own eye in new orlean,faulkner
4547,4548,he may even have known bon that well by then who had not chang until then and so would in all probabl not chang later and he henri who could not say to hi friend i did that for love of you do thi for love of me,he could nt say that you see thi man thi youth scarc twenti who had turn hi back upon all that he knew to cast hi lot with the singl friend whom even as they rode away that night he must have known as he knew that what hi father had told him wa true that he wa doom and destin to kill,faulkner
4549,4550,he must have known that just as he knew that hi hope wa vain what hope and what for he could not have said what hope and dream of chang in bon or in the situat what dream that he could someday wake from and find it had been a dream as in the injur man s fever dream the dear suffer arm or leg is strong and sound and onli the well one sick,it wa henri s probat henri hold all three of them in that duranc to which even judith acquiesc up to a certain point,faulkner
4551,4552,she did not know what happen in the librari that night,and bon henri would have no more told bon what hi father had told him than he would have return to hi father and told him that bon deni it sinc to do one he would have to do the other and he knew that bon s denial would be a lie and though he could have born bon s lie himself he could not have born for either judith or hi father to hear it,faulkner
4553,4554,besid henri would not need to tell bon what had happen,bon must have learn of sutpen s visit to new orlean as soon as he bon reach home that first summer,faulkner
4555,4556,he must have known that sutpen now knew hi bon until he saw sutpen s reaction to it ever look upon it as a caus for secreci certainli not as a valid object to marriag with a white situat in which probabl all hi contemporari who could afford it were likewis involv and which it would no more have occur to him to mention to hi bride or wife or to her famili than he would have told them the secret of a fratern organ which he had join befor he marri,in fact the manner in which hi intend bride s famili react to the discoveri of it wa doubtless the first and last time when the sutpen famili ever surpris him,faulkner
4557,4558,he is the curiou one to me,he came into that isol puritan countri household almost like sutpen himself came into jefferson appar complet without background or past or man a littl older than hi actual year and enclos and surround by a sort of scythian glitter who seem to have seduc the countri brother and sister without ani effort or particular desir to do so who caus all the pother and uproar yet from the moment when he realiz that sutpen wa go to prevent the marriag if he could he bon seem to have withdrawn into a mere spectat passiv a littl sardon and complet enigmat,faulkner
4559,4560,he seem to hover shadowi almost substanceless a littl behind and abov all the other straightforward and logic even though to him incomprehens ultimatum and affirm and defianc and challeng and repudi with an air of sardon and indol detach like that of a youth roman consul make the grand tour of hi day among the barbarian hord which hi grandfath conquer benight in a brawl and childish and quit deadli mudcastl household in a miasmic and spiritridden forest,it wa as if he found the whole busi not inexplic of cours just unnecessari that he knew at onc that sutpen had found out about the mistress and child and he now found sutpen s action and henri s reaction a fetishridden moral blunder which did not deserv to be call think and which he contempl with the detach attent of a scientist watch the muscl in an anesthet contempl them from behind that barrier of sophist in comparison with which henri and sutpen were troglodyt,faulkner
4561,4562,not just the outsid the way he walk and talk and wore hi cloth and hand ellen into the diningroom or into the carriag and perhap probabl kiss her hand and which ellen envi for henri but the man fatalist and impenetr imperturb with which he watch them while he wait for them to do whatev it would be that they would do as if he had known all the while that the occas would aris when he would have to wait and that all he would need to do would be to wait had known that he had seduc henri and judith both too thoroughli to have ani fear that he might not marri judith when he wish to,not that stupid shrewd part instinct and part belief in luck and part muscular habit of the sens and nerv of the gambler wait to take what he can from what he see but a certain reserv and inflex pessim strip long gener ago of all the rubbish and claptrap of peopl ye sutpen and henri and the coldfield too who have not quit emerg from barbar who two thousand year henc will still be throw triumphantli off the yoke of latin cultur and intellig of which they were never in ani great perman danger to begin with,faulkner
4563,4564,becaus he love judith,he would have ad doubtless after hi fashion sinc as hi intend fatherinlaw soon learn thi wa not the first time he had play thi part pledg what he had pledg to judith let alon the first time he would have gone through a ceremoni to commemor it make what distinct he wa a cathol of sort he might between thi one with a white woman and that other,faulkner
4565,4566,becaus you will see the letter not the first one he ever wrote to her but at least the first the onli one she ever show as your grandmoth knew then and so we believ now that she is dead the onli one which she kept unless of cours miss rosa or clyti destroy the other after she herself die and thi one here preserv not becaus judith put it away to keep but becaus she brought it herself and gave it to your grandmoth after bon s death possibl on the same day when she destroy the other which he had written her provid of cours it wa she herself who destroy them which would have been when she found in bon s coat the pictur of the octoroon mistress and the littl boy,becaus he wa her first and last sweetheart,faulkner
4567,4568,she must have seen him in fact with exactli the same eye that henri saw him with,so that he must have appear not onli to henri but to the entir undergradu bodi of that small new provinci colleg as a sourc not of envi becaus you onli envi whom you believ to be but for accid in no way superior to yourself and what you believ grant a littl better luck than you have had heretofor you will someday possess not of envi but of despair that sharp shock terribl hopeless despair of the young which sometim take the form of insult toward and even physic assault upon the human subject of it or in extrem case like henri s insult toward and assault upon ani and all detractor of the subject as wit henri s violent repudi of hi father and hi birthright when sutpen forbad the marriag,faulkner
4569,4570,ye he love bon who seduc him as sure as he seduc judith the countri boy born and bred who with the five or six other of that small undergradu bodi compos of other planter son whom bon permit to becom intim with him who ape hi cloth and manner and to the extent which they were abl hi veri manner of live look upon bon as though he were a hero out of some adolesc arabian night who had stumbl upon a talisman or touchston not to invest him with wisdom or power or wealth but with the abil and opportun to pass from the scene of one scarc imagin delight to the next one without interv or paus or satieti,and the veri fact that loung befor them in the outlandish and almost feminin garment of hi sybarit privaci the profess satieti onli increas the amaz and the bitter and hopeless outrag,faulkner
4571,4572,henri wa the provinci the clown almost given to instinct and violent action rather than to think who may have been consciou that hi fierc provinci s pride in hi sister s virgin wa a fals quantiti which must incorpor in itself an inabl to endur in order to be preciou to exist and so must depend upon it loss absenc to have exist at all,in fact perhap thi is the pure and perfect incest the brother realiz that the sister s virgin must be destroy in order to have exist at all take that virgin in the person of the brotherinlaw the man whom he would be if he could becom metamorphos into the lover the husband by whom he would be despoil choos for despoil if he could becom metamorphos into the sister the mistress the bride,faulkner
4573,4574,perhap that is what went on not in henri s mind but in hi soul,becaus he never thought,faulkner
4575,4576,he felt and act immedi,ye it wa henri who seduc judith not bon as wit the entir queerli placid cours of bon s and judith s engag if engag it ever wa last for a whole year yet compris two holiday visit as her brother s guest which bon seem to have spent either in ride and hunt with henri or as act as an eleg and indol esoter hothous bloom possess mere the name of a citi for origin histori and past about which ellen preen and flutter out her unwit butterfli s indian summer he the live man wa usurp you see,faulkner
4577,4578,there wa no time no interv no nich in the crowd day when he could have court judith,you can not even imagin him and judith alon togeth,faulkner
4579,4580,there doe not even seem to have been ani courtship,appar he paid judith the dubiou compliment of not even tri to ruin her let alon insist on the marriag either befor or after sutpen forbad mind you in a man who had alreadi acquir a name for prowess among women while at the univers long befor sutpen wa to find actual proof,faulkner
4581,4582,no engag no courtship even he and judith saw one anoth three time in two year for a total period of seventeen day count the time which ellen consum they part without even say goodby,and yet four year later henri had to kill bon to keep them from marri,faulkner
4583,4584,so it must have been henri who seduc judith not bon seduc her along with himself from that distanc between oxford and sutpen s hundr between herself and the man whom she had not even seen yet as though by mean of that telepathi with which as children they seem at time to anticip one anoth action as two bird leav a limb at the same instant that rapport not like the convent delus of that between twin but rather such as might exist between two peopl who regardless of sex or age or heritag of race or tongu had been maroon at birth on a desert island the island here sutpen s hundr the solitud the shadow of that father with whom not onli the town but their mother s famili as well had mere assum armistic rather than accept and assimil,you see,faulkner
4585,4586,ye grant that even to the unworldli henri let alon the more travel father the exist of the eighth part negro mistress and the sixteenth part negro son grant even the morganat situat which wa as much a part of a wealthi young new orleansian s social and fashion equip as hi danc slipper wa reason enough which is draw honor a littl fine even for the shadowi paragon which are our ancestor born in the south and come to womanhood about eighteen sixti or sixti one,it s just incred,faulkner
4587,4588,it just doe not explain,or perhap that s it they do nt explain and we are not suppos to know,faulkner
4589,4590,we have a few old mouthtomouth tale we exhum from old trunk and box and drawer letter without salut or signatur in which men and women who onc live and breath are now mere initi or nicknam out of some now incomprehens affect which sound to us like sanskrit or chocktaw we see dimli peopl the peopl in whose live blood and seed we ourselv lay dormant and wait in thi shadowi attenu of time possess now heroic proport perform their act of simpl passion and simpl violenc impervi to time and inexplic ye judith bon henri sutpen all of them,they are there yet someth is miss they are like a chemic formula exhum along with the letter from that forgotten chest care the paper old and fade and fall to piec the write fade almost indecipher yet meaning familiar in shape and sens the name and presenc of volatil and sentient forc you bring them togeth in the proport call for but noth happen you reread tediou and intent pore make sure that you have forgotten noth made no miscalcul you bring them togeth again and again noth happen just the word the symbol the shape themselv shadowi inscrut and seren against that turgid background of a horribl and bloodi mischanc of human affair,faulkner
4591,4592,bon and henri came from the univers to spend that first christma,judith and ellen and sutpen saw him for the first the man whom she wa to see for an elaps time of twelv day yet to rememb so that four year later he never wrote her dure that time,faulkner
4593,4594,you see,you would almost believ that sutpen s trip to new orlean wa just sheer chanc just a littl more of the illog machin of a fatal which had chosen that famili in prefer to ani other in the counti or the land exactli as a small boy choos one anthil to pour boil water into in prefer to ani other not even himself know whi,faulkner
4595,4596,bon and henri stay two week and rode back to school stop to see miss rosa but she wa not at home they pass the long term befor the summer vacat talk togeth and ride and read bon wa read law,he would be would almost have to sinc onli that could have made hi resid bearabl regardless of what reason he may have brought with him for remain thi the perfect set for hi dilatori indol thi dig into musti blackston and coke where of an undergradu bodi still number in two figur the law school probabl consist of six other besid henri and he corrupt henri to the law also henri chang in midterm while henri ape hi cloth and speech caricatur rather perhap,faulkner
4597,4598,there wa no one for him to tell talk to about hi fear and suspicion,he trust no man nor woman who had no man s nor woman s love sinc ellen wa incap of love and judith wa too much like him and he must have seen at a glanc that bon even though the daughter might still be save from him had alreadi corrupt the son,faulkner
4599,4600,he had been too success you see hi wa that solitud of contempt and distrust which success bring to him who gain it becaus he wa strong instead of mere lucki,then june came and the end of the school year and henri and bon return to sutpen s hundr bon to spend a day or two befor ride on to the river to take the steamboat home to new orlean where sutpen had alreadi gone,faulkner
4601,4602,he stay but two day yet now if ever wa hi chanc to come to an understand with judith perhap even to fall in love with her,it wa hi onli chanc hi last chanc though of cours neither he nor judith could have known it sinc sutpen though but two week absent from home had doubtless alreadi found out about the octoroon mistress and the child,faulkner
4603,4604,so for the first and last time bon and judith might have been said to have a free have been sinc it wa realli ellen who had the free field,i can imagin her engin that courtship suppli judith and bon with opportun for tryst and pledg with a coy and unflag ubiqu which they must have tri in vain to evad and escap judith with annoy yet still seren concern bon with that sardon and surpris distast which seem to have been the ordinari manifest of the impenetr and shadowi charact,faulkner
4605,4606,ye shadowi a myth a phantom someth which they engend and creat whole themselv some effluvium of sutpen blood and charact as though as a man he did not exist at all,yet there wa the bodi which miss rosa saw which judith buri in the famili plot besid her mother,faulkner
4607,4608,and thi the fact that even an undefin and neverspoken engag surviv speak well for the postul that they did love one anoth sinc dure that two day mere romanc would have perish die of sheer saccharin and opportun,then bon rode on to the river and took the boat,faulkner
4609,4610,but henri did not go thi time,he rode to the river with bon and then return after a time sutpen return home too from where and for what purpos none were to know until the next christma and that summer pass the last summer the past summer of peac and content with henri doubtless without deliber intent plead bon s suit far better than bon than that indol fatalist had ever bother to plead it himself and judith listen with that seren that impenetr tranquil which a year or so befor had been the young girl s vagu and pointless and dreami unvolit but wa now alreadi a matur matur woman in,faulkner
4611,4612,that s when the letter came and henri read them all without jealousi with that complet abneg transfer metamorphosi into the bodi which wa to becom hi sister s lover,and sutpen say noth yet about what he had learn in new orlean but just wait unsuspect even by henri and judith wait for what nobodi know perhap in the hope that when bon learn as he would be oblig to that sutpen had discov hi secret he bon would realiz that the game wa up and not even return to school the next year,faulkner
4613,4614,but bon did return,he and henri met again at the univers the henri and bon both now make weekli journey by the hand of henri s groom and sutpen still wait certainli no one could say for what now incred that he should wait for christma for the crisi to come to man of whom it wa said that he not onli went out to meet hi troubl he sometim went out and manufactur them,faulkner
4615,4616,they went to new orlean,they rode through the bright cold of that christma day to the river and took the steamboat henri still do the lead the bring as he alway did until the veri last when for the first time dure their entir relationship bon led and henri follow,faulkner
4617,4618,henri did nt have to go,he had voluntarili made himself a pauper but he could have gone to hi grandfath,faulkner
4619,4620,no he did nt have to go,bon wa ride besid him tri to find out from him what had happen,faulkner
4621,4622,bon knew of cours what sutpen had discov in new orlean but he would need to know just what just how much sutpen had told henri and henri not tell him,doubtless henri wa ride the new mare which he probabl knew he would have to surrend sacrific too along with all the rest of hi life inherit go fast now and hi back rigid and irrevoc turn upon the hous hi birthplac and all the familiar scene of hi childhood and youth which he had repudi for the sake of that friend with whom despit the sacrific which he had just made out of love and loyalti he still could not be perfectli frank,faulkner
4623,4624,becaus he knew that what sutpen had told him wa true,he must have known that at the veri instant when he gave hi father the lie,faulkner
4625,4626,so he dare not ask bon to deni it he dare not you see,he could face poverti disinherit but he could not have born that lie from bon,faulkner
4627,4628,yet he went to new orlean,he went straight there to the onli place the veri place where he could not help but prove conclus the veri statement which come from hi father he had call a lie,faulkner
4629,4630,he went there for that purpos he went there to prove it,and bon ride besid him tri to find out what sutpen had told who for a year and a half now had been watch henri ape hi cloth and speech who for a year and a half now had seen himself as the object of that complet and abneg devot which onli a youth never a woman give to anoth youth or a man who for exactli a year now had seen the sister succumb to that same spell which the brother had alreadi succumb to and thi with no volit on the seduc s part without so much as the lift of a finger as though it actual were the brother who had put the spell on the sister seduc her to hi own vicari imag which walk and breath with bon s bodi,faulkner
4631,4632,yet here is the letter sent four year afterward written on a sheet of paper salvag from a gut hous in carolina with stove polish found in some captur yanke store four year after she had had ani messag from him save the messag from henri that he bon wa still aliv,so whether henri now knew about the other woman or not he would now have to know,faulkner
4633,4634,bon realiz that,i can imagin them as they rode henri still in the fierc repercuss flush of vindic loyalti and bon the wiser the shrewder even if onli from wider experi and a few more year of age learn from henri without henri s be awar of it what sutpen had told him,faulkner
4635,4636,becaus henri would have to know now,and i do nt believ it wa just to preserv henri as an alli for the crisi of some futur need,faulkner
4637,4638,it wa becaus bon not onli love judith after hi fashion but he love henri too and i believ in a deeper sens than mere after hi fashion,perhap in hi fatal he love henri the better of the two see perhap in the sister mere the shadow the woman vessel with which to consumm the love whose actual object wa the youth thi cerebr don juan who revers the order had learn to love what he had injur perhap it wa even more than judith or henri either perhap the life the exist which they repres,faulkner
4639,4640,becaus who know what pictur of peac he might have seen in that monoton provinci backwat what allevi and escap for a parch travel who had travel too far at too young an age in thi granitebound and simpl countri spring,and i can imagin how bon told henri broke it to him,faulkner
4641,4642,i can imagin henri in new orlean who had not yet even been in memphi whose entir worldli experi consist of sojourn at other hous plantat almost interchang with hi own where he follow the same routin which he did at same hunt and cockfight the same amateur race of hors on crude homemad track hors sound enough in blood and lineag yet not bred to race and perhap not even thirti minut out of the shaft of a trap or perhap even a carriag the same squar danc with ident and also interchang provinci virgin to music exactli like that at home the same champagn the best doubtless yet crude dispens out of the burlesqu pantomim eleg of negro butler who and likewis the drinker who gulp it down like neat whiskey between floweri and unsubtl toast would have treat lemonad the same way,i can imagin him with hi puritan heritag that heritag peculiarli fierc proud mystic and that abil to be asham of ignor and inexperi in that citi foreign and paradox with it atmospher at onc fatal and languor at onc feminin and grim humorless yokel out of a granit heritag where even the hous let alon cloth and conduct are built in the imag of a jealou and sadist jehovah put suddenli down in a place whose denizen had creat their allpow and hi support hierarchychoru of beauti saint and handsom angel in the imag of their hous and person ornament and voluptu live,faulkner
4643,4644,ye i can imagin how bon led up to it to the shock the skill the calcul prepar henri s puritan mind as he would have prepar a cramp and rocki field and plant it and rais the crop which he want,it would be the fact of the ceremoni regardless of what kind that henri would balk at bon knew thi,faulkner
4645,4646,no it would be the ceremoni a ceremoni enter into to be sure with a negro yet still a ceremoni thi is what bon doubtless thought,so i can imagin him the way he did it the way in which he took the innoc and neg plate of henri s provinci soul and intellect and expos it by slow degre to thi esoter milieu build gradual toward the pictur which he desir it to retain accept,faulkner
4647,4648,that s just the base the foundat,it can belong to anyon and henri you mean thi is not it,faulkner
4649,4650,that it is abov thi higher than thi more select than thi,and bon ye,faulkner
4651,4652,thi is onli the foundat,thi belong to anybodi,faulkner
4653,4654,a dialogu without word speech which would fix and then remov without obliter one line of the pictur thi background leav the background the plate prepar innoc again the plate docil with that puritan s humil toward anyth which is a matter of sens rather than logic fact the man the struggl and suffoc heart behind it say i will believ,i will,faulkner
4655,4656,i will,whether it is true or not i will believ,faulkner
4657,4658,wait for the next pictur which the mentor the corrupt intend for it that next pictur follow the fixat and accept of which the mentor would say again perhap with word now still watch the sober and thought face but still secur in hi knowledg and trust in that puritan heritag which must show disapprov instead of surpris or even despair and noth at all rather than have the disapprob constru as surpris or despair but even thi is not and henri you mean it is still higher than thi still abov thi,i will,faulkner
4659,4660,i will,ye that brief befor henri had had time to know what he had seen but now slow now would come the instant for which bon had wall unscal a gate ponder lock the sober and thought countri youth just wait look not yet ask whi,faulkner
4661,4662,or what,the gate of solid beam in place of the lacelik iron grill and they pass on bon knock at a small adjac doorway from which a swarthi man resembl a creatur out of an old woodcut of the french revolut erupt concern even a littl aghast look first at the daylight and then at henri and speak to bon in french which henri doe not understand and bon s teeth glint for an instant befor he answer in french with him,faulkner
4663,4664,an american,he is a guest i would have to let him choos weapon and i declin to fight with axe,faulkner
4665,4666,no no not that,just the key,faulkner
4667,4668,just the key and now the solid gate close behind them instead of befor no sight or evid abov the high thick wall of the low citi and scarc ani sound of it the labyrinthin mass of oleand and jasmin lantana and mimosa wall yet again the strip of bare earth comb and curri with powder shell rake and immacul and onli the most recent of the brown stain show now and the mentor the guid stand asid now to watch the grave provinci and pleasantli anecdot the customari way is to stand back to back the pistol in your right hand and the corner of the other cloak in your left,then at the signal you begin to walk and when you feel the cloak tauten you turn and fire,faulkner
4669,4670,though there are some now and then when the blood is especi hot or when it is still peasant blood who prefer knive and one cloak,they face one anoth insid the same cloak you see each hold the other s wrist with the left hand,faulkner
4671,4672,but that wa never my way casual chatti you see wait for the countryman s slow question who knew alreadi now befor he ask it what would you they be fight for,ye henri would know now or believ that he knew now anymor he would probabl consid anticlimax though it would not be it would be anyth but that the final blow stroke touch the keen surgeonlik compound which the now shock nerv of the patient would not even feel not know that the first hard shock were the random and crude,faulkner
4673,4674,becaus there wa that ceremoni,bon knew that that would be what henri would resist find hard to stomach and retain,faulkner
4675,4676,as they emerg and return to bon s room for that while impot even with talk shrewd no longer count upon that puritan charact which must show neither surpris nor despair have to count now on anyth on the corrupt itself the love he could not even say well,what do you say bout it,faulkner
4677,4678,he could onli wait and that upon the absolut unpredict action of a man who live by instinct and not reason until henri should speak but a bought woman,a whore and bon even gentli now not whore,faulkner
4679,4680,dont say that,and not whore becaus of us the thousand,faulkner
4681,4682,we the thousand the white men made them creat and produc them we even made the law which declar that one eighth of a specifi kind of blood shall outweigh seven eighth of anoth kind,i admit that,faulkner
4683,4684,but that same white race would have made them slave too labor cook mayb even field hand if it were not for thi thousand these few men like myself without principl or honor either perhap you will say,we can not perhap we do not even want to save all of them perhap the thousand we save are not one in a thousand,faulkner
4685,4686,but we save that one,god may mark everi sparrow but we do not pretend to be god you see,faulkner
4687,4688,perhap we do not even want to be god sinc no man would want but one of these sparrow,and perhap when god look into one of these establish like you saw tonight he would not choos one of us to be god either now that he is old,faulkner
4689,4690,though he must have been young onc sure he wa young onc and sure someon who ha exist as long as he ha who ha look at as much crude and promiscu sin without grace or restraint or decorum as he ha had to to contempl at last even though the instanc are not one in a thousand thousand the principl of honor decorum and gentl appli to perfectli normal human instinct which you anglosaxon insist upon call lust and in whose servic you revert in sabbat to the primordi cavern the fall from what you call grace fog and cloud by heavendefi word of extenu and explan the return to grace herald by heavenplac cri of satiat abas and flagel in neither of defianc or the heaven find interest or even after the first two or three time divers,so perhap now that god is an old man he is not interest in the way we serv what you call lust either perhap he doe not even requir of us that we save thi one sparrow anymor than we save the one sparrow which we do save for ani commend from him,faulkner
4691,4692,but we do save that one who but for us would have been sold to ani brute who had the price not sold to him for the night like a white prostitut but bodi and soul for life to him who could have use her with more impun than he would dare to use an anim heifer or mare and then discard or sold or even murder when worn out or when her keep and her price no longer balanc,ye a sparrow which god himself neglect to mark,faulkner
4693,4694,becaus though men white men creat her god did not stop it,no not whore,faulkner
4695,4696,not even taken at childhood cull and chosen and rais more care than ani white girl ani nun than ani blood mare even by a person who give them the unsleep care and attent which no mother ever give,for a price of cours but a price offer and accept or declin through a system more formal than ani that white girl are sold under sinc they are more valuabl as commod than white girl rais and train to fulfil a woman s sole end and purpos to love to be beauti to divert never to see a man s face hardli until brought to the ball and offer to and chosen by some man who in return not can and not will but must suppli her with the surround proper in which to love and be beauti and divert and who must usual risk hi life or at least hi blood for that privileg,faulkner
4697,4698,no not whore,sometim i believ that they are the onli true chast women not to say virgin in america and they remain true and faith to that man not mere until he die or free them but until they die,faulkner
4699,4700,and where will you find whore or ladi either whom you can count on to do that,and henri but you marri her,faulkner
4701,4702,you marri her and would be a littl quicker now sharper now though still gentl still patient though still the iron the steel the gambler not quit yet reduc to hi final trump ah,that ceremoni,faulkner
4703,4704,i see,that s it then,faulkner
4705,4706,whi not call that a marriag too,and henri oh i know,faulkner
4707,4708,i know,you give me two and two and you tell me it make five and it doe make five,faulkner
4709,4710,but there is still the marriag,suppos i assum an oblig to a man who can not speak my languag the oblig state to him in hi own and i agre to it am i ani the less oblig becaus i did not happen to know the tongu in which he accept me in good faith,faulkner
4711,4712,no the more the mote,and trump now the voic gentl now have you forgot that thi woman thi child are nigger,faulkner
4713,4714,you henri sutpen of sutpen s hundr in mississippi,you talk of marriag a wed here,faulkner
4715,4716,and henri the despair now the last bitter cri of irrevoc undefeat ye,i know,faulkner
4717,4718,i know that,but it s still there,faulkner
4719,4720,it s not right,not even you do it make it right,faulkner
4721,4722,not even you,so that wa all,faulkner
4723,4724,it should have been all that afternoon four year later should have happen the next day the four year the interv mere anticlimax an attenu and prolong of a conclus alreadi ripe to happen by the war by a stupid and bloodi aberr in the high and imposs destini of the unit state mayb instig by that famili fatal which possess along with all circumst that curiou lack of economi between caus and effect which is alway a characterist of fate when reduc to use human be for tool materi,anyway henri wait four year hold the three of them in that abey that duranc wait hope for bon to renounc the woman and dissolv the marriag which he henri admit wa no marriag and which he must have known as soon as he saw the woman and the child that bon would not renounc,faulkner
4725,4726,in fact as time pass and henri becam accustom to the idea of that ceremoni which wa still no marriag that may have been the troubl with the two ceremoni but the two women not the fact that bon s intent wa to commit bigami but that it wa appar to make hi henri s sister a sort of junior partner in a harem,anyway he wait hope for four year,faulkner
4727,4728,that spring they return north into mississippi,bull run had been fought and there wa a compani organ at the univers among the student bodi,faulkner
4729,4730,henri and bon join it,probabl henri wrote judith where they were and what they intend to do,faulkner
4731,4732,they enlist togeth you see henri watch bon and bon permit himself to be watch the probat the duranc the one who dare not let the other out of hi sight not from fear that bon would marri judith with henri not there to stop it but that bon would marri judith and then he henri would have to live for the rest of hi life with the knowledg that he wa glad that he had been so betray with the coward s joy of surrend without have been vanquish the other for that same reason too who could not have want judith without henri sinc he must never have doubt but what he could marri judith when he wish in spite of brother and father both becaus as i said befor it wa not judith who wa the object of bon s love or of henri s solicitud,she wa just the blank shape the empti vessel in which each of them strove to preserv not the illus of himself nor hi illus of the other but what each conceiv the other to believ him to be the man and the youth seduc and seduc who had known one anoth seduc and been seduc victim in turn each by the other conquer vanquish by hi own strength vanquish conquer by hi own weak befor judith came into their joint live even by so much as girlnam,faulkner
4733,4734,and who know,there wa the war now who know but what the fatal and the fatal s victim did not both think hope that the war would settl the matter leav free one of the two irreconcil sinc it would not be the first time that youth ha taken catastroph as a direct act of provid for the sole purpos of solv a person problem which youth itself could not solv,faulkner
4735,4736,and judith how els to explain her but thi way,sure bon could not have corrupt her to fatal in twelv day who not onli had not tri to corrupt her to unchast but not even to defi her father,faulkner
4737,4738,no anyth but a fatalist who wa the sutpen with the ruthless sutpen code of take what it want provid it were strong enough of the two children as henri wa the coldfield with the coldfield clutter of moral and rule of right and wrong who while henri scream and vomit look down from the loft that night on the spectacl of sutpen fight halfnak with one of hi halfnak nigger with the same cold and attent interest with which sutpen would have watch henri fight with a negro boy of hi own age and weight,becaus she could not have known the reason for her father s object to the marriag,faulkner

5395,5396,and yet thi old gal thi aunt rosa told you that someon wa hide out there and you said it wa clyti or jim bond and she said no and you said it would have to be becaus the demon wa dead and judith wa dead and bon wa dead and henri gone so far he had nt even left a grave and she said no and so you went out there drove the twelv mile at night in a buggi and you found clyti and jim bond both in it and you said you see,and she the aunt rosa still said no and so you went on and there wa,faulkner
5397,5398,ye,wait then shreve said,faulkner
5399,5400,for god s sake wait,so it is zero outsid quentin thought soon he will rais the window and do deepbreath in it clenchfist and nake to the waist in the warm and rosi orific abov the iron quad,faulkner
5401,5402,but he had not done so yet and now the moment the thought wa an hour past and the pipe lay smoke out and overturn and cold with a light sprinkl of ash about it on the tabl befor shreve s cross pink brighthair arm while he watch quentin from behind the two opaqu and lampglar moon of hi spectacl,so he just want a grandson shreve said,faulkner
5403,5404,that wa all he wa after,jesu the south is fine is nt it,faulkner
5405,5406,it s better than the theater is nt it,it s better than ben hur is nt it,faulkner
5407,5408,no wonder you have to come away now and then is nt it,quentin did not answer,faulkner
5409,5410,he sat quit still face the tabl hi hand lie on either side of the open text book on which the letter rest the rectangl of paper fold across the middl and now open three quarter open whose bulk had rais half itself by the leverag of the old creas in weightless and paradox levit lie at such an angl that he could not possibl have read it deciph it even without thi ad distort,yet he seem to be look at it or as near as shreve could tell he wa hi face lower a littl brood almost sullen,faulkner
5411,5412,he told grandfath about it he said,that time when the architect escap tri to escap into the river bottom and go back to new orlean or wherev it wa and the demon hey,faulkner
5413,5414,shreve said,quentin did not answer him did not paus hi voic level curiou a littl dreami yet still with that overton of sullen bemus of smolder outrag so that shreve still too resembl in hi spectacl and noth els from the waist down the tabl conceal him so anyon enter the room would have taken him to be stark nake a baroqu effigi creat out of color cake dough by someon with a faintli nightmarish affin for the pervers watch him with thought and intent curios,faulkner
5415,5416,he sent word in to grandfath quentin said and some other and got hi dog and hi wild nigger out and hunt the architect down and made him take earth in a cave under the river bank two day later,that wa in the second summer when they had finish all the brick and had the foundat laid and most of the big timber cut and trim and one day the architect could nt stand it anymor or he wa afraid he would starv or that the wild nigger and mayb colonel sutpen too would run out of grub and eat him or mayb he got homesick or mayb he just had to go mayb he had a girl shreve said,faulkner
5417,5418,or mayb he just want a girl,you said the demon and the nigger did nt have but two,faulkner
5419,5420,quentin did not answer thi either again he might not have heard talk in that curiou repress calm voic as though to the tabl befor him or the book upon it or the letter upon the book or hi hand lie on either side of the book,so he went,faulkner
5421,5422,he seem to vanish in broad daylight right out from the middl of twentyon peopl,or mayb it wa just sutpen s back that wa turn and that the nigger saw him go and did nt think it need mention that be wild men they probabl did nt know what sutpen himself wa up to and him nake in the mud with them all day,faulkner
5423,5424,so i reckon the nigger never did know what the architect wa there for suppos to do or had done or could do or wa so mayb they thought sutpen had sent him told him to go away and drown himself go away and die or mayb just go away,so he did jump up in broad daylight in hi embroid vest and fauntleroy tie and a hat like a baptist congressman and probabl carri the hat in hi hand and ran into the swamp and the nigger watch him out of sight and then went back to work and sutpen did nt even miss him until night suppertim probabl and the nigger told him and he declar a holiday tomorrow becaus he would have to get out and borrow some dog,faulkner
5425,5426,not that he would have need dog with hi nigger to trail but mayb he thought that the guest the other would not be use to trail with nigger and would expect dog,and grandfath he wa young then too brought some champagn and some of the other brought whiskey and they began to gather out there a littl after sundown at sutpen s hous that did nt even have wall yet that wa nt anyth yet but some line of brick sunk into the ground but that wa all right becaus they did nt go to bed anyhow grandfath said,faulkner
5427,5428,they just sat around the fire with the champagn and the whiskey and a quarter of the last venison sutpen had kill and about midnight the man with the dog came,then it wa daylight and the dog had a littl troubl at first becaus some of the wild nigger had run out about a mile of the trail just for fun,faulkner
5429,5430,but they got the trail straighten out at last the dog and the nigger in the bottom and most of the men ride along the edg of it where the go wa good,but grandfath and colonel sutpen went with the dog and the nigger becaus sutpen wa afraid the nigger might catch the architect befor he could reach them,faulkner
5431,5432,he and grandfath had to walk a good deal send one of the nigger to lead the hors on around the bad place until they could ride again,grandfath said it wa fine weather and the trail lay pretti good but sutpen said it would have been fine if the architect had just wait until octob or novemb,faulkner
5433,5434,and so he told grandfath someth about himself,sutpen s troubl wa innoc,faulkner
5435,5436,all of a sudden he discov not what he want to do but what he just had to do had to do it whether he want to or not becaus if he did not do it he knew that he could never live with himself for the rest of hi life never live with what all the men and women that had die to make him had left insid of him for him to pass on with all the dead one wait and watch to see if he wa go to do it right fix thing right so that he would be abl to look in the face not onli the old dead one but all the live one that would come after him when he would be one of the dead,and that at the veri moment when he discov what it wa he found out that thi wa the last thing in the world he wa equip to do becaus he not onli had not known that he would have to do thi he did not even know that it exist to be want to need to be done until he wa almost fourteen year old,faulkner
5437,5438,becaus he wa born in west virginia in the not in west virginia shreve,quentin said,faulkner
5439,5440,becaus if he wa twentyf year old in mississippi in he wa born in,becaus where he live the land belong to anybodi and everybodi and so the man who would go to the troubl and work to fenc off a piec of it and say thi is mine wa crazi and as for object nobodi had ani more of them than you did becaus everybodi had just what he wa strong enough or energet enough to take and keep and onli that crazi man would go to the troubl to take or even want more than he could eat or swap for powder and whiskey,faulkner
5441,5442,so he had hardli heard of such a world until he fell into it,that s how it wa,faulkner
5443,5444,they fell into it the whole famili return to the coast from which the first sutpen had come when the ship from the old bailey reach jamestown probabl tumbl head over heel back to tidewat by sheer altitud elev and graviti as if whatev slight hold the famili had had on the mountain had broken,he said someth to grandfath about hi mother die about that time and how hi pap said she wa a fine weari woman and that he would miss her and someth about how it wa the wife that had got hi father even that far west,faulkner
5445,5446,and now the whole passel of them from the father through the grown daughter down to one that could nt even walk yet slid back down out of the mountain skate in a kind of acceler and sloven and inert coher like a useless collect of flotsam on a flood river move by some pervers automotiv such as inanim object sometim show backward against the veri current of the stream across the virginia plateau and into the slack lowland about the mouth of the jame river,he did nt know whi they move or did nt rememb the reason if he ever knew it wa optim hope in hi father s breast or nostalgia sinc he did nt know just where hi father had come from whether from the countri to which they return or not or even if hi father knew rememb want to rememb and find it again,faulkner
5447,5448,he did nt know whether somebodi some travel had told him of some easi place or time some escap from the hardship of get food and keep warm in the mountain way or if perhap somebodi hi father knew onc or who knew hi father onc and rememb him happen to think about him or someon kin to him who had tri to forget him and could nt quit do it had sent for him and he had obey go not for the promis job but for the eas have faith perhap in the blood kinship to evad the labor if it wa kinship and in hi own inertia and in whatev god had watch over him thi far if it were not,but all he the demon shreve said wa that one morn the father rose and told the older girl to pack what food they had and somebodi wrap up the babi and somebodi els threw water on the fire and they walk down the mountain to where road exist,faulkner
5449,5450,they had a lopsid twowheel cart and two spavin oxen now,he told grandfath he did not rememb just where nor when nor how hi father had got it,faulkner
5451,5452,he wa ten then the two older boy had left home some time befor and had not been heard of sinc,he drove the oxen sinc almost as soon as they got the cart hi father began the practic of accomplish that part of the translat devot to motion flat on hi back in the cart oblivi among the quilt and lantern and well bucket and bundl of cloth and children snore with alcohol,faulkner
5453,5454,that wa how he told it,he did nt rememb if it wa week or month or a year they travel except that one of the older girl who had left the cabin unmarri wa still unmarri when they final stop though she had becom a mother befor they lost the last blue mountain rang,faulkner
5455,5456,he did nt rememb whether it wa that winter and then spring and then summer that overtook and pass them on the road or whether they overtook and pass in slow success the season as they descend or whether it wa the descent itself that did it and they not progress parallel in time but descend perpendicularli through temperatur and you could nt call it a period becaus as he rememb it or as he told grandfath he did it did nt have either a definit begin or a definit end,that s the way he got it,faulkner
5457,5458,he had learn the differ not onli between white men and black one but he wa learn that there wa a differ between white men and white men not to be measur by lift anvil or goug eye or how much whiskey you could drink then get up and walk out of the room,he had begun to discern that without be awar of it yet,faulkner
5459,5460,he still thought that that wa just a matter of where you were spawn and how whether you were lucki or not lucki and that the lucki one would be even slower and loather than the unlucki to take ani advantag of it or credit for it or to feel that it gave them anyth more than the luck and he still thought that they would feel if anyth more tender toward the unlucki than the unlucki would ever need to feel toward them,he wa to find all that out later,faulkner
5461,5462,he rememb when he found it out becaus that wa the same second when he discov hi innoc,it wa not the second the moment that he wa long about it wa the get to it the moment when they must have realiz believ at last that they were no longer travel move go the be still at last and in a fashion settl becaus they had done that befor on the road he rememb how one time the gradual differ in comfort between the presenc and absenc of shoe and warm cloth occur in one place a cowsh where the sister s babi wa born and as he told grandfath for all he could rememb conceiv too,faulkner
5463,5464,becaus they were stop now at last,he did nt know where they were,faulkner
5465,5466,for a time dure the first day or week or month the woodsman s instinct which he had acquir from the environ where he grew up or that mayb had been bequeath him by the two brother who had vanish one of whom had been as far west as the mississippi river one instinct bequeath him along with the wornout buckskin garment and such which they left in the cabin when they depart the last time for good and which he had sharpen by boy s practic at small game and him orient so that he could have so he said found hi way back to the mountain cabin in time,but that wa past now behind him the moment when he last could have said exactli where he had been born,faulkner
5467,5468,he wa now week and month mayb a year sinc he becam confus about hi age and wa never abl to straighten it out again so that he told grandfath that he did not know within a year on either side just how old he wa,so he knew neither where he had come from nor where he wa nor whi,faulkner
5469,5470,he wa just there surround by the face almost all the face which he had ever known though the number of them wa decreas thin out despit the effort of the unmarri sister who pretti soon so he told grandfath and still without ani wed had anoth babi decreas becaus of the climat the warmth the damp live in a cabin that wa almost a replica of the mountain one except that it did nt sit up in the bright wind but sat instead besid a big flat river that sometim show no current at all and even sometim ran backward where hi sister and brother seem to take sick after supper and die befor the next meal where regiment of nigger with white men watch them plant and rais thing that he had never heard of,the old man did someth besid drink now at least he would leav the cabin after breakfast and return sober to supper and he fed them somehow,faulkner
5471,5472,and the man wa there who own all the land and the nigger and appar the white men who superintend the work and who live in the biggest hous he had ever seen and who spent most of the afternoon he told how he would creep up among the tangl shrubberi of the lawn and lie hidden and watch the man in a barrel stave hammock between two tree with hi shoe off and a nigger who wore everi day better cloth than he or hi father and sister had ever own and ever expect to who did noth els but fan him and bring him drink,and he he wa eleven or twelv or thirteen now becaus thi wa where he realiz that he had irrevoc lost count of hi age would lie there all afternoon while the sister would come from time to time to the door of the cabin two mile away and scream at him for wood or water watch that man who not onli had shoe in the summertim too but did nt even have to wear them,faulkner
5473,5474,but he still did nt envi the man he wa watch,he covet the shoe and probabl he would have like for hi father to have a broadcloth monkey to hand him the jug and to carri the wood and water into the cabin for hi sister to wash and cook with and keep the hous warm so that he himself would not have to do it,faulkner
5475,5476,mayb he even realiz understood the pleasur it would have given hi sister for their neighbor other white like them who live in other cabin not quit as well built and not at all as well kept and preserv as the one the nigger slave live in but still imbu with freedom s bright aura which the slave quarter were not for all their sound roof and whitewash to see them be wait on,becaus he had not onli not lost the innoc yet he had not yet discov that he possess it,faulkner
5477,5478,he no more envi the man than he would have envi a mountain man who happen to own a fine rifl,he would have covet the rifl but he would himself have support and confirm the owner s pride and pleasur in it ownership becaus he could not have conceiv of the owner take such crass advantag of the luck which gave the rifl to him rather than to anoth as to say to other men becaus i own hi rifl my arm and leg and blood and bone are superior to your except as the victori outcom of a fight with rifl and how in the world could a man fight anoth man with dressedup nigger and the fact that he could lie in a hammock all afternoon with hi shoe off,faulkner
5479,5480,and what in the world would he be fight for if he did,he did nt even know he wa innoc that day when hi father sent him to the big hous with the messag,faulkner
5481,5482,he did nt rememb or did not say what the messag wa appar he still did nt know exactli just what hi father did or mayb wa suppos to do what work the old man had in relat to the plantat,becaus he wa still innoc,faulkner
5483,5484,you knew that you could hit them he told grandfath and they would not hit back or even resist,but you did not want to becaus they the nigger were not it not what you want to hit that you knew when you hit them you would just be hit a child s toy balloon with a face paint on it a face slick and smooth and distend and about to burst into laugh and so you did not dare strike it becaus it would mere burst and you would rather let it walk on out of your sight than to have stood there in the loud laugh,faulkner
5485,5486,he rememb talk at night befor the fire when they had compani or had themselv gone visit after supper to anoth cabin the voic of the women sober enough even calm yet fill with a qualiti dark and sullen and onli some man usual hi father in drink to break out into harsh recapitul of hi own worth the respect which hi own physic prowess command from hi fellow and the boy of either thirteen or fourteen or mayb twelv know that the men and the women were talk about the same thing though it had never onc been mention by name as when peopl talk about privat without mention the sieg about sick without ever name the epidem,he rememb one afternoon when he and hi sister were walk along the road and he heard the carriag come up behind them and step off the road and then realiz that hi sister wa not go to give way to it that she still walk in the middl of the road with a sort of sullen implac in the veri angl of her head and he shout at her and then it wa all dust and rear hors and glint har buckl and wheel spoke he saw two parasol in the carriag and the nigger coachman in a plug hat shout hoo dar gal,faulkner
5487,5488,git outen de way dar,and then it wa over gone the carriag and the dust the two face beneath the parasol glare down at hi sister then he wa throw vain clod of dirt after the dust as it spun on,faulkner
5489,5490,he knew now while the monkeydress nigger butler kept the door bar with hi bodi while he spoke that it had not been the nigger coachman that he threw at at all that it wa the actual dust rais by the proud delic wheel and just that vain,he thought of one night late when hi father came home blunder into the cabin he could smell the whiskey even while still dull with broken sleep hear that same fierc exult vindic in hi father s voic we whup one of pettibon s nigger tonight and he rous at that wake at that ask which one of pettibon s nigger and hi father said he did not know had never seen the nigger befor and he ask what the nigger had done and hi father said hell fire that goddam son of a bitch pettibon s nigger,faulkner
5491,5492,he must have meant the question the same way hi father meant the answer without know it then sinc he had not yet discov innoc no actual nigger live creatur live flesh to feel pain and writh and cri out,he could even seem to see them the torchdisturb dark among tree the fierc hyster face of the white men the balloon face of the nigger,faulkner
5493,5494,mayb the nigger s hand would be tie or held but that would be all right becaus they were not the hand with which the balloon face would struggl and writh for freedom not the balloon face it wa just pois among them levit and slick with paperthin distens,then someon would strike the balloon one singl desper and despair blow and then he would seem to see them flee run with all about them overtak them and pass and go on and then return to overwhelm them again the roar wave of mellow laughter meaningless and terrifi and loud,faulkner
5495,5496,and now he stood there befor that white door with the monkey nigger bar it and look down at him in hi patch madeov jean cloth and no shoe and i do nt reckon he had even ever experi with a comb becaus that would be one of the thing that hi sister would keep hidden good,he had never thought about hi own hair or cloth or anybodi els s hair or cloth until he saw that monkey nigger who through no do of hi own happen to have had the felic of be housebr in richmond mayb or mayb even in charleston shreve breath,faulkner
5497,5498,at them and he never even rememb what the nigger said how it wa the nigger told him even befor he had had time to say what he came for never to come to that front door again but to go around to the back,he did nt even rememb leav,faulkner
5499,5500,all of a sudden he found himself run and alreadi some distanc from the hous and not toward home,he wa not cri he said,faulkner
5501,5502,he wa nt even mad,he just had to think so he wa go to where he could be quiet and think and he knew where that place wa,faulkner
5503,5504,he went into the wood,he say he did not tell himself where to go that hi bodi hi feet just went place where a game trail enter a canebrak and an oak tree had fallen across it and made a kind of cave where he kept an iron griddl that he would cook small game on sometim,faulkner
5505,5506,he said he crawl back into the cave and sat with hi back against the uptorn root and thought,becaus he could nt get it straight yet,faulkner
5507,5508,he could nt even realiz yet that hi troubl hi impedi wa innoc becaus he would not be abl to realiz that until he got it straight,so he wa seek among what littl he had to call experi for someth to measur it by and he could nt find anyth,faulkner
5509,5510,he had been told to go around to the back door even befor he could state hi errand who had sprung from a peopl whose hous did nt have back door but onli window and anyon enter or leav by a window would be either hide or escap neither of which he wa do,in fact he had actual come on busi in the good faith of busi which he had believ that all men accept,faulkner
5511,5512,of cours he had not expect to be invit in to eat a meal sinc time the distanc from one cook pot to the next did not need to be measur in hour or day perhap he had not expect to be ask into the hous at all,but he did expect to be listen to becaus he had come been sent on some busi which even though he did nt rememb what it wa and mayb at the time he said he might not even have comprehend wa certainli connect somehow with the plantat that support and endur that smooth white hous and that smooth white brassdecor door and the veri broadcloth and linen and silk stock the monkey nigger stood in to tell him to go around to the back befor he could even state the busi,faulkner
5513,5514,it wa like he might have been sent with a lump of lead or even a few mold bullet so that the man who own the fine rifl could shoot it and the man came to the door and told him to leav the bullet on a stump at the edg of the wood not even let him come close enough to look at the rifl,becaus he wa not mad,faulkner
5515,5516,he insist on that to grandfath,he wa just think becaus he knew that someth would have to be done about it he would have to do someth about it in order to live with himself for the rest of hi life and he could not decid what it wa becaus of that innoc which he had just discov he had which the innoc not the man the tradit he would have to compet with,faulkner
5517,5518,he had noth to compar and gaug it by but the rifl analog and it would not make sens by that,he wa quit calm about it he said sit there with hi arm around hi knee in hi littl den besid the game trail where more than onc when the wind wa right he had seen deer pass within ten feet of him argu with himself quietli and calmli while both debat agre that if there were onli someon els some older and smarter person to ask,faulkner
5519,5520,but there wa not there wa onli himself the two of them insid that one bodi argu quiet and calm but i can shoot him,not the monkey nigger,faulkner
5521,5522,it wa not the nigger anymor than it had been the nigger that hi father had help to whip that night,that would nt do no good and the first what shall we do then,faulkner
5523,5524,and the other i do nt know and the first but i can shoot him,i could slip right up there through them bush and lay there until he come out to lay in the hammock and shoot him and the other no,faulkner
5525,5526,that would nt do no good and the first then what shall we do,and the other i do nt know,faulkner
5527,5528,now he wa hungri,it wa befor dinner when he went to the big hous and now there wa no sun at all where he crouch though he could still see sun in the top of the tree around him,faulkner
5529,5530,but hi stomach had alreadi told him it wa late and that it would be later still when he reach home,and then he said he began to think home,faulkner
5531,5532,but it did nt happen at onc becaus hi father wa not at home yet,so it wa onli the sister as if she had been wait not for the wood but just for him to return for the opportun to use her vocal cord nag at him to fetch the wood and he not refus not object just not hear her pay ani attent to her becaus he wa still think,faulkner
5533,5534,then the old man came and the sister told on him and the old man made him fetch the wood and still noth said about the errand while they ate supper nor when he went and lay down on the pallet where he slept and where he went to bed by just lie down onli not to sleep now just lie there with hi hand under hi head and still noth said about it and he still not know if he wa go to lie or not,becaus he said to grandfath the terribl part of it had not occur to him yet he just lay there while the two of them argu insid of him speak in orderli turn both calm even lean backward to be calm and reason and unrancor but i can kill him,faulkner
5535,5536,no,that would nt do no what shall we do about it do nt know and he just listen not especi interest he said hear the two of them without listen,faulkner
5537,5538,becaus what he wa think about now he had nt ask for,it wa just there natur in a boy a child and he not pay ani attent to it either becaus it wa what a boy would have thought and he knew that to do what he had to do in order to live with himself he would have to think it out straight as a man would think the nigger never give me a chanc to tell him what it wa and so he not the nigger now either wont know it and whatev it is wont get done and he wont know it aint done until too late so he will get paid back that much for what he set that nigger to do and if it onli wa to tell him that the stabl the hous wa on fire and the nigger would nt even let me tell him warn him,faulkner
5539,5540,it wa like that he said like an bright glare that vanish and left noth no ash nor refus just a limitless flat plain with the sever shape of hi intact innoc rise from it like a monument that innoc instruct him as calm as the other had ever spoken use hi own rifl analog to do it with and when it said them in place of he or him it meant more than all the human puni mortal under the sun that might lie in hammock all afternoon with their shoe off he thought if you were fix to combat them that had the fine rifl the first thing you would do would be to get yourself the nearest thing to a fine rifl you could borrow or steal or make would nt it,and he said ye,faulkner
5541,5542,but thi aint a question of rifl,so to combat them you have got to have what they have that made them do what the man did,faulkner
5543,5544,you got to have land and nigger and a fine hous to combat them with,you see,faulkner
5545,5546,and he said ye again,he left that night,faulkner
5547,5548,he wake befor day and depart just like he went to bed by rise from the pallet and tipto out of the hous,he never saw ani of hi famili again,faulkner
5549,5550,he went to the west indi,quentin had not move not even to rais hi head from it attitud of brood bemus upon the open letter which lay on the open textbook hi hand lie on the tabl befor him on either side of the book and the letter one half of which slant upward from the transvers creas without support as if it had learn half the secret of levit,faulkner
5551,5552,that wa how sutpen said it,he and grandfath were sit on a log now becaus the dog had fault,faulkner
5553,5554,that is they had tree from which he the architect could not have escap yet which he had undoubtedli mount becaus they found the sapl pole with hi suspend still knot about one end of it that he had use to climb the tree though at first they could not understand whi the suspend and it wa three hour befor they comprehend that the architect had use architectur physic to elud them as a man alway fall back upon what he know best in a murder upon murder the thief thiev the liar lie,he the architect knew about the wild negro even if he could nt have known that sutpen would get dog he had chosen that tree and haul that pole up after him and calcul stress and distanc and trajectori and had cross a gap to the next nearest tree that a fli squirrel could not have cross and travel from there on from tree to tree for almost half a mile befor he put foot on the ground again,faulkner
5555,5556,it wa three hour befor one of the wild nigger the dog would nt leav the tree they said he wa in it found where he had come down,so he and grandfath sat on the log and talk and one of the wild nigger went back to camp for grub and the rest of the whiskey and they blew the other men in with horn and they ate and he told grandfath some more of it while they wait,faulkner
5557,5558,he went to the west indi,that s how sutpen said it not how he manag to find where the west indi were nor where ship depart from to go there not how he got to where the ship were and got in one nor how he like the sea nor about the hardship of a sailor s life and it must have been hardship inde for him a boy of fourteen or fifteen who had never seen the ocean befor go to sea in,faulkner
5559,5560,grandfath in that same tone while they sat on the log wait for the nigger to come back with the other guest and the whiskey so i went to the west indi,i had had some school dure a part of one winter enough to have learn someth about them to realiz that they would be most suitabl to the expedi of my requir,faulkner
5561,5562,he did nt rememb how he came to go to the school,that is whi hi father decid all of a sudden to send him what nebul vision or shape might have evolv out of the fog of alcohol and niggerb and scheme to avoid work which hi old man call hi imag not of ambit nor glori not to see hi son better himself for hi own sake probabl not even some blind instant of revolt against that same hous whose roof had leak on probabl a hundr famili like hi which had come and live beneath it and vanish and left no trace noth not even rag and broken crockeri but wa probabl mere vindict envi toward one or two men planter whom he had to see everi now and then,faulkner
5563,5564,anyway he wa sent to school for about three month one adolesc boy of thirteen or fourteen in a room full of children three or four year younger than he and three or four year further advanc and he not onli probabl bigger than the teacher the kind of teacher that would be teach a oneroom countri school in a nest of tidewat plantat but a good deal more of a man who probabl brought into the school with him along with hi sober watch mountain reserv a good deal of latent insubordin that he would not be awar of ani more than he would be awar at first that the teacher wa afraid of him,it would not be intract and mayb you could nt call it pride either but mayb just the selfreli of mountain and solitud sinc some of hi blood at least hi mother wa a mountain woman a scottish woman who so he told grandfath never did quit learn to speak english had been bred in mountain but which whatev it wa wa that which forbad him to condescend to memor dri sum and such but which did permit him to listen when the teacher read aloud,faulkner
5565,5566,to school where he told grandfath i learn littl save that most of the deed good and bad both incur opprobium or plaudit or reward either within the scope of man s abil had alreadi been perform and were to be learn about onli from book,so i listen when he would read to us,faulkner
5567,5568,i realiz now that on most of these occas he resort to read aloud onli when he saw that the moment had come when hi entir school wa on the point of rise and leav the room,but whatev the reason he read to us and i anyway listen though i did not know that in that listen i wa equip myself better for what i should later design to do than if i had learn all the addit and subtract in the book,faulkner
5569,5570,that wa how i learn of the west indi,not where they were though if i had known at the time that that knowledg would someday serv me i would have learn that too,faulkner
5571,5572,what i learn wa that there wa a place call the west indi to which poor men went in ship and becam rich it did nt matter how so long as that man wa clever and courag the latter of which i believ that i possess the former of which i believ that if it were to be learn by energi and will in the school of endeavor and experi i should learn,i rememb how i remain one afternoon when school wa out and wait for the teacher waylaid him he wa a smallish man who alway look dusti as if he had been born and live all hi life in attic and store room,faulkner
5573,5574,i recal how he start back when he saw me and how i thought at the time that if i were to strike him there would be no result outcri but mere the sound of the blow and a puff of dust in the air as when you strike a rug hang from a line,i ask him if it were true if what he had read us about the men who got rich in the west indi were true,faulkner
5575,5576,whi not,he answer start back,faulkner
5577,5578,did nt you hear me read it from the book,how do i know that what you read wa in the book,faulkner
5579,5580,i said,i wa that green that countrifi you see,faulkner
5581,5582,i had not then learn to read my own name although i had been attend the school for almost three month i daresay i knew no more than i did when i enter the schoolroom for the first time,but i had to know you see,faulkner
5583,5584,perhap a man build for hi futur in more way than one build not onli toward the bodi which will be hi tomorrow or next year but toward action and the subsequ irrevoc cours of result action which hi weak sens and intellect can not forse but which ten or twenti or thirti year from now he will take will have to take in order to surviv the act,perhap it wa that instinct and not i who grasp one of hi arm as he drew back i did not actual doubt him,faulkner
5585,5586,i think that even then even at my age i realiz that he could not have invent it that he lack that someth which is necessari in a man to enabl him to fool even a child by lie,but you see i had to be sure had to take whatev method that came to my hand to make sure,faulkner
5587,5588,and there wa noth els to hand except him glare at me and begin to struggl and i hold him and wa quit calm quit calm i just had to know say suppos i went there and found out that it wa not so,and he shriek now shout help,faulkner
5589,5590,help,so that i let him go,faulkner
5591,5592,so when the time came when i realiz that to accomplish my design i should need first of all and abov all thing money in consider quantiti and in the quit immedi futur i rememb what he had read to us and i went to the west indi,then the other guest began to ride up and after a while the nigger came back with the coffe pot and a deer haunch and the whiskey and one bottl of champagn which they had overlook grandfath said and sutpen stop talk for a while,faulkner
5593,5594,he did nt tell anymor of it until they had eaten and were sit around smoke while the nigger and the dog made cast in all direct,they had to drag the dog away from the tree but especi away from the sapl pole with the architect s suspend tie to it as if it wa not onli that the pole wa the last thing the architect had touch but it wa the thing hi exult had touch when he saw anoth chanc to elud them and so it wa not onli the man but the exult too which the dog smell that made them wild,faulkner
5595,5596,and he never told whether the voyag wa hard or not how much he must have had to endur to make it,but then he believ that all that wa necessari wa courag and shrewd and the one he knew he had and the other he believ he could learn if it were to be taught and it probabl wa the hardship of the voyag which comfort him and that the men who said the ship wa go to the west indi had not lie to him becaus at that time grandfath said he probabl could not have believ in anyth that wa easi he said there it is and got up and they all went on and found where the architect had come back to the ground again with a gain of almost three hour,faulkner
5597,5598,so they had to go fast now and there wa nt much time to talk or at least grandfath said he did not appear to intend to resum,then the sun went down and the other men had to start back to town they all went except grandfath becaus he want to listen some more,faulkner
5599,5600,so he sent word in by one of the other he wa not marri then either that he would not be home and he and sutpen went on until the light fail,two of the nigger they were thirteen mile from sutpen s camp then had alreadi gone back to get blanket and more grub,faulkner
5601,5602,then it wa dark and the nigger began to light pine knot and they went on for a littl while yet gain what they could now sinc they knew that the architect would have had to den soon after dark to keep from travel in a circl,he wa tell some more of it wa lead into what he wa tell yet still without tell how he got to where he wa nor even how what he wa now involv in came to occur he wa obvious at least twenti year old at the time he wa tell about crouch behind a window in the dark and fire the musket through it which someon els load and hand to him get himself and grandfath both into that besieg haitian room as simpli as he got himself to the west indi by say that he decid to go to the west indi and so he went there,faulkner
5603,5604,thi anecdot wa no deliber continu of the other one but wa mere call to hi mind by the pictur of the nigger and torch in front of them he not tell how he got there what had happen dure the six year between that day when he had decid to go to the west indi and becom rich and thi night when overs or foreman or someth to a french sugar planter he wa barricad in the hous with the planter s famili,and now grandfath said there wa the first shadow that almost emerg for a moment and then fade again but not complet it s a girl shreve said,faulkner
5605,5606,dont tell me,just go on,faulkner
5607,5608,whom he wa to tell grandfath thirti year afterward he had found unsuit to hi purpos and so put asid though provid for her and there were a few frighten halfbre servant with them who he would have to turn from the window from time to time and kick and curs into help the girl load the musket which he and the planter fire through the window,and i reckon grandfath wa say wait wait for god s sake wait about like you are until he final did stop and back up and start over again with at least some regard for caus and effect even if none for logic sequenc and continu,faulkner
5609,5610,or mayb it wa the fact that they were sit again now have decid that they had gone far enough for that night and the nigger had made camp and cook supper and they he and grandfath drank some of the whiskey and ate and then sat befor the fire drink some more of the whiskey and he tell it all over and still it wa not absolut how and the whi he wa there and what he he wa not talk about himself,he wa tell a stori,faulkner
5611,5612,he wa not brag about someth he had done he wa just tell a stori about someth a man name thoma sutpen had experienc which would still have been the same stori if the man had had no name at all if it had been told about ani man or no man over whiskey at night,that may have been what slow him down,faulkner
5613,5614,but it wa not enough to clarifi the stori much,he still wa not recount to grandfath the career of somebodi name thoma sutpen,faulkner
5615,5616,so he learn the languag just like he learn to be a sailor i reckon becaus grandfath ask him whi he did nt get himself a girl to live with and learn it the easi way and grandfath said how he sat here with the firelight on hi face and the beard and hi eye quiet and sort of bright and grandfath said it wa the onli time he ever knew him to say anyth quiet and simpl on thi night i am speak of and until my first marriag i might add i wa still a virgin,you will probabl not believ that and if i were to tri to explain it you would disbeliev me more than ever,faulkner
5617,5618,so i will onli say that that too wa a part of the design which i had in my mind and grandfath said whi should nt i believ it,and he look at grandfath still with that quiet bright express about the eye say but do you,faulkner
5619,5620,sure you do nt hold me in such small contempt as to believ that at twenti i could neither have suffer temptat nor offer it,and grandfath said you re right,faulkner
5621,5622,i should nt believ it,but i do,faulkner
5623,5624,becaus he wa not afraid until after it wa all over grandfath said becaus that wa all it wa to spectacl someth to be watch becaus he might not have a chanc to see it again sinc hi innoc still function and he not onli did not know what fear wa until afterward he did not even know that at first he wa not terrifi did not even know that he had found the place where money wa to he had quick if you were courag and shrewd he did not mean shrewd grandfath said,what he meant wa unscrupul onli he did nt know that word becaus it would not have been in the book from which the school teacher read,faulkner
5625,5626,he told grandfath how until that first night of the sieg he had not onc thought that he did not know the girl s christian name whether he had ever heard it or not,he also told grandfath drop thi into the tell as you might flick the joker out of a pack of fresh card without be abl to rememb later whether you had remov the joker or not that the old man s wife had been a spaniard and so it wa grandfath and not sutpen who realiz that until that first night of the attack he had possibl not seen the girl as much as a dozen time,faulkner
5627,5628,the bodi of one of the halfbre wa found at last sutpen found it hunt for it for two day without even know that what he wa meet wa a blank wall of black secret face a wall behind which almost anyth could be prepar to happen and as he learn later almost anyth wa and on the third day he found the bodi where he could not possibl have miss it dure the first hour of the first day if it had been there,all the time he wa speak he wa sit on the log grandfath said tell it make the gestur to tell it with the man grandfath himself had seen fight nake chest to chest with one of hi wild nigger by the light of the camp fire while hi hous wa build and who still fought with them by lantern light in the stabl after he had got at last that wife who would be adjunct to the forward of that design he had in mind and no bone made about the fight either no handshak and gratul while he wash the blood off and don hi shirt becaus at the end of it the nigger would be flat on hi back with hi chest heav and anoth nigger throw water on him,faulkner
5629,5630,and he told how on the eighth night the water gave out and someth had to be done so he put the musket down and went out and subdu them,that wa how he told it he went out and subdu them and when he return he and the girl becam engag to marri and grandfath say wait wait sure enough now say but you did nt even know her you told me that when the sieg began you did nt even know her name and he look at grandfath and said ye,faulkner
5631,5632,but you see it took me some time to recov,not how he did it,faulkner
5633,5634,he did nt tell that either that of no moment to the stori either he just put the musket down and had someon unbar the door and then bar it behind him and walk out into the dark and subdu them mayb by yell louder mayb by stand bear more than they believ ani bone and flesh could or should should ye that would be the terribl thing to find flesh to stand more than flesh should be ask to stand mayb at last they themselv turn in horror and flee from the white arm and leg shape like their and from which blood could be made to spurt and flow as it could from their and contain an indomit spirit which should have come from the same primari fire which their came from but which could not have could not possibl have,he show grandfath the scar one of which grandfath said came pretti near leav him that virgin for the rest of hi life too,faulkner
5635,5636,and then daylight came with no drum in it for the first time in eight day and they emerg probabl the man and the daughter and walk across the burn land with the bright sun shine down on it as if noth had happen walk now in what must have been an incred desol solitud and peac quiet and found him and brought him to the hous and when he recov he and the girl were engag,then he stop,faulkner
5637,5638,all right shreve said,go on,faulkner
5639,5640,i said he stop quentin said,i heard you,faulkner
5641,5642,stop what,how got engag and then stop yet still had a wife to repudi later,faulkner
5643,5644,you said he did nt rememb how he got to haiti and then he did nt rememb how he got into the hous with the nigger surround it,now are you go to tell me he did nt even rememb get marri,faulkner
5645,5646,that he got engag and then he decid he would stop onli one day he found out he had nt stop but on the contrari he wa marri,and all you call him wa just a virgin,faulkner
5647,5648,he stop talk tell it quentin said,he had not move talk appar if to anyth to the letter lie on the open book on the tabl between hi hand,faulkner
5649,5650,opposit him shreve had fill the pipe and smoke it out again,it lay again overturn a scatter of white ash fan out from the bowl onto the tabl befor hi cross nake arm with which he appear at the same time both to support and hug himself sinc although it wa onli eleven oclock the room wa begin to cool toward that point where about midnight there would be onli enough heat in the radiat to keep the pipe from freez though he would not perform hi deepbreath in the open window tonight at all he had yet to go to the bedroom and return first with hi bathrob on and next with hi overcoat on top of the bathrob and quentin s overcoat on hi arm,faulkner
5651,5652,he just said that he wa now engag to be marri quentin said and then he stop tell it,he just stop grandfath said flat and final like that like that wa all there wa all there could be to it all of it that made good listen from one man to anoth over whiskey at night,faulkner
5653,5654,mayb it wa,hi quentin s face wa lower,faulkner
5655,5656,he spoke still in that curiou that almost sullen flat tone which had caus shreve to watch him from the begin with intent detach specul and curios to watch him still from behind hi shreve s express of cherub and erudit amaz which the spectacl intensifi or perhap actual creat,sutpen just got up and look at the whiskey bottl and said no more tonight,faulkner
5657,5658,we ll get to sleep we want to get an earli start tomorrow,mayb we can catch him befor he limber up,faulkner
5659,5660,but they did nt,it wa late afternoon befor they caught him the architect i then onli becaus he had hurt hi leg tri to architect himself across the river,faulkner
5661,5662,but he made a mistak in the calcul thi time so the dog and the nigger bay him and the nigger make the racket now as they haul him out,grandfath said how mayb the nigger believ that by flee the architect had voluntarili surrend hi statu as interdict meat had voluntarili offer the gambit by flee which the nigger had accept by chase him and won by catch him and that now they would be allow to cook and eat him both victor and vanquish accept thi in the same spirit of sport and sportsmanship and no rancor or hard feel on either side,faulkner
5663,5664,all the men who had start the race yesterday had come back except three and the one that return had brought other so there were more of them now than when the race start grandfath said,so they haul him out of hi cave under the river bank a littl man with one sleev miss from hi frock coat and hi flower vest ruin by water and mud where he had fallen in the river and one pant leg rip down so they could see where he had tie up hi leg with a piec of hi shirt tail and the rag bloodi and the leg swollen and hi hat wa complet gone,faulkner
5665,5666,they never did find it so grandfath gave him a new hat the day he left when the hous wa finish,but it sound fine grandfath said even of tell that the architect wa not apolog it wa fine grandfath said and he said how sutpen turn toward him but he grandfath wa alreadi approach the architect hold out the bottl of whiskey alreadi uncork,faulkner
5667,5668,quentin ceas,at onc shreve said all right,faulkner
5669,5670,dont bother to say he stop talk now just go on,just do nt bother shreve said,faulkner
5671,5672,just get on with it,that would take thirti year quentin said,faulkner
5673,5674,it wa thirti year befor sutpen told grandfath ani more of it,mayb he wa too busi,faulkner
5675,5676,i do nt know quentin said,nobodi ever did know for certain,faulkner
5677,5678,it wa someth about a bill of lade some way he persuad mr coldfield to use hi credit one of those thing that when they work you were smart and when they do nt you chang your name and move to texa and father said how mr coldfield must have sat back there in hi littl store and watch hi wagonload of stock doubl mayb everi ten year or at least not lose ani ground and seen the chanc to do that veri same thing all the time onli hi conscienc not hi courag father said he had plenti of that would nt let him,then sutpen came along and offer to do it he and mr coldfield to divid the loot if it work and he sutpen to take all the blame if it did nt,faulkner
5679,5680,and mr coldfield let him,father said it wa becaus mr coldfield did not believ it would work that they would get away with it onli he could nt quit think about it and so when they tri it and it fail he mr coldfield would be abl to get it out of hi mind then and that when it did fail and they were caught mr coldfield would insist on take hi share of the blame as penanc and expiat for have sin in hi mind all those year,faulkner
5681,5682,that s fine,but sutpen,faulkner
5683,5684,the design,get on now,faulkner
5685,5686,ye quentin said,the design,faulkner
5687,5688,richer and richer,it must have look fine and clear ahead for him now hous finish and even bigger and whiter than the one he had gone to the door of that day and the nigger came in hi monkey cloth and told him to go to the back and he with hi own brand of nigger even which the man who lay in the hammock with hi shoe off did nt have to cull one from and train him to go to the door when hi turn came for a littl boy without ani shoe on and with hi pap s cutdown pant for cloth to come and knock on it,faulkner
5689,5690,but go on,sutpen s children,faulkner
5691,5692,go on,ye quentin said,faulkner
5693,5694,the two children think ye,mayb we are both father,faulkner
5695,5696,mayb noth ever happen onc and is finish,mayb happen is never onc but like rippl mayb on water after the pebbl sink the rippl move on spread the pool attach by a narrow umbil watercord to the next pool which the first pool feed ha fed did feed let thi second pool contain a differ temperatur of water a differ molecular of have seen felt rememb reflect in a differ tone the infinit unchang sky it doe nt matter that pebbl s wateri echo whose fall it did not even see move across it surfac too at the origin ripplespac to the old ineradic rhythm think ye we are both father,faulkner
5697,5698,or mayb father and i are both shreve mayb it took father and me both to make shreve or shreve and me both to make father or mayb thoma sutpen to make all of us,ye the two children the son and the daughter by sex and age so glib to the design that he might have plan that too by charact mental and physic so glib to it that he might have cull them out of the celesti herd of seraph and cherubim like he chose hi twenti nigger out of whatev swap there must have been when he repudi that first wife and that child when he discov that they would not be adjunct to the forward of the design,faulkner
5699,5700,sit there in grandfath s offic tri to explain with that patient amaz recapitul not to grandfath and not to himself becaus grandfath said that hi veri calm wa indic that he had long sinc given up ani hope of ever understand it but tri to explain to circumst to fate itself the logic step by which he had arriv at a result absolut and forev incred repeat the clear and simpl synopsi of hi histori which he and grandfath both now knew as if he were tri to explain it to an intract and unpredict child you see i had a design in my mind,whether it wa a good or a bad design is besid the point the question is where did i make the mistak in it what did i do or misdo in it whom or what injur by it to the extent which thi would indic,faulkner
5701,5702,i had a design,to accomplish it i should requir money a hous a plantat slave a of cours a wife,faulkner
5703,5704,i set out to acquir these ask no favor of ani man,i even risk my life at one time as i told you though as i also told you i did not undertak thi risk pure and simpli to gain a wife though it did have that result,faulkner
5705,5706,but that is besid the point also suffic that i had the wife accept her in good faith with no reserv about myself and i expect as much from them,i did not even demand mind as one of my obscur origin might have been expect to do or at least be condon in the do out of ignor of gentil in deal with gentleborn peopl,faulkner
5707,5708,i did not demand i accept them at their own valuat while insist on my own part upon explain fulli about myself and my progenitor yet they deliber withheld from me the one fact which i have reason to know they were awar would have caus me to declin the entir matter otherwis they would not have withheld it from fact which i did not learn until after my son wa born,and even then i did not act hastili,faulkner
5709,5710,i could have remind them of these wast year these year which would now leav me behind with my schedul not onli the amount of elaps time which their number repres but that compensatori amount of time repres by their number which i should now have to spend to advanc myself onc more to the point i had reach and lost,but i did not,faulkner
5711,5712,i mere explain how thi new fact render it imposs that thi woman and child be incorpor in my design and follow which as i told you i made no attempt to keep not onli that which i might consid myself to have earn at the risk of my life but which had been given to me by sign testimoni but on the contrari i declin and resign all right and claim to thi in order that i might repair whatev injustic i might be consid to have done by so provid for the two person whom i might be consid to have depriv of anyth i might later possess and thi wa agre to mind agre to between the two parti,and yet and after more than thirti year more than thirti year after my conscienc had final assur me that if i had done an injustic i had done what i could to rectifi and grandfath not say wait now but say holler mayb even conscienc,faulkner
5713,5714,conscienc,good god man what els did you expect,faulkner
5715,5716,did nt the veri affin and instinct for misfortun of a man who had spent that much time in a monasteri even let alon one who had live that mani year as you live them tell you better than that,did nt the dread and fear of femal which you must have drawn in with the primari mammalian milk teach you better,faulkner
5717,5718,what kind of abysm and purblind innoc could that have been which someon told you to call virgin,what conscienc to trade with which would have warrant you in the belief that you could have bought immun from her for no other coin but justic,faulkner
5719,5720,it wa at thi point that shreve went to the bedroom and put on the bathrob,he did not say wait he just rose and left quentin sit befor the tabl the open book and the letter and went out and return in the robe and sat again and took up the cold pipe though without fill it anew or light it as it wa,faulkner
5721,5722,all right he said,so that christma henri brought him home into the hous and the demon look up and saw the face he believ he had paid off and discharg twentyeight year ago,faulkner
5723,5724,go on,ye quentin said,faulkner
5725,5726,father said he probabl name him himself,charl bon,faulkner
5727,5728,charl good,he did nt tell grandfath that he did but grandfath believ he did would have,faulkner
5729,5730,that would have been a part of the clean up just as he would have done hi share toward clean up the explod cap and musket cartridg after the sieg if he had nt been sick or mayb engag he would have insist on it mayb the conscienc again which could not allow her and the child ani place in the design even though he could have close hi eye and if not fool the rest of the world as they had fool him at least have frighten ani man out of speak the secret same conscienc which would not permit the child sinc it wa a boy to bear either hi name or that of it matern grandfath yet which would also forbid him to do the customari and provid a quick husband for the discard woman and so give hi son an authent name,he chose the name himself grandfath believ just as he name them charl good and the clytemnestra and henri and judith and all of entir fecund of dragon teeth as father call it,faulkner
5731,5732,he seem to have got an aw lot of delay inform aw quick after have wait fortyf year,if he knew all thi what wa hi reason for tell you that the troubl between henri and bon wa the octoroon woman,faulkner
5733,5734,he did nt know it then,grandfath did nt tell him all of it either like sutpen never told grandfath quit all of it,faulkner
5735,5736,then who did tell him,i did,faulkner
5737,5738,quentin did not move did not look up while shreve watch him,after you and the old aunt,faulkner
5739,5740,i see,go on,faulkner
5741,5742,and he not call it retribut no sin of the father come home to roost not even call it bad luck but just a mistak that mistak which he could not discov himself and which he came to grandfath not to excus but just to review the fact for an imparti and grandfath said he believ a legal train mind to examin and find and point out to him,not moral retribut you see just an old mistak in fact which a man of courag and shrewd the one of which he now knew he possess the other of which he believ hat he had now learn acquir could still combat if he could onli find out what the mistak had been,faulkner
5743,5744,becaus he did not give up,he never did give up grandfath said that hi subsequ action the fact that for a time he did noth and so perhap help to bring about the veri situat which he dread were not the result of ani fail of courag or shrewd or ruthless but were the result of hi convict that it had all come from a mistak and until he discov what that mistak had been he did not intend to risk make anoth one,faulkner
5745,5746,so he invit bon into the hous and for the two week of the vacat onli it did nt take that long father said that probabl mr sutpen had judith and bon alreadi engag from the moment she saw bon s name in henri s first letter he watch bon and henri and judith or watch bon and judith rather becaus he would have alreadi known about henri and bon from henri s letter about him from the school watch them for two week and did noth,then henri and bon went back to school and now the nigger groom that fetch the mail back and forth each week between oxford and sutpen s hundr brought letter to judith now that were not in henri s hand and that not necessari either father said becaus mr sutpen wa alreadi cover the town and counti both with news of that engag that father said did nt exist yet and still he did noth,faulkner
5747,5748,he did nt do anyth at all until spring wa almost over and henri wrote that he wa bring bon home with him to stay a day or two befor bon went home,then sutpen went to new orlean,faulkner
5749,5750,but it did nt work evid and the next christma came and henri and bon came to sutpen s hundr again and now sutpen saw that there wa no help for it that judith wa in love with bon and whether bon want reveng or wa just caught and sunk and doom too it wa all the same,so it seem that he sent for henri that christma eve just befor supper time father said that mayb by now after hi new orlean trip he had learn at last enough about women to know it would nt do ani good to go to judith first and told henri,faulkner
5751,5752,and he knew what henri would say and henri said it and he took the lie from hi son and henri knew by hi father take the lie that what hi father had told him wa true and father said that he sutpen probabl knew what henri would do too and count on henri do it becaus he still believ that it had been onli a minor tactic mistak,so he wa like a skirmish who is outnumb yet can not retreat who believ that if he is just patient enough and clever enough and calm enough and alert enough he can get the enemi scatter and pick them off one by one,faulkner
5753,5754,and henri did it,and he sutpen probabl knew what henri would do next too that henri too would go to new orlean to find out for himself,faulkner
5755,5756,then it wa and sutpen knew what they would do now not onli what henri would do but what he would forc bon to do mayb be a it would not requir a demon to forese war now he even foresaw that henri and bon would join that student compani at the univers he may have had some way of watch know the day their name appear on the roster some way of know where the compani wa even befor grandfath becam colonel of the regiment the compani wa in until he got hurt at pittsburgh land where bon wa wound and came home to get use to not have ani right arm and sutpen came home in with the two tombston and talk to grandfath in the offic that day befor both of them went back to the war,that wa the day he came to the offic the demon s shreve said day of leav at home came home with hi tombston,faulkner
5757,5758,now fogbound by hi own privat embattl of person moral that picayun split of abstract hair while grandfath said rome vanish and jericho crumbl that thi would be right if or that would be wrong but of slow blood and stiffen bone and arteri that father say men resort to in senil who while young and suppl and strong react to a singl simpl ye and a singl simpl no as instantan and complet and unthink as the snap on and off of electr sit there and talk and now grandfath not know what he wa talk about becaus now grandfath said he did not believ that sutpen himself knew becaus even yet sutpen had not quit told him all of it,and thi that moral again grandfath said that moral which would not permit him to malign or traduc the memori of hi first wife or at least the memori of the marriag even though he felt that he had been trick by it not even to an acquaint in whose confid and discret he trust enough to wish to justifi himself not even to hi son by anoth marriag in order to preserv the statu of hi life s attain and desir except as a last resort,faulkner
5759,5760,not that he would hesit then grandfath said but not until then,he had been trick by it himself but he had extric himself without ask or receiv help from ani man let anyon els who might be so impos upon do the same,faulkner
5761,5762,i chose and i made to the fullest what aton lay in my power for whatev injuri i might have done in choos pay even more for the privileg of choos as i chose than i might have been expect to or even by law requir,when your grandfath wa tell thi to him he did nt know ani more what your grandfath wa talk about than your grandfath knew what the demon wa talk about when the demon told it to him did he,faulkner
5763,5764,and when your old man told it to you you would nt have known what anybodi wa talk about if you had nt been out there and seen clyti,is that right,faulkner
5765,5766,ye quentin said,grandfath wa the onli friend he had,faulkner
5767,5768,the demon had,quentin did nt answer did nt move,faulkner
5769,5770,it wa cold in the room now,the heat wa almost gone out of the radiat the cold iron flute stern signal and admonit for sleep the littl death the renew,faulkner
5771,5772,it had been some time now sinc the chime had rung eleven,all right shreve said,faulkner
5773,5774,he wa hug himself into the bathrob now as he had formerli hug himself insid hi pink nake almost hairless skin,he chose,faulkner
5775,5776,he chose lecheri,so do i but go on,faulkner
5777,5778,hi remark wa not intend for flippanc nor even derog,it wa born if from ani sourc of that incorrig unsentiment sentiment of the young which take the form of hard and often crass to which by the way quentin paid no attent whatev resum as if he had never been interrupt hi face still lower still brood appar on the open letter upon the open book between hi hand,faulkner
5779,5780,he left for virginia that night,grandfath saw him approach the holston hous and saw old mr mccaslin and two other old men hobbl out and stop him he sit the stallion and talk to them and hi voic not rais grandfath said yet the veri sober qualiti of hi gestur and the set of hi shoulder forens orator,faulkner
5781,5782,then he went on,he could still reach sutpen s hundr befor dark so it wa probabl after supper that he head the stallion toward the atlant ocean he and judith face one anoth again for mayb a full minut he not need to say i will stop it if i can she not need to say stop it then if you can but just goodby the kiss on the brow and no tear a word to clyti and to wash master to slave baron to retain well clyti take care of miss judith,faulkner
5783,5784,wash i ll send you a piec of abe lincoln s coat tail from washington and i reckon wash answer like it use to be under the scuppernong with the demijohn and the well bucket sho kernel kill ever one of the varmint,so he ate the hoecak and drank the parch acorn coffe and rode away,faulkner
5785,5786,then it wa and the armi grandfath had gone back to it too he wa a brigadi now though i reckon thi wa for more reason than becaus he just had one arm had retreat across georgia and into carolina and they all knew it would nt be veri much longer now,then one day lee sent johnston some reinforc from one of hi corp and grandfath found out that the twentythird mississippi wa one of the regiment,faulkner
5787,5788,and he grandfath did nt know what had happen whether sutpen had found out in some way that henri had at last coerc hi conscienc into agre with him as hi henri s father had done thirti year ago whether judith perhap had written her father that she had heard from bon at last and what she and bon intend to do or if the four of them had just reach as one person that point where someth had to be done had to happen he grandfath did nt know,he just learn one morn that sutpen had ridden up to grandfath s old regiment s headquart and ask and receiv permiss to speak to henri and did speak to him and then rode away again befor midnight,faulkner
5789,5790,so he got hi choic made after all shreve said,he play that trump after all,faulkner
5791,5792,ye,henri kill him follow by the brief tear which ceas on the instant when they began as if the moistur consist of a singl sheet or layer thin as a cigarett paper and in the shape of a human face the ah clyti,faulkner
5793,5794,ah rosa,wash,faulkner
5795,5796,i wa unabl to penetr far enough behind the yanke line to cut a piec from that coat tail as i promis you the from jone guffaw the chortl the old imbecil stabil of the articul mud which mr compson said outlast the victori and the defeat both well kernel they kilt us but they aint whup us yit air they,and that wa all,faulkner
5797,5798,he had return,he wa home again where hi problem now wa hast pass time the need to hurri,faulkner
5799,5800,he wa not concern mr compson said about the courag and the will nor even about the shrewd now,he wa not for one moment concern about hi abil to start the third time,faulkner
5801,5802,all that he wa concern about wa the possibl that he might not have time suffici to do it in regain hi lost ground in,he did not wast ani of what time he had either,faulkner
5803,5804,becaus he seem to perceiv without stop in that passag through the hous which wa an unbroken continu of the long journey from virginia the paus not to greet hi famili but mere to pick up jone and drag him on out to the brierchok field and fallen fenc and clap ax or mattock into hi hand the one weak spot the one spot vulner to assault in miss rosa s embattl spinsterhood and to assault and carri thi in one stride with someth of the ruthless tactic skill of hi old master the twentythird mississippi wa in jackson s corp at one time,and then the shrewd fail him again,faulkner
5805,5806,it broke down it vanish into that old impot logic and moral which had betray him befor and what day might it have been what furrow might he have stop dead in on foot advanc the unsenti plow handl in hi instantan unsenti hand what fenc panel held in midair as though it had no weight by muscl which could not rid it when he realiz that there wa more in hi problem than just lack of time that the problem contain some superdistil of thi lack that he wa now past sixti and that possibl he could get but one more son had at best but one more son in hi loin as the old cannon might know when it ha just one more shot in it corpor,so he suggest what he suggest to her and she did what he should have known she would do and would have known probabl if he had not bog himself again in hi moral which had all the part but which refus to run to move,faulkner
5807,5808,henc the propos the outrag and unbelief the tide the blast of indign and anger upon which miss rosa vanish from sutpen s hundr her airballoon skirt spread upon the flood chiplight her bonnet possibl one of ellen s which she had prowl out of the attic clap fast onto her head rigid and precari with rage,and he stand there with the rein over hi arm with perhap someth like smile insid hi beard and about the eye which wa not smile but the crinkl concentr of furiou hast the need for it the urgenc but not fear not concern just the fact that he had miss that time though luckili it wa just a spot shot with a light charg and the old gun the old barrel and carriag none the wors onli next time there might not be enough powder for both a spot shot and then a fullsiz fact that the thread of shrewd and courag and will ran onto the same spool which the thread of hi remain day ran onto and that spool almost near enough for him to reach out hi hand and touch it,faulkner
5809,5810,but thi wa no grave concern yet sinc it the old logic the old moral which had never yet fail to fail him wa alreadi fall into pattern alreadi show him conclus that he had been right just as he knew he had been and therefor what had happen wa just a delus and did not actual exist,no shreve said you wait,faulkner
5811,5812,let me play a while now,now wash,faulkner
5813,5814,him the demon stand there with the hors the saddl charger the sheath saber the gray wait to be laid peac away among the moth and all lost save dishonor then the voic of the faith gravedigg who open the play and would close it come out of the wing like shakespear s veri self well kernel they mought have whup us but they aint kilt us yit air they,wa not flippanc either,faulkner
5815,5816,there wa no harm intend by shreve and no harm taken sinc quentin did not even stop,he did not even falter take shreve up in stride without comma or colon or paragraph reserv to risk a spot shot with now so he start thi one like you start a rabbit out of a brier patch with a littl chunk of dri mud thrown by hand,faulkner
5817,5818,mayb it wa the first string of bead out of hi and wash s littl store where he would get mad at hi custom the nigger and the trash and the haggl and turn them out and lock the door and drink himself blind,and mayb wash deliv the bead himself father said that wa down at the gate when he rode back from the war that day that after he went away with the regiment would tell folk that he wash wa look after kernel s place and nigger until after a while mayb he even believ it,faulkner
5819,5820,father s mother said how when the sutpen nigger first heard about what he wa say they would stop him in the road that came up out of the bottom where the old fish camp wa that sutpen let him and the granddaught she wa about eight then live in,there would be too mani of them for him to whip them all to even tri to risk tri to and they would ask him whi he wa nt at the war and he would say git outen my road nigger,faulkner
5821,5822,and then it would be the outright laugh ask one anoth except it wa not one anoth but him who him call us nigger,and he would rush at them with a stick and them avoid him just enough not mad at all just laugh,faulkner
5823,5824,and he wa still carri fish and anim he kill or mayb stole and veget up to the hous when that wa about all mr sutpen and judith and clyti too had to live on and clyti would not let him come into the kitchen with the basket even say stop right there white man stop right where you is,you aint never cross thi door while colonel wa here and you aint go to cross it now,faulkner
5825,5826,which wa true onli father said there wa a kind of pride in it that he had never tri to enter the hous even though he believ that if he had tri sutpen would not have let them repuls him like father said he might have said to himself the reason i wo nt tri it aint that i refus to give ani black nigger the chanc to tell me i cant but becaus i aint go to forc mister tom to have to cuss a nigger or take a cuss from hi vile on my account,if god himself wa to come down and rid the natur earth that s what he would aim to look like,faulkner
5827,5828,mayb he even deliv the first string of bead himself and father said mayb each of the ribbon afterward dure the next three year while the girl matur fast like girl of that kind do or anyway he would know and recogn each and everi ribbon when he saw it on her even when she lie to him about where and how she got it which she probabl did not sinc she would be bound to know that he had been see the ribbon in the showcas everi day for three year and would have known them as well as he knew hi own shoe,and not onli he knew them but all the other men the custom and the lounger the white and the black that would be sit and squat about the store s galleri to watch her pass not quit defiant and not quit cring and not quit flaunt the ribbon and the bead but almost not quit ani of them but a littl of all bold sullen and fear,faulkner
5829,5830,but father said how wash s heart wa probabl still quiet even after he saw the dress and spoke about it probabl onli a littl grave now and watch her secret defiant frighten face while she told him befor he had ask mayb too insist too quick to volunt it that miss judith had given it to her help her to make it and father said mayb he realiz all of a sudden and without warn that when he pass the men on the galleri they would look after him too and that they alreadi knew that which he had just thought they were probabl think,but father said hi heart wa still quiet even now and that he answer if he answer at all stop the protest and disclaim at all sho now,faulkner
5831,5832,ef kernel and miss judith want to give hit to you i hope you mind to thank them,alarm father said just thought just grave and father said how that afternoon grandfath rode out to see sutpen about someth and there wa nobodi in the front of the store and he wa about to go out and go up to the hous when he heard the voic from the back and he walk on toward them and so he overheard them befor he could begin to not listen and befor he could make them hear him call sutpen s name,faulkner
5833,5834,grandfath could nt see them yet he had nt even got to where they could hear him yet but he said he knew exactli how they would be sutpen have alreadi told wash to get the jug out and then wash spoke and sutpen begin to turn realiz that wash wa nt get the jug befor he comprehend the import of what wash wa say then comprehend that and still half turn and then all of a sudden kind of rear back and fling hi head up look at wash and wash stand there not cring either in that attitud dog and quiet and not cring and sutpen said what about the dress,and grandfath said it wa sutpen s voic that wa short and sharp not wash s that wash s voic wa just flat and quiet not abject just patient and slow i have know you for go on twenti year now,faulkner
5835,5836,i aint never deni yit to do what you told me to do,and i m a man past sixti,faulkner
5837,5838,and she aint noth but a fifteenyearold gal,and sutpen said mean that i d harm the girl,faulkner
5839,5840,i a man as old as you are,and wash if you wa arra other man i d say you wa as old as me,faulkner
5841,5842,and old or no old i would nt let her keep that dress nor noth els that come from your hand,but you are differ,faulkner
5843,5844,and sutpen how differ,and grandfath said how wash did not answer and that he call again now and neither of them heard him and then sutpen said so that s whi you are afraid of me,faulkner
5845,5846,and wash said i aint afraid,becaus you are brave,faulkner
5847,5848,it aint that you were a brave man at one second or minut or hour of your life and got a paper to show hit from gener lee,but you are brave the same as you are aliv and breath,faulkner
5849,5850,that s where it s differ,hit do nt need no ticket from nobodi to tell me that,faulkner
5851,5852,and i know that whatev your hand tech whether hit s a regiment of men or a ignor gal or just a hound dog that you will make hit right,then grandfath heard sutpen move sudden and sharp and grandfath said he reckon thought just about what he imagin wash wa think,faulkner
5853,5854,but all sutpen said wa get the jug,sho kernel wash said,faulkner
5855,5856,so that sunday came a year after that day and three year after he had suggest to miss rosa that they tri it first and if it wa a boy and live they would be marri,it wa befor daylight and he wa expect hi mare to foal to the black stallion so when he left the hous befor day that morn judith thought he wa go to the stabl,faulkner
5857,5858,so it wa not until he fail to return at dinner time that she went or sent clyti to the stabl and found that the mare had foal in the night but that her father wa not there,and it wa not until midafternoon that she found a halfgrown boy and paid him a nickel to go down to the old fish camp and ask wash where sutpen wa and the boy walk whistl around the corner of the rot cabin and saw mayb the scyth first mayb the bodi first lie in the weed which wash had not yet cut and as he scream he look up and saw wash in the window watch him,faulkner
5859,5860,then about a week later they caught the nigger the midwif and she told how she did nt know that wash wa there at all that dawn when she heard the hors and then sutpen s feet and he came in and stood over the pallet where the girl and the babi were and said that wa the mare thi morn,a damn fine colt,faulkner
5861,5862,go to be the spit and imag of hi daddi when i rode him north in,do you rememb,faulkner
5863,5864,and the old nigger said she said ye marster and that he jerk the ride whip toward the pallet and said well,damn your black hide hors or mare,faulkner
5865,5866,and that she told him and that he stood there for a minut and he did nt move at all with the ride whip against hi leg and the lattic of sunlight from the unchink wall fall upon him across hi white hair and hi beard that had nt turn at all yet and she said she saw hi eye and then hi teeth insid hi beard and that she would have run then onli she could nt could nt seem to make her leg bear to get up and run and then he look at the girl on the pallet again and said well milli too bad you re not a mare too,then i could give you a decent stall in the stabl and turn and went out,faulkner
5867,5868,onli she could not move even yet and she did nt even know that wash wa outsid there she just heard sutpen say stand back wash,do nt you touch me and then wash hi voic soft and hardli loud enough to reach her i m go to tech you kernel and sutpen again stand back wash,faulkner
5869,5870,and father said hi heart wa quiet then too even though he knew what they would be say in everi cabin about the land by nightfal just as he had known what they were say dure the last four or five month while hi granddaught s condit which he had never tri to conceal could no longer be mistaken wash jone ha fix old sutpen at last,and how could i have live nigh to him for twenti year without be touch and chang by him,faulkner
5871,5872,mayb i am not as big as he is and mayb i did not do ani of the gallop,but at least i wa drug along where he went,faulkner
5873,5874,i just know i kaint think that wa what got him up,it wa that colt,faulkner
5875,5876,it aint me or mine either,it wa nt even hi own that got him out of bed mayb feel no earth no stabil even yet mayb not even hear hi own voic when sutpen saw hi face the face of the man who in twenti year he had no more known to make ani move save at command than he had the stallion which he rode and stop you said if she wa a mare you could give her a decent stall in the stabl mayb not even hear sutpen when he said sudden and sharp stand back,faulkner
5877,5878,dont you touch me onli he must have heard that becaus he answer it i m go to tech you kernel and sutpen said stand back wash again befor the old woman heard the whip,onli there were two blow with the whip they found the two welt on wash s face that night,faulkner
5879,5880,whut racket honey,and mayb he tri to persuad her to eat side meat he had probabl brought home from the store saturday night or mayb the candi tri to tempt her with it nickel s worth of stale jellifi glue out of a stripe sack and mayb ate and then sat at the window where he could look out abov the bodi and the scyth in the weed below and watch the road,faulkner
5881,5882,becaus he wa sit there when the halfgrown boy came around the corner of the hous whistl and saw him,it would probabl be about sunset now and probabl he could feel them quit near now father said it probabl seem to him that he could even hear them all the voic the murmur of tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow beyond the immedi furi old wash jone come a tumbl at last,faulkner
5883,5884,he thought he had sutpen but sutpen fool him,he thought he had him but old wash jone got fool and then mayb even say it aloud shout it father said but i never expect that kernel,faulkner
5885,5886,you know i never,until mayb the granddaught stir and spoke querul again and he went and quiet her and return to talk to himself again but care now quiet now sinc sutpen wa close enough to hear him easi without shout you know i never,faulkner
5887,5888,you know i never expect or ask or want noth from ani live man but what i expect from you,and i never ask that,faulkner
5889,5890,i did nt think hit would need i just said to myself i do nt need to,what need ha a fellow like wash jone to question or doubt the man that gener lee himself said in a handwrot ticket that he wa brave,faulkner
5891,5892,brave and mayb it would be loud again forget again brave,better if narra one of them had ever rid back in think better if hi kind and mine too had never drawn the breath of life on thi earth,faulkner
5893,5894,better that all who remain of us be blast from the face of it than that anoth wash jone should see hi whole life shred from him and shrivel away like a dri shuck thrown onto the fire then they rode up,he must have been listen to them as they came down the road the dog and the hors and seen the lantern sinc it wa dark now,faulkner
5895,5896,and mayor de spain who wa sheriff then got down and saw the bodi though he said he did not see wash nor know that he wa there until wash spoke hi name quietli from the window almost in hi face that you mayor,de spain told him to come on out and he said how wash s voic wa quit quiet when he said he would be out in just a minut it wa too quiet too calm so much too quiet and calm that de spain said he did not realiz for a moment that it wa too calm and quiet in just a minut,faulkner
5897,5898,soon as i see about my granddaught,we ll see to her de spain said,faulkner
5899,5900,you come on out,sho mayor wash said in just a minut,faulkner
5901,5902,so they wait in front of the dark hous and the next day father said there were a hundr that rememb about the butcher knife that he kept hidden and one thing in hi sloven life that he wa ever known to take pride in or care by the time they rememb all thi it wa too late,so they did nt know what he wa about,faulkner
5903,5904,they just heard him move insid the dark hous then they heard the granddaught s voic fret and querul who is it,light the lamp grandpaw then hi voic hit wont need no light honey,faulkner
5905,5906,hit wont take but a minut then de spain drew hi pistol and said you wash,come out of there,faulkner
5907,5908,and still wash did nt answer murmur still to the granddaught wher air you,and the fret voic answer right here,faulkner
5909,5910,where els would i be,what then de spain said jone,faulkner
5911,5912,and he wa alreadi fumbl at the broken step when the granddaught scream and now all the men there claim that they heard the knife on both the neckbon though de spain did nt,he just said he knew that wash had come out onto the galleri and that he sprang back befor he found out that it wa not toward him wash wa run but toward the end of the galleri where the bodi lay but that he did not think about the scyth he just ran backward a few feet when he saw wash stoop and rise again and now wash wa run toward him,faulkner
5913,5914,onli he wa run toward them all de spain said run into the lantern so that now they could see the scyth rais abov hi head they could see hi face hi eye too as he ran with the scyth abov hi head straight into the lantern and the gun barrel make no sound no outcri while de spain ran backward befor him say jone,stop,faulkner
5915,5916,stop or i ll kill you,jone,faulkner
5917,5918,jone,jone,faulkner
5919,5920,wait shreve said,sit in grandfath s offic that afternoon with hi head kind of flung back a littl explain to grandfath like he might have been explain arithmet to henri back in the fourth grade you see all i want wa just a son,faulkner
5921,5922,shreve said,with the son he went to all that troubl to get lie right there behind him in the cabin he would have to taunt the grandfath into kill first him and then the child too,faulkner
5923,5924,quentin said,it wa nt a son,faulkner
5925,5926,it wa a girl,oh shreve said,faulkner
5927,5928,on,let s get out of thi damn icebox and go to bed,faulkner
5929,5930,the window would remain close abov the frozen and empti quad beyond which the window in the opposit wall were with two or three except alreadi dark soon the chime would ring for midnight the note melodi and tranquil faint and clear as glass in the fierc it had quit snow still air,so the old man sent the nigger for henri shreve said,faulkner
5931,5932,and henri came in and the old man said they can not marri becaus he is your brother and henri said you lie like that that quick no space no interv no noth between like when you press the button and get light in the room,and the old man just sat there did nt even move and strike him and so henri did nt say you lie again becaus he knew now it wa so he just said it s not true not i do nt believ it but it s not true becaus he could mayb see the old man s face again now and demon or no it wa a kind of grief and piti not for himself but for henri becaus henri wa just young while he the old man knew that he still had the courag and even all the shrewd shreve stood besid the tabl face quentin again though not seat now,faulkner
5933,5934,in the overcoat button awri over the bathrob he look huge and shapeless like a dishevel bear as he stare at quentin the southern whose blood ran quick to cool more suppl to compens for violent chang of temperatur perhap perhap mere nearer the surfac who sat hunch in hi chair hi hand thrust into hi pocket as if he were tri to hug himself warm between hi arm look somehow fragil and even wan in the lamplight the rosi glow which now had noth of warmth cozi in it while both their breath vapor faintli in the cold room where there wa now not two of them but four the two who breath not individu now yet someth both more and less than twin the heart and blood of youth,shreve wa nineteen a few month younger than quentin,faulkner
5935,5936,he look exactli nineteen he wa one of those peopl whose correct age you never know becaus they look exactli that and so you tell yourself that he or she can not possibl be that becaus he or she look too exactli that not to take advantag of the appear so you never believ implicitli that he or she is either that age which they claim or that which in sheer desper they agre to or which someon els report them to be strong enough and will enough for two for two thousand for all,it would not matter here in cambridg that the time had been winter in that garden too and henc no bloom nor leaf even if there had been someon to walk there and be seen there sinc judg by subsequ event it had been night in the garden also,faulkner
5937,5938,but that did not matter becaus it had been so long ago,it did not matter to them quentin and shreve anyway who could without move as free now of flesh of the father who decre and forbad the son who deni and repudi the lover who acquiesc the belov who wa not bereav and with no tediou transit from hearth and garden to saddl who could be alreadi clatter over the frozen rut of that decemb night and that christma dawn that day of peac and cheer of holli and goodwil and log on the hearth not two of them there and then either but four of them ride the two hors through the iron dark and that not matter either what face and what name they call themselv and were call by so long as the blood blood the immort brief recent intransi blood which could hold honor abov slothi unregret and love abov fat and easi shame,faulkner
5939,5940,and bon did nt know it shreve said,the old man did nt move and thi time henri did nt say you lie he said it s not true and the old man said ask him,faulkner
5941,5942,ask charl then and then henri knew that that wa what hi father had meant all the time and that that wa what he meant himself when he told hi father he lie becaus what the old man said wa nt just he is your brother but he ha known all the time that he is your and your sister s brother,but bon did nt know,faulkner
5943,5944,listen do nt you rememb how your father said it that not one time did old guy the seem to wonder how the other wife manag to find him track him down had never onc seem to wonder what she might have been do all that time the thirti year sinc that day when he paid hi bill with her and got it receipt so he thought and saw with hi own eye that it wa so he thought destroy torn up and thrown to the wind never onc wonder about thi but onli that she had done it could have and would have want to track him down,so it wa nt her that told bon,faulkner
5945,5946,she would nt have want to mayb for the reason that she knew demon would believ she had,or mayb she did nt get around to tell him,faulkner
5947,5948,mayb she just never thought that there could be anyon as close to her as a lone child out of her own bodi who would have to be told how she had been scorn and suffer,or mayb she wa alreadi tell it befor he wa big enough to know word and so by the time he wa big enough to understand what wa be told him she had told it so much and so hard that the word did nt make sens to her anymor either becaus they did nt have to make sens to her and so she had got to the point where when she thought she wa say it she wa quiet and when she thought she wa quiet it wa just the hate and the furi and the unsleep and the unforget,faulkner
5949,5950,or mayb she did nt intend for him to know it then,he cast you and me asid and deni you hi name,faulkner
5951,5952,now go and then sit down and let god finish it pistol or knife or rack destruct or grief or anguish god to call the shot or turn the wheel,he would be too young to curri ani connect fact out of the furi and hate and the tumbl speed not comprehend or care just curiou creat for himself without help sinc who to help him hi own notion of that porto rico or haiti or wherev it wa he understood vagu that he had come from like orthodox children do of heaven or the cabbag patch or wherev it wa that they came from except that hi wa differ in that you were not suppos your mother did nt intend to anyway to ever go back there and mayb when you got as old as she wa you would be horrifi too everi time you found hidden in your thought anyth that just smell or tast like it might be a wish to go back there,faulkner
5953,5954,there wa someth curiou in the way they look at one anoth curiou and quiet and profoundli intent not at all as two young men might look at each other but almost as a youth and a veri young girl might out of virgin sort of hush and nake search each look burden with youth s immemori obsess not with time s drag weight which the old live with but with it fluiditi the bright heel of all the lost moment of fifteen and sixteen,then he got older and got out from under the apron despit her despit him too mayb mayb the both of them and he did nt even care,faulkner
5955,5956,he found out that she wa up to someth and he not onli did nt care he did nt even care that he did nt know what it wa he got older and found out that she had been shape and temper him to be the instrument for whatev it wa her hand wa implac for mayb came to believ or saw that she had trick him into receiv that shape and temper and did nt care about that too becaus probabl by that time he had learn that there were three thing and no more breath pleasur dark and without money there could be no pleasur and without pleasur it would not even be breath but mere protoplasm inhal and collaps of blind unorgan in a dark where light never began,and he had the money becaus he knew that she knew that the money wa the onli thing she could coerc and smooth him into the barrier with when derbi day came so she did nt dare pinch him there and she knew he knew it so that mayb he even blackmail her bought her off that way you give me the jack as i want it and i wont ask whi or what for yet,faulkner
5957,5958,or mayb she wa so busi groom him that she never thought of the money now who probabl never had had much time to rememb it or count it or wonder how much there wa in the interv of the hate and the be mad and so all to check him up about the money would be the lawyer,he bon probabl learn that the first thing that he could go to hi mother and hold the lawyer s feet to the fire anytim like the millionair hors ha onli to come in one time with a littl extra sweat on him and tomorrow he will have a new jock,faulkner
5959,5960,sure that s who it would be the lawyer that lawyer with hi privat mad femal millionair to farm who probabl wa nt interest enough in the money to see whether the check had ani other write on them when she sign lawyer who with bon s mother alreadi plot and plan him sinc befor he could rememb for that day when he should be translat quick into so much rich and rot dirt had alreadi been plow and plant and harvest him and the mother both as if he alreadi wa that lawyer who mayb had the secret drawer in the secret safe and the secret paper in it mayb a chart with color pin stuck into it like gener have in campaign and all the notat in code today sutpen finish rob a drunken indian of a hundr mile of virgin land val,at today came up out of swamp with final plank for hous,faulkner

5985,5986,he need a block,not a tether just a light block of some sort so he cant get insid of anyth that might have a fenc around it and onli him to tri to check it or as much as he dare and not get far becaus he knew too that all bon had to do wa to go to hi mother and the race hors would have a gold eatingtrough if he want it and if the jock wa nt care a new jockey too count up the money figur what he would net at thi normal rate over the next few year and meanwhil crucifi between hi two problem whether mayb what he ought to do wa to wash hi hand of the sutpen angl and clean up what wa left and light out for texa,faulkner
5987,5988,it wa shreve speak though save for the slight differ which the interven degre of latitud had inculc in them differ not in tone or pitch but of turn of phrase and usag of word it might have been either of them and wa in a sens both both think as one the voic which happen to be speak the thought onli the think becom audibl vocal the two of them creat between them out of the ragtag and bobend of old tale and talk peopl who perhap had never exist at all anywher who shadow were shadow not of flesh and blood which had live and die but shadow in turn of what were to one of them at least to shreve shade too quiet as the visibl murmur of their vapor breath,the chime now began to ring for midnight melodi slow and faint beyond the close the snowseal window,faulkner
5989,5990,old sabin who could nt to save her life have told you or the lawyer or bon or anybodi els probabl what she want expect hope for becaus she wa a woman and did nt need to want or hope or expect anyth but just to want and expect and hope and besid your father said that when you have plenti of good strong hate you do nt need hope becaus the hate will be enough to nourish you the old sabin not so old yet but she would have just let herself go in the sens that you keep the engin clean and oil and the best of coal in the bunker but you do nt bother to shine the brightwork or holyston the deck anymor just let herself go on the outsid,so she would nt she would nt worri at all she would just have out the carriag and go to the lawyer bust in in the black dress that look like a section of limp stove pipe and mayb not even a hat but just a shawl over her head so that the onli thing miss would be the mop and the pail bust in and say he s dead,faulkner
5991,5992,i know he is dead and how can he how can he be not mean what the aunt rosa meant where did they find or invent a bullet that could kill him but how can he be allow to die without have to admit that he wa wrong and suffer and regret it,he went away to school at the age of twentyeight,faulkner
5993,5994,and he would nt know nor care about that either which of or wa who decid he should go to school nor whi becaus he had known all the time that hi mother wa up to someth and that the lawyer wa up to someth and he did nt care enough about what either of them wa to tri to find out who knew that the lawyer knew that hi mother wa up to someth but that hi mother did nt know that the lawyer wa up to someth and that it would be all right with the lawyer if hi mother got whatev it wa she want provid he the lawyer got what he want one second befor or at least at the same time,he went away to school he said all right and told the octoroon goodby and went to school who not in all the twentyeight year had ever been told by anyon do as these other do have thi task done at nine a m tomorrow or friday or monday mayb it wa even the octoroon whom they or the lawyer light block not tether which the lawyer had put on him to keep him from get insid of someth which might be found to have a fenc around it later,faulkner
5995,5996,all young men do it,the ceremoni too,faulkner
5997,5998,i did nt set out to get the child but now that i have it s not a bad child either and she watch him glare at him and not be abl to say what she would becaus she had put off too long now say what she could but you,thi is differ and he she would not need to say it,faulkner
5999,6000,he would know becaus he alreadi knew whi she had sent for him even if he did not know and did not care what she had been up to sinc befor he could rememb sinc befor he could take a woman whether in love or not whi not,men seem to have to marri some day sooner or later,faulkner
6001,6002,and thi is one whom i know who make me no troubl,and with the ceremoni that bother alreadi done,faulkner
6003,6004,and as for a littl matter like a spot of negro not need to talk much say much either not need to say i seem to have been born into thi world with so few father that i have too mani brother to outrag and shame while aliv and henc too mani descend to bequeath my littl portion of hurt and harm to dead not that just a littl spot of negro and then to watch the face the desper urgenc and fear then to depart kiss her mayb her hand mayb which would lie in hi and even touch hi lip like a dead hand becaus of the desper cast for thi straw or that mayb as he went out he said she will go to him the lawyer if i were to wait five minut i could see her in the shawl,so probabl by tonight i will be abl to i care to know,faulkner
6005,6006,mayb by night he did mayb befor that if they manag to find him get word to him becaus she went to the lawyer,and it wa right in the lawyer s alley,faulkner
6007,6008,mayb befor she even got start tell it good that gentl white glow began like when you turn up a wick mayb he could even almost see hi hand write on into the space where the daughter,daughter,faulkner
6009,6010,daughter,never had quit show,faulkner
6011,6012,becaus mayb that had been the lawyer s troubl and worri and concern all the time that ever sinc she had made him promis he would never tell bon who hi father wa he had been wait and wonder how to do it sinc mayb he knew that if he were to tell bon bon might believ it or he might not but certainli he would go and tell hi mother that the lawyer had told him and then he the lawyer would be sunk not for ani harm done becaus there would be no harm sinc thi could not alter the situat but for have cross hi paranoiac client,so mayb she wa nt out of the offic good or at least as soon as he had had time to open the safe and look in the secret drawer and make sure that it wa the univers of mississippi that henri hi hand wa write steadi and even into the space where the daughter,faulkner

6025,6026,and he did nt care about that too he just said all right,becaus mayb he knew now that hi mother did nt know and never would know what she want and so he could nt beat her mayb he had learn from the octoroon that you cant beat women anyhow and that if you are wise or dislik troubl and uproar you do nt even tri to and he knew that all the lawyer want wa just the money and so if he just did nt make the mistak of believ that he could beat all of it if he just rememb to be quiet and be alert he could beat some of it,faulkner
6027,6028,never at ani time did there seem to be ani confus between them as to whom shreve meant by he listen courteou and quiet behind that express which you were not suppos to see past ask at last interrupt mayb courteou and affabl noth of ironi noth of what did you say thi colleg wa,and now a good deal of elbow motion here while the lawyer would shuffl through the paper to find the one from which he could read that name which he had been memor ever sinc he first talk to the mother the univers of mississippi at did you say,faulkner
6029,6030,oxford quentin said,and then the paper could be still again becaus he would be talk about a small colleg onli ten year old about how there would nt be anyth to distract him from hi studi there where in a sens wisdom herself would be a virgin or at least not veri secondhand and how he would have a chanc to observ anoth and a provinci section of the countri in which hi high destini wa root grant the outcom of thi war which wa without doubt immin the success conclus of which we all hope for had no doubt of as the man he would be and the econom power he would repres when hi mother pass on and he listen behind that express say then you do nt recommend the law as a vocat,faulkner
6031,6032,and now for just a moment the lawyer would stop but not long mayb not long enough or percept enough for you to call it paus and he would be look at bon too it had nt occur to me that the law might appeal to you said bon neither did practis with a rapier appeal to me while i wa do it,but i can recal at least one occas in my life when i wa glad i had and then the lawyer smooth and easi then by all mean let it be the law,faulkner
6033,6034,your mother will pleas,all right he said not goodby he did nt care,faulkner
6035,6036,mayb he did nt even say goodby to the octoroon to those tear and lament and mayb even the cling the soft despair magnoliacolor arm about hi knee and say three and a half feet abov those boneless steel gyve that express of hi which wa not smile but just someth not to be seen through,becaus you cant beat them you just flee and thank god you can flee can escap from that massi fivefootthick maggotcheesi solidar which overlay the earth in which men and women in coupl are rank and rack like ninepin thank to whatev god for that masculin hipless taper peg which fit light and glib to move where the cartridgechamb hip of women hold them fast goodby all right and one night he walk up the gangplank between the torch and probabl onli the lawyer there to see him off and thi not for godspe but to make sure that he actual took the boat,faulkner
6037,6038,and the new extra nigger open the bag in the stateroom spread the fine cloth and the ladi alreadi gather in the saloon for supper and the men in the bar prepar for it but not he he alon at the rail with a cigar mayb watch the citi drift and wink and glitter and sink away and then all motion ceas the boat suspend immobil and without progress from the star themselv by the two rope of sparkfil smoke stream upward from the stack,and who know what think what sober weigh and discard who had known for year that hi mother wa up to someth that the lawyer wa up to someth and though he knew that wa just money yet he knew that within hi the lawyer s known masculin limit he the lawyer could be almost as danger as the unknown quantiti which wa hi mother and now he twentyeight year old,faulkner
6039,6040,and not onli that but thi particular colleg which he had never heard of which ten year ago did not even exist and know too that it wa the lawyer who had chosen it for sober what intent what almost frown whi,whi,faulkner

6053,6054,it is in hi behalf that i write,no i will not say behalf certainli i shall not let hi ladi mother nor the young gentleman himself suspect that i use that term even to one sir scion of the princip famili of that counti as it is your fortun lot to be,faulkner
6055,6056,inde it were better for me if i had not written at all,but i do i have it is irrevoc now if you discern aught in thi letter which smack of humil take it as come not from the mother and certainli not from the son but from the pen of one whose humbl posit as legal advis and man of busi to the abov describ ladi and young gentleman whose loyalti and gratitud toward one whose generos ha found him i do not confess thi i proclaim it in bread and meat and fire and shelter over a period long enough to have taught him gratitud and loyalti even if he had not known them ha led him into an action whose mean fall behind it intent for the reason that he is onli what he is and profess himself to be not what he would,faulkner
6057,6058,and the youth no,i would want him to be older than me and he no son of a land father want an older brother and the youth ye,faulkner
6059,6060,i do look straight at the other the esoter the sybarit stand the youth now erect thin becaus he wa young hi face scarlet but hi head high and hi eye steadi ye,and i would want him to be just like you and he is that so,faulkner
6061,6062,the whiskey s your side,drink or pass,faulkner
6063,6064,and now shreve said we re go to talk about love,but he did nt need to say that either ani more than he had need to specifi which he meant by he sinc neither of them had been think about anyth els all that had gone befor just so much that had to be overpass and none els present to overpass it but them as someon alway ha to rake the leav up befor you can have the bonfir,faulkner
6065,6066,that wa whi it did not matter to either of them which one did the talk sinc it wa not the talk alon which did it perform and accomplish the overpass but some happi marriag of speak and hear wherein each befor the demand the requir forgav condon and forgot the fault of the both in the creat of thi shade whom they discuss rather exist in and in the hear and sift and discard the fals and conserv what seem true or fit the order to overpass to love where there might be paradox and inconsist but noth fault nor fals,and now love,faulkner
6067,6068,he must have known all about her befor he ever saw she look like her privat hour in that provinci women s world that even men of the famili were not suppos to know a great deal about he must have learn it without even have to ask a singl question,jesu it must have kind of boil out all over him,faulkner
6069,6070,how shall i get rid of him and then the voic the other voic you do nt mean that and he no,i ll come home with you for christma not to see the third inhabit of henri s fairi tale not to see the sister becaus he had not onc thought of her he had mere listen about her but think so at last i shall see him whom it seem i wa bred up never to expect to see whom i had even learn to live without think mayb how he would walk into the hous and see the man who made him and then he would know there would be that flash that instant of indisput recognit between them and he would know for sure and forev think mayb that s all i want,faulkner
6071,6072,he need not even acknowledg me i will let him understand just as quickli that he need not do that that i do not expect that will not be hurt by that just as he will let me know that quickli that i am hi son think mayb mayb again with that express you might call smile but which wa not which wa just someth that even just a clodhopp bastard wa not intend to see beyond i am my mother s son at least i do not seem to know what i want either,becaus he knew exactli what he want it wa just the say of physic touch even though in secret live touch of that flesh warm befor he wa born by the same blood which it had bequeath him to warm hi own flesh with to be bequeath by him in turn to run hot and loud in vein and limb after that first flesh and then hi own were dead,faulkner
6073,6074,so the christma came and he and henri rode the forti mile to sutpen s hundr with henri still talk still keep distend and light and iridesc with steadi breath that fairi balloonvacuum in which the three of them exist live move even mayb in attitud without and the friend and the sister whom the friend had never seen and though henri did not know it had not even thought about yet but onli listen about from behind the more urgent think and henri probabl not even notic that the nearer they came to home the less bon talk had to say on ani subject and mayb even and certainli henri would not know thi listen less,and so he went into the hous and mayb somebodi look at him would have seen on hi face an express a good deal like the proffer with humil yet with pride too of complet he had use to see on henri s face and mayb he tell himself i not onli do nt know what it is i want but appar i am a good deal younger than i thought also and saw face to face the man who might be hi father and noth shock no hot commun flesh that speech would have been too slow even to,faulkner
6075,6076,and he spent ten day there not onli the esoter the sybarit the steel blade in the silken tessel sheath which henri had begun to ape at the univers but the object of art the mold and mirror of form mad fashion which mr sutpen so your father said accept him as and insist did nt your father say,that he be and would have purchas him as and paid for him with judith even if there had been no other bidder among the four of them or did nt your father say,faulkner
6077,6078,and which he did remain to her until he disappear take henri with him and she never saw him again and war and troubl and grief and bad food fill her day until mayb she did nt even rememb after a while that she had ever forgot him,and the girl the sister the who to know what she saw that afternoon when they rode up the drive what prayer what maiden medit dream ridden up out of whatev fabul land not in harsh stove iron but the silken and tragic lancelot near thirti ten year older than she wa and weari sate with what experi and pleasur which henri s letter must have creat for her,faulkner
6079,6080,and the day came to depart and no sign yet he and henri rode away and still no sign no more sign at part than when he had seen it first in that face where he might he would believ have seen for himself the truth and so would have need no sign if it had nt been for the beard no sign in the eye which could see hi face becaus there wa no beard to hide it could have seen the truth if it were there yet no flicker in them and so he knew it wa in hi face becaus he knew that the other had seen it there just exactli as henri wa to know the next christma eve in the librari that hi father wa not lie by the fact that the father said noth did noth,mayb he even thought wonder if perhap that wa not whi the beard if mayb the other had not hidden behind that beard against thi veri day and if so whi,faulkner
6081,6082,whi,think but whi,faulkner
6083,6084,whi,sinc he want so littl could have understood if the other had want the signal to be in secret would have been quick and glad to let it be in secret even if he could not have understood whi think in the middl of thi my god i am young young and i did nt even know it they did nt even tell me that i wa young feel that same despair and shame like when you have to watch your father fail in physic courag think it should have been me that fail me i not he who stem from that blood which we both bear befor it could have becom corrupt and taint by whatev it wa in mother s that he could not brook,faulkner
6085,6086,shreve cri though quentin had not spoken it had been mere some qualiti some gather of quentin s still lax and hunch figur which presag speech becaus shreve said wait,wait,faulkner
6087,6088,befor quentin could have begun to speak,becaus he had nt even look at her,faulkner
6089,6090,and mayb he had even thought about her by that time mayb at the time when he would be tell himself it cant be so he could not look at me like thi everi day and make no sign if it were so he would even tell himself she would be easi like when you have left the champagn on the supper tabl and are walk toward the whiskey on the sideboard and you happen to pass a cup of lemon sherbet on a tray and you look at the sherbet and tell yourself that would be easi too onli who want it,doe that suit you,faulkner
6091,6092,but it s not love quentin said,becaus whi not,faulkner
6093,6094,becaus listen,what wa it the old dame the aunt rosa told you about how there are some thing that just have to be whether they are or not have to be a damn sight more than some other thing that mayb are and it do nt matter a damn whether they are or not,faulkner
6095,6096,that wa it,he just did nt have time yet,faulkner
6097,6098,jesu he must have known it would be,like that lawyer thought he wa nt a fool the troubl wa he wa nt the kind of notfool the lawyer thought he would be,faulkner
6099,6100,he must have known it wa go to happen,it would be like you pass that sherbet and mayb you knew you would even reach the sideboard and the whiskey yet you knew that tomorrow morn you would want that sherbet then you reach the whiskey and you knew you want that sherbet now mayb you did nt even go to the sideboard mayb you even look back at that champagn on the supper tabl among the dirti haviland and the crumpl damask and all of a sudden you knew you did nt want to go back there even,faulkner
6101,6102,it would be no question of choos have to choos between the champagn or whiskey and the sherbet but all of a sudden it would be spring then in that countri where he had never spent a spring befor and you said north mississippi is a littl harder countri than louisiana with dogwood and violet and the earli scentless flower but the earth and the night still a littl cold and the hard tight sticki bud like young girl nippl on alder and juda tree and beech and mapl and even someth in the cedar like he never saw befor you find that you do nt want anyth but that sherbet and that you have nt been want anyth els but that and you have been want that pretti hard for some know that that sherbet is there for you to take,not just for anybodi to take but for you to take know just from look at that cup that it would be like a flower that if ani other hand reach for it it would have thorn on it but not for your hand and him not use to that sinc all the other cup that had been will and easi for him to take up had nt contain sherbet but champagn or at least kitchen wine,faulkner
6103,6104,and more than that,there wa the know what he suspect might be so or not know if it wa so or not,faulkner
6105,6106,and who to say if it wa nt mayb the possibl of incest becaus who without a sister i do nt know about the other ha been in love and not discov the vain evanesc of the fleshli encount who ha not had to realiz that when the brief all is done you must retreat from both love and pleasur gather up your own rubbish and hat and pant and shoe which you drag through the retreat sinc the god condon and practis these and the dreami immeasur coupl which float oblivi abov the tramel and harri instant the wasnot is wa is a perquisit onli of ballooni and weightless eleph and whale but mayb if there were sin too mayb you would not be permit to escap uncoupl return,that right,faulkner
6107,6108,he ceas he could have been interrupt easili now,quentin could have spoke now but quentin did not,faulkner
6109,6110,he just sat as befor hi hand in hi trouser pocket hi shoulder hug inward and hunch hi face lower and he look somehow curious smaller than he actual wa becaus of hi actual height and qualiti of delicaci about the bone articul which even at twenti still had someth about it some last echo about it of is as compar with the cherub burli of the other who face him who look younger whose veri superior in bulk and displac made him look even younger as a plump boy of twelv who outweigh the other by twenti or thirti pound still look younger than the boy of fourteen who had that plump onc and lost it sold it whether with hi consent or not for that state of virgin which is neither boy s nor girl s,i do nt know quentin said,faulkner
6111,6112,all right shreve said,mayb i do nt either,faulkner
6113,6114,onli jesu some day you are bound to fall in love,they just would nt beat you that way,faulkner
6115,6116,it would be like if god had got jesu born and saw that he had the carpent tool and then never gave him anyth to build with them,dont you believ that,faulkner
6117,6118,i do nt know quentin said,he did not move,faulkner
6119,6120,shreve look at him,even while they were not talk their breath in the tomblik air vapor gentli and quietli,faulkner
6121,6122,the chime for midnight would have rung some time ago now,you mean it do nt matter to you,faulkner
6123,6124,quentin did not answer,that s right,faulkner
6125,6126,dont say it,becaus i would know you are lie,faulkner
6127,6128,right then,listen,faulkner
6129,6130,becaus he never had to worri about the love becaus that would take care of itself,mayb he knew there wa a fate a doom on him like what the old aunt rosa told you about some thing that just have to be whether they are or not just to balanc the book write paid on the old sheet so that whoever keep them can take it out of the ledger and burn it get rid of it,faulkner
6131,6132,he knew all the time that the love would take care of itself,mayb that wa whi he did nt have to think about her dure those three month between that septemb and that christma while henri talk about her to him say everi time he breath her and my live are to exist within and upon your did not need to wast ani time over the love after it happen backfir on him whi he never bother to write her ani letter except that last one which she would want to save whi he never actual propos to her and gave her a ring for mr sutpen to show around,faulkner
6133,6134,becaus the fate wa on her too the same old abraham,i want to go to bed with who might be my sister,faulkner
6135,6136,all right and then forgot that too,becaus he did nt have time,faulkner
6137,6138,that is he did nt have anyth els but time becaus he had to wait,but not for her,faulkner
6139,6140,that wa all fix,it wa the other,faulkner
6141,6142,mayb he thought it would be in the mail bag each time the nigger rode over from sutpen s hundr and henri believ it wa the letter from her that he wa wait for when what he wa think wa mayb he will write it then,he would just have to write i am your father,faulkner
6143,6144,burn thi and i would do it,or if not that a sheet a scrap of paper with the one word charl in hi hand and i would know what he meant and he would not even have to ask me to burn it,faulkner
6145,6146,or a lock of hi hair or a pare from hi fingernail and i would know them becaus i believ now that i have known what hi hair and hi fingernail would look like all my life could choos that lock and that pare out of a thousand,and it did not come and hi letter went to her everi two week and her came back to him and mayb he thought if one of mine to her should come back to me unopen then,faulkner
6147,6148,that would be a sign,and that did nt happen and then henri began to talk about hi stop at sutpen s hundr for a day or so on hi way home and he said all right to it said it will be henri who will get the letter the letter say it is inconveni for me to come at that time so appar he doe not intend to acknowledg me as hi son but at least i shall have forc him to admit that i am,faulkner
6149,6150,and that one did not come either and the date wa set and the famili at sutpen s hundr notifi of it and that letter did not come either and he thought it will be then i wrong him mayb thi is what he ha been wait for and mayb hi heart sprang then mayb he said ye,ye,faulkner
6151,6152,i will renounc her i will renounc love and all that will be cheap cheap even though he say to me never look upon my face again take my love and my acknowledg in secret and go i will do that i will not even demand to know of him what it wa my mother did that justifi hi action toward her and me,so the day came and he and henri rode the forti mile again into the gate and up the drive to the hous,faulkner
6153,6154,what wa it you said,all right shreve said,faulkner
6155,6156,just listen,rode the forti mile and into the gate and up to the hous,faulkner
6157,6158,and thi time sutpen wa nt even there,and ellen did nt even know where he had gone believ blandli and volubl that he had gone to memphi or mayb even to saint loui on busi and henri and judith not even care that much and onli he bon to know where sutpen had gone say to himself of cours he wa nt sure he had to go there to make sure tell himself that loud now loud and fast too so he would not could not hear the think the but if he suspect whi not have told me,faulkner
6159,6160,and judith neither have to acced to the throw nor to resist it but just be just exist and breath like henri did who mayb one morn dure that spring wake up and lay right still in the bed and took stock ad the figur and drew the balanc and told himself all right,i am tri to make myself into what i think he want me to be he can do anyth he want to with me he ha onli to tell me what to do and i will do it even though what he ask me to do look to me like dishonor i would still do it onli judith be a femal and so wiser than that would not even consid dishonor she would just say all right,faulkner
6161,6162,i will do anyth he might ask me to do and that is whi he will never ask me to do anyth that i consid dishonor so that mayb he even kiss her that time the first time she had ever been kiss mayb and she too innoc to be coy or modest or even to know that she had been tempor with mayb afterward just look at him with a kind of peac and blank surpris at the fact that your sweetheart appar kiss you the first time like your brother of cours that your brother ever thought of could be brought to kiss you on the mouth that when the two day were up and he wa gone again and ellen shriek at her what,no engag no troth no ring,faulkner
6163,6164,she would be too astonish even to lie about it becaus that would be the first time it would have occur to her that there had been no propos,of hi heart then while he rode to the river and then on the steamboat itself where he walk up and down the deck feel through the deck the engin drive him nearer and nearer day and night to the moment which he must have realiz now he had been wait for ever sinc he had got big enough to comprehend,faulkner
6165,6166,of cours everi now and then he would have to say it pretti fast and loud that s all it is,he just want to make sure first to drown out the old but whi do it thi way,faulkner
6167,6168,whi not back there,nearer and nearer until suspens and puzzlement and hast and all seem blend into one sublim of passiv surrend in which he thought onli all right,faulkner
6169,6170,all right,even thi may even if he want to do it thi may,faulkner
6171,6172,i will promis never to see her again,never to see him again,faulkner
6173,6174,then he reach home,and he never learn if sutpen had been there or not,faulkner
6175,6176,he never knew,he believ it but he never mother the same somber unchang fierc paranoiac whom he had left in septemb from whom he could learn noth by indirect and whom he dare not ask veri fact that he saw through the skill question of the lawyer as to how he had like the school and the peopl of that countri and how had he not perhap,faulkner
6177,6178,he had made friend up there among the countri famili onli that much more proof to him at that time that sutpen had not been there or at least the lawyer wa not awar that he had sinc now that he believ he had fathom the lawyer s design in send him to that particular school to begin with he saw noth in the question to indic that the lawyer had learn anyth new sinc,or what he could have learn in that interview with the lawyer becaus it would be a short one it would be next to the shortest one ever to transpir between them the shortest one of all next to the last one of cours the one which would occur in the next summer when henri would be with him,faulkner
6179,6180,becaus the lawyer would not dare risk ask him outright just as he bon did not dare to ask hi mother outright,becaus though the lawyer believ him to be rather a fool than dull or dens yet even he the lawyer never for one moment believ that even bon wa go to be the kind of a fool he wa go to be,faulkner
6181,6182,so he told the lawyer noth and the lawyer told him noth and the summer pass and septemb came and still the lawyer hi mother too had not onc ask him if he want to return to the school,so that at last he had to say it himself that he intend to return and mayb he knew that he had lost that move sinc there wa noth whatev in the lawyer s face save an agent s acquiesc,faulkner
6183,6184,so he return to school where henri wa wait oh ye wait for him who did not even say you did nt answer my letter,you did nt even write to judith who had alreadi said what my sister and i have and are belong to you but mayb he did write to judith now by the first nigger post which rode to sutpen s hundr about how it had been an unev summer and henc noth to write about with mayb charl bon plain and inelid on the outsid of the envelop and he think he will have to see that,faulkner
6185,6186,mayb he will send it back think mayb if it come back noth will stop me then and so mayb at last i will know what i am go to do,but it did nt come back,faulkner
6187,6188,and the other did nt come back,and the fall pass and christma came and they rode again to sutpen s hundr and thi time sutpen wa not there again he wa in the field he had gone to town he wa sutpen not there when they rode up and bon knew he had not expect him to be there say now,faulkner
6189,6190,now,now,faulkner
6191,6192,it will come now,it will come thi time and i am young young becaus i still do nt know what i am go to do,faulkner
6193,6194,so mayb what he wa do that twilight becaus he knew that sutpen had return wa now in the hous it would be like a wind someth dark and chill breath upon him and he stop grave quiet alert think what,what is it,faulkner
6195,6196,then he would know he could feel the other enter the hous and he would let hi held breath go quiet and easi a profound exhal hi heart quiet too in the garden while he walk with judith and talk to her gallant and eleg and automat and judith think about that like she thought about that first kiss back in the summer so that s it,that s what love is bludgeon onc more by disappoint but still unbow what he wa do there now wa wait tell himself mayb even yet he will send for me,faulkner
6197,6198,at least say it to me even though he knew better he is in the librari now he ha sent the nigger for henri now henri is enter the room so that mayb he stop and face her with someth in hi face that wa smile now and took her by the elbow and turn her easi and gentl until she face the hous and said go,i wish to be alon to think about love and she went just as she took the kiss that day with mayb the feel of the flat of hi hand light and momentari upon her behind,faulkner
6199,6200,and he stood there face the hous until henri came out and they look at one anoth for a while with no word said and then turn and walk togeth through the garden across the lot and into the stabl where mayb there wa a nigger there and mayb they saddl the two hors themselv and wait until the hous nigger came with the two repack saddlebag,and mayb he did nt even say then but he sent no word to me,faulkner
6201,6202,shreve ceas,that is for all the two of them shreve and quentin knew he had stop sinc for all the two of them knew he had never begun sinc it did not matter and possibl neither of them consciou of the distinct which one had been do the talk,faulkner
6203,6204,so it wa four of them who rode the two hors through that night and then across the bright frosti north mississippi christma day in someth veri like pariahhood pass the plantat hous with sprig of holli thrust beneath the knocker on the door and mistleto hang from the chandeli and bowl of eggnog and toddi on tabl in the hall and the blue unwind wood smoke stand abov the plaster chimney of the slave quarter to the river and the steamboat,there would be christma on the boat too the same holli and mistleto the same eggnog and toddi perhap doubtless a christma supper and a ball but not for them the two of them in the dark and the cold stand at the guard rail abov the dark water and still not talk sinc there wa noth to say the two of them the four of them held in that probat that suspens by henri who knew but still did not believ who wa go deliber to look upon and prove to himself that which so shreve and quentin believ would be like death for him to learn,faulkner
6205,6206,but so she ha fallen in love with him and then sat laugh harshli and steadili at henri who could not have lie to her even if he would have who did not even have to answer at all either ye or no,four of them there in that room in new orlean in just as in a sens there were four of them here in thi tomblik room in massachusett in,faulkner
6207,6208,and bon may have probabl did take henri to call on the octoroon mistress and the child as mr compson said though neither shreve nor quentin believ that the visit affect henri as mr compson seem to think,in fact quentin did not even tell shreve what hi father had said about the visit,faulkner
6209,6210,so the old dame ask henri that one question and then sat there laugh at him so he knew then they both knew then,and so now it would be short thi time with the lawyer the shortest one of all,faulkner
6211,6212,becaus the lawyer would have been watch him mayb there had even been a letter dure that second fall while the lawyer wa wait and still noth seem to be happen up there and mayb the lawyer wa the reason whi bon never answer henri s and judith s letter dure that summer becaus he never got them letter two or mayb three page of your humbl and obedi e and t and c that boil down to eighteen word i know you are a fool but just what kind of a fool are you go to be,and bon wa at least enough of a notfool to do the boil down,faulkner
6213,6214,watch him not concern yet just consider annoy give bon plenti of time to come to him give him all of a week mayb after have contriv to get hold of henri and find out a good deal of what henri wa think without henri ever know it befor he would contriv bon too and mayb so good at the contriv that even bon would not know at onc what wa come,it would be a short one,faulkner
6215,6216,it would be no secret between them now it would just be unsaid the lawyer behind the desk and mayb in the secret drawer the ledger where he had just finish ad in the last past year s interest compound between the intrins and the love and pride at two hundr percent lawyer fret annoy but not at all concern sinc he not onli knew he had the screw but he still did not realli believ that bon wa that kind of a fool though he wa about to alter hi opinion somewhat about the dull or at least the backward the lawyer watch him and say smooth and oili sinc it would be no secret now who would know now that bon knew all he would ever know or would need to know to make the coup do you know that you are a veri fortun young man,with most of us even when we are lucki enough to get our reveng we must pay for it sometim in actual dollar,faulkner
6217,6218,while you are not onli in a posit to get your reveng clear your mother s name but the balm with which you will assuag her injuri will have a collater valu which can be translat into the thing which a young man need which are hi due and which whether we like it or not may he had onli in exchang for hard and bon not say what do you mean,and not move yet that is the lawyer would not be awar that he wa begin to move continu the lawyer smooth and easi and more than thi than the reveng as lagniapp to the reveng as it were thi nosegay of an afternoon thi scentless prairi flower which will not be miss and which might as well bloom in your lapel as in anoth s do you young men put it,faulkner
6219,6220,nice littl and then he would see bon mayb the eye mayb he would just hear the feet move,and then pistol derring hors pistol revolv whatev it wa and all he would be crouch back against the wall behind the overturn chair snarl stand back,faulkner
6221,6222,stop,then scream help,faulkner
6223,6224,help,then just scream becaus he would hear and feel hi own wrench bone befor he could free hi finger of the pistol and hi neck bone too as bon would strike him with the palm on one cheek and then with the back of the hand on the other mayb he could even hear bon too say stop it,faulkner
6225,6226,hush,i m not go to hurt you or mayb it wa the lawyer in him that said the hush which he obey who got him back into the right chair again half lie upon the desk the lawyer in him that warn him not to say you will pay for thi but instead to half lie there nurs hi wrench hand in hi handkerchief while bon stood look down at him hold the pistol by the barrel against hi leg say if you feel that you requir satisfact of cours you and the lawyer sit back now dab the handkerchief at hi cheek now i wa wrong,faulkner
6227,6228,i misunderstood your feel about the matter,i ask your pardon and bon grant,faulkner
6229,6230,as you wish,i will accept either an apolog or a bullet as you prefer and the lawyer there would be a faint fade red in hi cheek but that would be all noth in the voic or in the eye i see you are go to collect full measur for my unfortun ridicul,faulkner
6231,6232,even if i felt that right wa on my side which i do not i would still have to declin your offer,i would not be your equal with pistol and bon nor with knive or rapier too,faulkner
6233,6234,and the lawyer smooth and easi nor knive or rapier too,so that now the lawyer would nt even need to say you will pay for thi becaus bon would be say that for him who would stand there with the lax pistol think but onli with knive or pistol or rapier,faulkner
6235,6236,so i cant beat him,i could shoot him,faulkner
6237,6238,i would shoot him with no more compunct than i would a snake or a man who cuckold me,but he would still beat me,faulkner
6239,6240,think ye,he did beat me while listen shreve said cri,faulkner
6241,6242,it would be while he would be lie in a bedroom of that privat hous in corinth after pittsburg land while hi shoulder got well two year later and the letter from the octoroon mayb even the one that contain the photograph of her and the child final overtak him wail for money and tell him that the lawyer had depart for texa or mexico or somewher at last and that she the octoroon could not find hi mother either and so without doubt the lawyer had murder her befor he stole the money sinc it would be just like both of them to flee or get themselv kill without provid for her at all,they knew now,faulkner
6243,6244,and jesu think of him bon who had want to know who had had the most reason to want to know who as far as he knew had never had ani father but had been creat somehow between that woman who would nt let him play with other children and that lawyer who even told the woman whether or not each time she bought a piec of meat or a loaf of peopl neither of whom had taken pleasur or found passion in get him or suffer pain and travail in horn perhap if one of the two had onli told him the truth none of what happen would ever have come to pass while there wa henri who had father and secur and content and all yet wa told the truth by both of them while he bon wa told by neither,and think of henri who had said at first it wa a lie and then when he knew it wa not a lie had still said i do nt believ it who had found even in that i do nt believ it enough of strength to repudi home and blood in order to champion hi defianc and in which champion he prove hi content to be the fals one and wa more than ever interdict against return home jesu think of the load he had to carri born of two methodist or of one long invinc line of methodist and rais in provinci north mississippi face with incest incest of all thing that might have been reserv for him that all hi hered and train had to rebel against on principl and in a situat where he knew that neither incest nor train wa go to help him solv it,faulkner
6245,6246,so that mayb when they left and walk the street that night and at last bon said well,now what,faulkner
6247,6248,henri said wait,wait,faulkner
6249,6250,let me get use to it,and mayb it wa two day or three day and henri said you shall not,faulkner
6251,6252,shall not and then it wa bon that said wait,i am your older brother do you say shall not to me,faulkner
6253,6254,and mayb it wa a week mayb bon took henri to see the octoroon and henri look at her and said aint that enough for you,and bon said do you want it to be enough,faulkner
6255,6256,and henri said wait,wait,faulkner
6257,6258,i must have time to get use to it,you will have to give me time,faulkner
6259,6260,jesu think how henri must have talk dure that winter and then that spring with lincoln elect and the alabama convent and the south began to draw out of the union and then there were two presid in the unit state and the telegraph brought the news about charleston and lincoln call out hi armi and it wa done irrevoc now and henri and bon alreadi decid to go without have to consult one anoth who would have gone anyway even if they had never seen one anoth but certainli now becaus after all you do nt wast a how they must have talk how henri would say but must you marri her,do you have to do it,faulkner
6261,6262,and bon would say he should have told me,he should have told me myself himself,faulkner
6263,6264,i wa fair and honor with him,i wait,faulkner
6265,6266,you know now whi i wait,i gave him everi chanc to tell me himself,faulkner
6267,6268,but he did nt do it,if he had i would have agre and promis never to see her or you or him again,faulkner
6269,6270,but he did nt tell me,i thought at first it wa becaus he did nt know,faulkner
6271,6272,then i knew that he did know and still i wait,but he did nt tell me,faulkner
6273,6274,he just told you sent me a messag like you send a command by a nigger servant to a beggar or a tramp to clear out,dont you see that,faulkner
6275,6276,and henri would say but judith,our sister,faulkner
6277,6278,think of her and bon all right,think of her,faulkner
6279,6280,then what,becaus they both knew what judith would do when she found it out becaus they both knew that women will show pride and honor about almost anyth except love and henri said ye,faulkner
6281,6282,i see,i understand,faulkner
6283,6284,but you will have to give me time to get use to it,you are my older brother you can do that littl for me,faulkner
6285,6286,think of the two of them bon who did nt know what he wa go to do and had to say pretend he did and henri who knew what he wa go to do and had to say he did nt,then it wa christma again then and they had nt heard from judith becaus judith did nt know for sure where they were becaus henri would nt let bon write to her yet then they heard about the compani the univers gray organ up at oxford and mayb they had been wait for that,faulkner
6287,6288,so they took the steamboat north again and more gaieti and excit on the boat now than christma even like it alway is when a war start befor the scene get clutter up with bad food and wound soldier and widow and orphan and them take no part in it now either but stand at the rail again abov the churn water and mayb it would be two or three day then henri said suddenli cri suddenli but king have done it,even duke,faulkner
6289,6290,there wa that lorrain duke name john someth that marri hi sister,the pope excommun him but it did nt hurt,faulkner
6291,6292,it did nt hurt,they were still husband and wife,faulkner
6293,6294,they were still aliv,they still love,faulkner
6295,6296,then again loud fast but you will have to wait,you will have to give me time,faulkner
6297,6298,mayb the war will settl it and we wont need to,and mayb thi wa one place where your old man wa right and they rode into oxford without touch sutpen s hundr and sign the compani roster and then hid somewher to wait and henri let bon write judith one letter they would send it by hand by a nigger that would steal into the quarter by night and give it to judith s maid and judith sent the pictur in the metal case and they rode on ahead to wait until the compani got through make flag and ride about the state tell girl farewel and start for the front,faulkner
6299,6300,jesu think of them,becaus bon would know what henri wa do just as he had alway known what henri wa think sinc that first day when they had look at one anoth,faulkner
6301,6302,mayb he would know all the better what henri wa do becaus he did not know what he himself wa go to do that he would not know until all of a sudden some day it would burst clear and he would know then that he had known all the time what it would be so he did nt have to bother about himself and so all he had to do wa just to watch henri tri to reconcil what he henri knew he wa go to do with all the voic of hi hered and train which said no,no,faulkner
6303,6304,you can not you must not,you shall not,faulkner
6305,6306,mayb they would even be under fire now with the shell rush and rumbl past overhead and burst and them lie there wait to charg and henri would cri again but that lorrain duke did it,there must have been lot in the world who have done it that peopl do nt know about that mayb they suffer for it and die for it and are in hell now for it,faulkner
6307,6308,but they did it and it do nt matter now even the one we do know about are just name now and it do nt matter now and bon watch him and listen to him and think it s becaus i do nt know myself what i am go to do and so he is awar that i am undecid without know that he is awar,perhap if i told him now that i am go to do it he would know hi own mind and tell me you shall not,faulkner
6309,6310,and mayb your old man wa right that time and they did think mayb the war would settl it and they would not have to themselv or at least mayb henri hope it would becaus mayb your old man wa right here too and bon did nt care that sinc both of the two peopl who could have given him a father had declin to do it noth matter to him now reveng or love or all sinc he knew now that reveng could not compens him nor love assuag,mayb it wa nt even henri who would nt let him write to judith but bon himself who did not write her becaus he did nt care about anyth not even that he did nt know yet what he wa go to do,faulkner
6311,6312,then it wa the next year and bon wa an offic now and they were move toward shilo without know that either talk again as they move along in column the offic drop back alongsid the file in which the privat march and henri cri again hold hi desper and urgent voic down to underton dont you know yet what you are go to do,while bon would look at him for a moment with that express which could have been smile suppos i told you i did not intend to go back to her,faulkner
6313,6314,and henri would walk there besid him with hi pack and hi eight feet of musket and he would begin to pant pant and pant while bon watch him i am out in front of you a lot now go into battl charg i will be out in front of and henri pant stop,stop,faulkner
6315,6316,and bon watch him with that faint thin express about the mouth and eye who would ever know,you would not even have to know for certain yourself becaus who could say but what a yanke ball might have struck me at the exact second you pull your trigger or even and henri pant and look glare at the sky with hi teeth show and the sweat on hi face and the knuckl of the hand on hi musket butt white say pant stop,faulkner
6317,6318,stop,stop,faulkner
6319,6320,stop,then it wa shilo the second day and the lost battl and the brigad fall back from pittsburgh land and listen shreve cri wait now wait,faulkner
6321,6322,glare at quentin pant himself as if he had had to suppli hi shade not onli with a cue but with breath to obey it in becaus your old man wa wrong here too,he said it wa bon who wa wound but it wa nt,faulkner
6323,6324,becaus who told him,who told sutpen or your grandfath either which of them it wa who wa hit,faulkner
6325,6326,sutpen did nt know becaus he wa nt there and your grandfath wa nt there either becaus that wa where he wa hit too where he lost hi arm,so who told them,faulkner
6327,6328,not henri becaus hi father never saw henri but that one time and mayb they never had time to talk about wound and besid to talk about wound in the confeder armi in would be like coal miner talk about soot and not bon becaus sutpen never saw him at all becaus he wa wa not bon it wa henri bon that found henri at last and stoop to pick him up and henri fought back struggl say let be,let me die,faulkner
6329,6330,i wont have to know it then and bon said so you do want me to go back to her and henri lay there struggl and pant with the sweat on hi face and hi teeth bloodi insid hi chew lip and bon said say you do want me to go back to her,mayb then i wont do it,faulkner
6331,6332,the room wa inde tomblik a qualiti stale and static and moribund beyond ani mere vivid and live cold,yet they remain in it though not thirti feet away wa bed and warmth,faulkner
6333,6334,quentin had not even put on hi overcoat which lay on the floor where it had fallen from the arm of the chair where shreve had put it down,they did not retreat from the cold,faulkner
6335,6336,so that it must have seem to him now that he knew at last whi he had not been abl to decid what he want to do,mayb he thought for just a second my god i am still young even after these four year i am still young but just for a second becaus mayb in the same breath he said all right,faulkner
6337,6338,then i am young,but i still believ even though what i believ probabl is that war suffer these four year of keep hi men aliv and abl in order to swap them blood and flesh for the largest amount of ground at it bargain price will have chang him which i know that it doe not do to where he will say to me not forgiv me but you are my oldest son,faulkner
6339,6340,protect your sister never see either of us again then it wa and what wa left of the armi of the west with noth remain now but the abil to walk backward slow and stubborn and to endur musketri and shell mayb they did nt even miss the shoe and overcoat and food ani more now and that wa whi he could write about the captur stove polish like he did in the letter to judith when he final knew what he wa go to do at last and told henri and henri said thank god,thank god not for the incest of cours but becaus at last they were go to do someth at last he could be someth even though that someth wa the irrevoc repudi of the old hered and train and the accept of etern damnat,faulkner
6341,6342,mayb he could even quit talk about hi lorrain duke then becaus he could say now it is nt your nor hi nor the pope s hell that we are all go to it s my mother s and her mother s and father s and their mother s and father s hell and it is nt you who are go there but we the four of us,and so at least we will all be togeth where we belong sinc even if onli he went there we would still have to be there too sinc the three of us are just illus that he begot and your illus are a part of you like your bone and flesh and memori and we will all be togeth in torment and so we will not need to rememb love and fornic and mayb in torment you can not even rememb whi you are there,faulkner
6343,6344,and if we can not rememb all thi it cant be much torment,then they were in carolina that januari and februari of and what wa left of them had been walk backward for almost a year now and the distanc between them and richmond wa less far than the distanc they had come the distanc between them and the end a good deal less far,faulkner
6345,6346,but to bon it wa not the space between them and defeat but the space between him and the other regiment between him and the hour the moment he will not even have to ask me i will just touch flesh with him and i will say it myself you will not need to worri she shall never see me again,then march in carolina and still the walk backward slow and stubborn and listen to the northward now becaus there wa noth to hear from ani other direct becaus in all the other direct it wa finish now and all they expect to hear from the north wa defeat,faulkner
6347,6348,then one day he wa an offic he would have known heard that lee had detach some troop and sent them down to reinforc them perhap he even knew the name and number of the regiment befor they arriv he saw sutpen,mayb that first time sutpen actual did not see him mayb that first time he could tell himself that wa whi he did nt see me so that he had to put himself in sutpen s way make hi chanc and situat,faulkner
6349,6350,then for the second time he look at the expressionless and rocklik face at the pale bore eye in which there wa no flicker noth the face in which he saw hi own featur in which he saw recognit and that wa all,that wa all there wa noth further now perhap he just breath onc quietli with on hi own face that express which might at a glanc have been call smile while he thought i could forc him,faulkner
6351,6352,i could go to him and forc him know that he would not becaus it wa all finish now that wa all of it now and at last,and mayb it wa that same night or mayb a night a week later while they were stop becaus even sherman would have to stop sometim at night with the fire burn for warmth at least becaus at least warmth is cheap and doe nt remain consum that bon said henri and said it wont be much longer now and then there wont be anyth left we wont even have anyth to do left not even the privileg of walk backward slowli for a reason for the sake of honor and what s left of pride,faulkner
6353,6354,not god evid we have done without him for four year onli he just did nt think to notifi us and not onli not shoe and cloth but not even ani need for them and not onli no land nor ani way to make food but no need for the food sinc we have learn to live without that too and so if you do nt have god and you do nt need food and cloth and shelter there is nt anyth for honor and pride to climb on and hold to and flourish,and if you have nt got honor and pride then noth matter,faulkner
6355,6356,onli there is someth in you that doe nt care about honor and pride yet that live that even walk backward for a whole year just to live that probabl even when thi is over and there is not even defeat left will still declin to sit still in the sun and die but will be out in the wood move and seek where just will and endur could not move it grub for root and old mindless sentient undream meat that doe nt even know ani differ between despair and victori henri,and then henri would begin to say thank god,faulkner

6367,6368,do i have your permiss henri,and henri write,faulkner
6369,6370,write,write,faulkner
6371,6372,so bon wrote the letter after the four year and henri read it and sent it off,but they did nt quit then and follow the letter,faulkner
6373,6374,they still walk backward slow and stubborn listen toward the north for the end of it becaus it take an aw lot of charact to quit anyth when you are lose and they had been walk backward slow for a year now so all they had left wa not the will but just the abil the groov habit to endur,then one night they had stop again sinc sherman had stop again and an orderli came along the bivouac line and found henri at last and said sutpen the colonel want you in hi tent,faulkner
6375,6376,and so you and the old dame the aunt rosa went out there that night and the old nigger clyti tri to stop you stop her she held your arm and said dont let her go up there young marster but you could nt stop her either becaus she wa strong with fortyf year of hate like fortyf year of raw meat and all clyti had wa just fortyf or fifti year of despair and wait and you you did nt even want to be there at all to begin with,and you could nt stop her either and then you saw that clyti s troubl wa nt anger nor even distrust it wa terror fear,faulkner
6377,6378,it wa just as well sinc he had no listen,perhap he wa awar of it,faulkner
6379,6380,then suddenli he had no talker either though possibl he wa not awar of thi,becaus now neither of them were there,faulkner
6381,6382,you feller go,are we,faulkner
6383,6384,whi not wait for us,air,faulkner
6385,6386,the men about the fire would not hear thi exchang though they would present hear the orderli plainli enough as he pass from fire to fire ask for sutpen and be direct on and so reach the fire at last the smolder log with hi monoton speech sutpen,i m look for sutpen until henri sit up and say here,faulkner
6387,6388,he is gaunt and rag and unshaven becaus of the last four year and becaus he had not quit got hi height when the four year began he is not as tall by two inch as he gave promis of be and not as heavi by thirti pound as he probabl will be a few year after he ha outliv the four year if he do outliv them,he is it,faulkner
6389,6390,colonel want you,the orderli doe not return with him,faulkner
6391,6392,instead he walk alon through the dark along a rut road a road rut and cut and churn where the gun have pass over it that afternoon and reach the tent at last one of the few tent the canva wall gleam faintli from a candl within the silhouett of a sentri befor it who challeng him,henri colonel sent for me,faulkner

6395,6396,he henri come to salut face a graff sleev with colonel s braid on it one beard cheek a jut nose a shaggi droop of ironriddl face which henri doe not recogn not becaus he ha not seen it in four year and doe not expect to see it here and now but rather becaus he is not look at it,he just salut the braid cuff and stand so until the other say,faulkner
6397,6398,even now henri doe not start,he just stand so the two of them stand so look at one anoth,faulkner
6399,6400,it is the older man who move first though they meet in the center of the tent where they embrac and kiss befor henri is awar that he ha move wa go to move move by what of close blood which in the reflex instant abrog and reconcil even though it doe not yet perhap never will forgiv who stand now while hi father hold hi face between both hand look at it,sutpen son,faulkner

6935,6936,not the skin the flesh itself as though the skull had been mold in a still and deadli regular and then bake in a fierc oven,how much do they pay for overtim he said,faulkner
6937,6938,and then byron knew,he knew then whi the other work in the sunday cloth and whi he had had no lunch with him either yesterday or today and whi he had not quit with the other at noon,faulkner
6939,6940,he knew as well as if the man had told him that he did not have a nickel in hi pocket and that in all likelihood he had live on cigarett for two or three day now,almost with the thought byron wa offer hi own pail the action as reflex as the thought,faulkner
6941,6942,becaus befor the act wa complet the man without chang hi indol and contemptu attitud turn hi face and look onc at the proffer pail through the droop smoke of the cigarett,i ain t hungri,faulkner
6943,6944,the man came to work in new overal and with a paper bag of food,but he did not squat with them in the pump hous to eat at noon and the look wa still on hi face,faulkner
6945,6946,let it stay there the foreman said,at least christma didn t seem to think so to act so,faulkner
6947,6948,he still had noth to say to anyon even after six month,no one knew what he did between mill hour,faulkner
6949,6950,now and then one of hi fellow worker would pass him on the squar down town after supper and it would be as though christma had never seen the other befor,he would be wear then the new hat and the iron trouser and the cigarett in one side of hi mouth and the smoke sneer across hi face,faulkner
6951,6952,no one knew where he live slept at night save that now and then someon would see him follow a path that came up through the wood on the edg of town as if he might live out that way somewher,thi is not what byron know now,faulkner
6953,6954,thi is just what he knew then what he heard and watch as it came to hi knowledg,none of them knew then where christma live and what he wa actual do behind the veil the screen of hi negro s job at the mill,faulkner
6955,6956,possibl no one would ever have known if it had not been for the other stranger brown,but as soon as brown told there were a dozen men who admit have bought whiskey from christma for over two year meet him at night and alon in the wood behind an old coloni plantat hous two mile from town in which a middleag spinster name burden live alon,faulkner
6957,6958,but even the one who bought the whiskey did not know that christma wa actual live in a tumbl down negro cabin on miss burden s place and that he had been live in it for more than two year,then one day about six month ago anoth stranger appear at the mill as christma had done seek work,faulkner
6959,6960,he wa young too tall alreadi in overal which look as though he had been in them constantli for some time and he look as though he had been travel light also,he had an alert weakli handsom face with a small white scar besid the mouth that look as if it had been contempl a great deal in the mirror and a way of jerk hi head quickli and glanc over hi shoulder like a mule doe in front of an automobil in the road byron thought,faulkner
6961,6962,but it wa not alon backwatch alarm it seem also to byron to possess a qualiti of assur brass as though the man were reiter and insist all the while that he wa afraid of noth that might or could approach him from behind,and when mooney the foreman saw the new hand byron believ that he and mooney had the same thought,faulkner
6963,6964,mooney said well simm is safe from hire anyth at all when he put that fellow on,he put me in mind of one of these car run along the street with a radio in it,faulkner
6965,6966,he put me in mind of a hors,not a mean hors,faulkner
6967,6968,just a worthless hors,sho mooney said,faulkner
6969,6970,with a lot of motion to it tell everybodi who he wa and where he had been in a tone and manner that wa the essenc of the man himself that carri within itself it own confound and mendac,so that a man put no more belief in what he said that he had done than in what he said hi name wa byron thought,faulkner
6971,6972,there wa no reason whi hi name should not have been brown,it wa that look at him a man would know that at some time in hi life he would reach some crisi in hi own foolish when he would chang hi name and that he would think of brown to chang it to with a kind of gleeful exult as though the name had never been invent,faulkner
6973,6974,the thing wa there wa no reason whi he should have had or have need ani name at all,nobodi care just as byron believ that no one wear pant anyway care where he came from nor where he went nor how long he stay,faulkner
6975,6976,becaus wherev he came from and wherev he had been a man knew that he wa just live on the countri like a locust,it wa as though he had been do it for so long now that all of him had becom scatter and diffus and now there wa noth left but the transpar and weightless shell blown oblivi and without destin upon whatev wind,faulkner
6977,6978,he work some though after a fashion,byron believ that there wa not even enough left of him to do a good shrewd job of shirk,faulkner
6979,6980,to desir to shirk even sinc a man must be better than common to do a good job of maling the same as a good job at anyth els of steal and murder even,he must be aim at some specif and definit goal work toward it,faulkner
6981,6982,and he believ that brown wa not,they heard how he went and lost hi entir first week s pay in a crap game on the first saturday night,faulkner
6983,6984,byron said to mooney i am surpris at that,what make you think that he could be good at ani kind of devil when he ain t ani good at anyth as easi as shovel sawdust,faulkner
6985,6986,that he could fool anybodi with anyth as hard to handl as a pair of dice when he can t with anyth as easi to handl as a scoop then he said well i reckon there ain t ani man so sorri he can t beat somebodi do someth,they both turn and look down at the sawdust pile where brown and christma labor the one with that brood and savag steadi the other with a higharm and errat motion which could not have been fool even itself,faulkner
6987,6988,i reckon so mooney said,but unlik christma he made no chang in hi costum for some time,faulkner
6989,6990,he ll win just enough in that crap game some saturday night to buy a new suit and still have fifti cent in nickel to rattl in hi pocket mooney said,and on the next monday morn we ain t go to see him again meanwhil brown continu to come to work in the same overal and shirt in which he had arriv in jefferson lose hi week s pay in the saturday night dice game or perhap win a littl greet either the one or the other with the same shout of imbecil laughter joke and chaf with the veri men who in all likelihood were period rob him,faulkner
6991,6992,then one day they heard that he had won sixti dollar,well that s the last we ll see of him one said,faulkner
6993,6994,i don t know mooney said,sixti dollar is the wrong figur,faulkner
6995,6996,if it had been either ten dollar or five hundr i reckon you d be right,but not just sixti,faulkner
6997,6998,he ll just feel now that he is settl down good here draw at last somewher about what he is worth a week and on monday he did return to work in the overal they saw them brown and christma down at the sawdust pile,they had been watch the two of them down there from the day when brown went to work christma jab hi shovel into the sawdust slowli and steadili and hard as though he were chop up a buri snake or a man mooney said and brown lean on hi shovel while he appar told christma a stori an anecdot,faulkner
6999,7000,becaus present he would laugh shout with laughter hi head backflung while besid him the other man work with silent and unflag savag,then brown would fall to again work for a time onc again as fast as christma but pick up less and less in the scoop until at last the shovel would not even touch the sawdust in it flag arc,faulkner
7001,7002,then he would lean upon it again and appar finish whatev it wa that he wa tell christma tell to the man who did not even seem to hear hi voic,as if the other were a mile away or spoke a differ languag from the one he knew byron thought,faulkner
7003,7004,and they would be seen togeth down town on saturday even sometim christma in hi neat soberli auster sergeandwhit and the straw hat and brown in hi new suit it wa tan with a red crisscross and he had a color shirt and a hat like christma but with a color band talk and laugh hi voic heard clear across the squar and back again in echo somewhat as a meaningless sound in a church seem to come from everywher at onc,like he aim for everybodi to see how he and christma were buddi byron thought,faulkner
7005,7006,and then christma would turn and with that still sullen face of hi walk out of whatev small gather the sheer empti sound of brown s voic had surround them with with brown follow still laugh and talk,and each time the other workmen would say well he won t be back on the job monday morning but each monday he wa back,faulkner
7007,7008,it wa christma who quit first,he quit one saturday night without warn after almost three year,faulkner
7009,7010,it wa brown who inform them that christma had quit,some of the other worker were famili men and some were bachelor and they were of differ age and they led a cathol varieti of live yet on monday morn they all came to work with a kind of graviti almost decorum,faulkner
7011,7012,some of them were young and they drank and gambl on saturday night and even went to memphi now and then,yet on monday morn they came quietli and soberli to work in clean overal and clean shirt wait quietli until the whistl blew and then go quietli to work as though there were still someth of sabbath in the overling air which establish a tenet that no matter what a man had done with hi sabbath to come quiet and clean to work on monday morn wa no more than seemli and right to do,faulkner
7013,7014,that is what they had alway remark about brown,on monday morn as like as not he would appear in the same soil cloth of last week and with a black stubbl that had known no razor,faulkner
7015,7016,and he would be more noisi than ever shout and play the prank of a child of ten,to the sober other it did not look right,faulkner
7017,7018,to them it wa as though he had arriv nake or drunk,henc it wa brown who on thi monday morn notifi them that christma had quit,faulkner
7019,7020,he arriv late but that wa not it,he hadn t shave either but that wa not it,faulkner
7021,7022,he wa quiet,for a time they did not know that he wa even present who by that time should have had half the men there curs him and some in good earnest,faulkner
7023,7024,he appear just as the whistl blew and went straight to the sawdust pile and went to work without a word to anyon even when one man spoke to him,and then they saw that he wa down there alon that christma hi partner wa not there,faulkner
7025,7026,he spat briefli,ye,faulkner
7027,7028,he got rich too fast,one of them did mooney said still watch brown,faulkner
7029,7030,i saw them yesterday ride in a new car,he jerk hi head toward wa drive it,faulkner
7031,7032,i wasn t surpris at that,he wouldn t have ani troubl do that at ani time mooney said,faulkner

7035,7036,they never got that rich out here one said,byron look at him,faulkner
7037,7038,i reckon byron stay out of mean too much himself to keep up with other folk the other said,they look at byron,faulkner
7039,7040,brown is what you might call a public servant,christma use to make them come way out to them wood back of miss burden s place at night now brown bring it right into town for them,faulkner
7041,7042,is that a fact,i don t know about christma,faulkner
7043,7044,i wouldn t swear to it,but brown ain t go to be far away from where christma is at,faulkner
7045,7046,whether christma is in it or not i reckon we ain t go to know,and mooney wa right,faulkner
7047,7048,they watch brown until noon down there at the sawdust pile by himself,then the whistl blew and they got their lunch pail and squat in the pump shed and began to eat,faulkner
7049,7050,brown came in glum hi face at onc sullen and injur look like a child s and squat among them hi hand dangl between hi knee,he had no lunch with him today,faulkner

7055,7056,then the whistl blew,they went back to work,faulkner
7057,7058,they watch brown down at the sawdust pile,he would dig for a while then he would begin to slow move slower and slower until at last he would be clutch the shovel as though it were a ride whip and they could see that he wa talk to himself,faulkner
7059,7060,becaus there ain t nobodi els down there for him to tell it to one said,it s not that mooney said,faulkner
7061,7062,he hasn t quit convinc himself yet,the next morn he did not appear,faulkner

7067,7068,he wore now the new suit and the straw hat and he stop at the shed and stood there look at the work men as christma had done on that day three year ago as if somehow the veri attitud of the master s dead life motiv unawar to him the will muscl of the discipl who had learn too quick and too well,but brown mere contriv to look scatter and emptili swagger where the master had look sullen and quiet and fatal as a snake,faulkner
7069,7070,lay into it you slave bastard brown said in a merri loud voic crop with teeth,mooney look at brown,faulkner
7071,7072,then brown s teeth didn t show,like it wa so scatter and so lightli built that it wasn t ani troubl for even him to chang it byron thought,faulkner
7073,7074,i wasn t talk to you brown said,oh i see mooney s tone wa quit pleasant easi,faulkner
7075,7076,well you have told god s truth for onc in your life mooney said,the half of it that is,faulkner
7077,7078,now and then christma would be with him but not often,and it is now no secret what they were do,faulkner
7079,7080,it is a byword among young men and even boy that whiskey can be bought from brown almost on sight and the town is just wait for him to get caught to produc from hi raincoat and offer to sell it to an undercov man,they still do not know for certain if christma is connect with it save that no one believ that brown alon ha sens enough to make a profit even from bootleg and some of them know that christma and brown both live in a cabin on the burden place,faulkner
7081,7082,but even these do not know if miss burden know it or not and if they did they would not tell her,she live in the big hous alon a woman of middleag,faulkner

7085,7086,but it still linger about her and about the place someth dark and outlandish and threat even though she is but a woman and but the descend of them whom the ancestor of the town had reason or thought that they had to hate and dread,but it is there the descend of both in their relationship to one anoth ghost with between them the phantom of the old spill blood and the old horror and anger and fear,faulkner

7233,7234,so hidden it is that the light from the corner street lamp scarc touch it,from the window he can also see the sign which he call hi monument,faulkner
7235,7236,it is plant in the corner of the yard low face the street,it is three feet long and eighteen inch neat oblong present it face to who pass and it back to him,faulkner
7237,7238,but he doe not need to read it becaus he made the sign with hammer and saw neatli and he paint the legend which it bear neatli too tedious when he realis that he would have to begin to have to have money for bread and fire and cloth,when he quit the seminari he had a small incom inherit from hi father which as soon as he got hi church he forward promptli on receipt of the quarterli check to an institut for delinqu girl in memphi,faulkner
7239,7240,then he lost hi church he lost the church and the bitterest thing which he believ that he had ever bitter even than the bereav and the the letter which he wrote them to say that from now on he could send them but half the sum which he had previous sent,so he continu to send them half of a revenu which in it entireti would littl more than have kept him,faulkner
7241,7242,luckili there are thing which i can do he said at the time,gail hightow dd,faulkner
7243,7244,they were still readabl howev though like hightow himself few of the townspeopl need to read them anymor,but now and then a negro nursemaid with her white charg would loiter there and spell them aloud with that vacuou idioci of her idl and illiter kind or a stranger happen along the quiet and remot and unpav and littleus street would paus and read the sign and then look up at the small brown almost conceal hous and pass on now and then the stranger would mention the sign to some acquaint in the town,faulkner
7245,7246,oh ye the friend would say,hightow,faulkner
7247,7248,he live there by himself,he come here as minist of the presbyterian church but hi wife went bad on him,faulkner

7251,7252,some folk claim he knew about it,that he couldn t or wouldn t satisfi her himself and that he knew what she wa do,faulkner
7253,7254,then one saturday night she got kill in a hous or someth in memphi,paper full of it,faulkner
7255,7256,he had to resign from the church but he wouldn t leav jefferson for some reason,they tri to get him to for hi own sake as well as the town s the church s,faulkner
7257,7258,that wa pretti bad on the church you see,have stranger come here and hear about it and him refus to leav the town,faulkner
7259,7260,but he wouldn t go away,he ha live out there on what use to be the main street ever sinc by himself,faulkner
7261,7262,at least it ain t a princip street anymor,that s someth,faulkner
7263,7264,but then he don t worri anybodi anymor and i reckon most folk have forgot about him,doe hi own housework,faulkner
7265,7266,i don t reckon anybodi s even been insid that hous in twentyf year,we don t know whi he stay here,faulkner
7267,7268,but ani day you pass along there about dusk or nightfal you can see him sit in the window,just sit there,faulkner
7269,7270,he doe not rememb it at all until he take hi place in the studi window just befor dusk,then it is just a familiar low oblong shape without ani signific at all low at the street end of the shallow lawn it too might have grown up out of the tragic and inescap earth along with the low spread mapl and the shrub without help or hindranc from him,faulkner
7271,7272,he no longer even look at it as he doe not actual see the tree beneath and through which he watch the street wait for nightfal the moment of night,the hous the studi is dark behind him and he is wait for that instant when all light ha fail out of the sky and it would be night save for that faint light which daygranari leaf and grass blade reluct suspir make still a littl light on earth though night itself ha come,faulkner
7273,7274,now soon he think soon now,art lesson christma card photograph develop he thought dd,faulkner
7275,7276,what is dd and he ask and they told him it meant done damn,gail hightow done damn in jefferson anyway they told him,faulkner
7277,7278,and how hightow had come straight to jefferson from the seminari refus to accept ani other call how he had pull everi string he could in order to be sent to jefferson,and how he arriv with hi young wife descend from the train in a state of excit alreadi talk tell the old men and women who were the pillar of the church how he had set hi mind on jefferson from the first sinc he had first decid to becom a minist tell them with a kind of glee of the letter he had written and the worri he had done and the influenc he had use in order to be call here,faulkner
7279,7280,to the peopl of the town it sound like a horsetrad s glee over an advantag trade,perhap that is how it sound to the elder,faulkner
7281,7282,becaus they listen to him with someth cold and astonish and dubiou sinc he sound like it wa the town he desir to live in and not the church and the peopl who compos the church that he want to serv,as if he did not care about the peopl the live peopl about whether they want him here or not,faulkner
7283,7284,and he be young too and the old men and the old women tri to talk down hi gleeful excit with seriou matter of the church and it respons and hi own,and they told byron how the young minist wa still excit even after six month still talk about the civil war and hi grandfath a cavalryman who wa kill and about gener grant s store burn in jefferson until it did not make sens at all,faulkner
7285,7286,they told byron how he seem to talk that way in the pulpit too wild too in the pulpit use religion as though it were a dream,not a nightmar but someth which went faster than the word in the book a sort of cyclon that did not even need to touch the actual earth,faulkner
7287,7288,and the old men and women did not like that either,it wa as if he couldn t get religion and that gallop cavalri and hi dead grandfath shot from the gallop hors untangl from each other even in the pulpit,faulkner
7289,7290,and that he could not untangl them in hi privat life at home either perhap,perhap he did not even tri to at home byron thought think how that is the sort of thing that men do to the women who belong to them think that that is whi women have to be strong and should not be held blamabl for what they do with or for or becaus of men sinc god knew that be anybodi s wife wa a tricki enough busi,faulkner
7291,7292,they told him how the wife wa a small quietlook girl who at first the town thought just had noth to say for herself,but the town said that if hightow had just been a more depend kind of man the kind of man a minist should be instead of be born about thirti year after the onli day he seem to have ever live day when hi grandfath wa shot from the gallop would have been all right too,faulkner
7293,7294,but he wa not and the neighbor would hear her weep in the parsonag in the afternoon or late at night and the neighbor know that the husband would not know what to do about it becaus he did not know what wa wrong,and how sometim she would not even come to the church where her own husband wa preach even on sunday and they would look at him and wonder if he even knew that she wa not there if he had not even forgot that he ever had a wife up there in the pulpit with hi hand fli around him and the dogma he wa suppos to preach all full of gallop cavalri and defeat and glori just as when he tri to tell them on the street about the gallop hors it in turn would get all mix up with absolut and choir of martial seraphim until it wa natur that the old men and women should believ that what he preach in god s own hous on god s own day verg on actual sacrileg,faulkner
7295,7296,and they told byron how after about a year in jefferson the wife began to wear that frozen look on her face and when the church ladi would go to call hightow would meet them alon in hi shirt sleev and without ani collar in a flurri and for a time it would seem as though he could not even think what they had come for and what he ought to do,then he would invit them in and excus himself and go out,faulkner
7297,7298,and they would not hear a sound anywher in the hous sit there in their sunday dress look at one anoth and about the room listen and not hear a sound,and then he would come back with hi coat and collar on and sit and talk with them about the church and the sick and they talk back bright and quiet still listen and mayb watch the door mayb wonder if he knew what they believ that they alreadi knew,faulkner
7299,7300,the ladi quit go there,soon they did not even see the minist s wife on the street,faulkner
7301,7302,and he still act like there wa noth wrong,and then she would be gone for a day or two they would see her get on the earli train with her face begin to get thin and gaunt as though she never ate enough and that frozen look on it as if she were not see what she wa look at,faulkner
7303,7304,and he would tell that she had gone to visit her peopl downstat somewher until one day dure one of her absenc a jefferson woman shop in memphi saw her walk fast into a hotel there,it wa one saturday that the woman return home and told it,faulkner
7305,7306,but the next day hightow wa in the pulpit with religion and the gallop cavalri all mix up again and the wife return monday and the follow sunday she came to church again for the first time in six or seven month sit by herself at the rear of the church,she came everi sunday after that for a while,faulkner
7307,7308,then she wa gone again in the middl of the week thi time it wa in juli and hot and hightow said that she had gone to see her folk again in the countri where it would be cool and the old men the elder and the old women watch him not know if he believ what he wa tell or not and the young peopl talk behind hi back,but they could not tell whether he himself believ or not what he told them if he care or not with hi religion and hi grandfath be shot from the gallop hors all mix up as though the seed which hi grandfath had transmit to him had been on the hors too that night and had been kill too and time had stop there and then for the seed and noth had happen in time sinc not even him,faulkner
7309,7310,the wife return befor sunday,it wa hot the old peopl said that it wa the hottest spell which the town had ever known,faulkner
7311,7312,she came to church that sunday and took her seat on a bench at the back alon,in the middl of the sermon she sprang from the bench and began to scream to shriek someth toward the pulpit shake her hand toward the pulpit where her husband had ceas talk lean forward with hi hand rais and stop,faulkner
7313,7314,some peopl nearbi tri to hold her but she fought them and they told byron how she stood there in the aisl now shriek and shake her hand at the pulpit where her husband lean with hi hand still rais and hi wild face frozen in the shape of the thunder and allegor period which he had not complet,they did not know whether she wa shake her hand at him or at god,faulkner
7315,7316,then he came down and approach and she stop fight then and he led her out with the head turn as they pass until the superintend told the organist to play,that afternoon the elder held a meet behind lock door,faulkner
7317,7318,the peopl did not know what went on behind them save that hightow return and enter the vestri room and close the door behind him too,but the peopl did not know what had happen,faulkner
7319,7320,they onli knew that the church made up a sum to send the wife to an institut a sanatorium and that hightow took her there and came back and preach the next sunday as usual,the women the neighbor some of whom had not enter the parsonag in month were kind to him take him dish now and then tell one anoth and their husband what a mess the parsonag wa in and how the minist seem to eat like an when he got hungri and just whatev he could find,faulkner
7321,7322,everi two week he would go and visit hi wife in the sanatorium but he alway return after a day or so and on sunday in the pulpit again it wa as though the whole thing had never happen,the peopl would ask about her health curiou and kind and he would thank them,faulkner
7323,7324,then sunday he would be again in the pulpit with hi wild hand and hi wild rapt eager voic in which like phantom god and salvat and the gallop hors and hi dead grandfath thunder while below him the elder sat and the congreg puzzl and outrag,in the fall the wife came home,faulkner
7325,7326,she look better,she had put on a littl flesh,faulkner
7327,7328,she had chang more than that even,perhap it wa that she seem chasten now awak anyway,faulkner
7329,7330,anyhow she wa now like the ladi had want her to be all the time as they believ that the minist s wife should be,she attend church and prayer meet regularli and the ladi call upon her and she call upon them sit quiet and humbl even in her own hous while they told her how to run it and what to wear and what to make her husband eat,faulkner
7331,7332,it might even be said that they forgav her,no crime or transgress had been actual name and no penanc had been actual set,faulkner
7333,7334,but the town did not believ that the ladi had forgot those previou mysteri trip with memphi as their destin and for that purpos regard which all had the same convict though none ever put it into word spoke it aloud sinc the town believ that good women don t forget thing easili good or bad lest the tast and savor of forgiv die from the palat of conscienc,becaus the town believ that the ladi knew the truth sinc it believ that bad women can be fool by bad sinc they have to spend some of their time not be suspici,faulkner
7335,7336,but that no good woman can be fool by it becaus by be good herself she doe not need to worri anymor about her or anybodi els s good henc she ha plenti of time to smell out sin,that wa whi they believ that good can fool her almost ani time into believ that it is evil but that evil itself can never fool her,faulkner
7337,7338,so when after four or five month the wife went away again on a visit and the husband said again that she had gone to visit her peopl the town believ that thi time even he wa not fool,anyway she came back and he went on preach everi sunday like noth had happen make hi call on the peopl and the sick and talk about the church,faulkner
7339,7340,but the wife did not come to church anymor and soon the ladi stop call on her go to the parsonag at all,and even the neighbor on either side would no longer see her about the hous,faulkner
7341,7342,and soon it wa as though she were not there as though everyon had agre that she wa not there that the minist did not even have a wife,and he preach to them everi sunday not even tell them now that she had gone to visit her peopl,faulkner
7343,7344,mayb he wa glad of that the town thought,mayb he wa glad to not have to lie anymor,faulkner
7345,7346,so nobodi saw her when she got on the train that friday or mayb it wa saturday the day itself,it wa sunday morn s paper which they saw tell how she had jump or fallen from a hotel window in memphi saturday night and wa dead,faulkner
7347,7348,there had been a man in the room with her,he wa arrest,faulkner
7349,7350,he wa drunk,they were regist as man and wife under a fictiti name,faulkner
7351,7352,the polic found her right name where she had written it herself on a piec of paper and then torn it up and thrown it into the wast basket,the paper print it with the stori wife of the reverend gail hightow of jefferson mississippi,faulkner
7353,7354,and the stori told how the paper telephon to the husband at two am,and how the husband said that he had noth to say,faulkner
7355,7356,and when they reach the church that sunday morn the yard wa full of memphi report take pictur of the church and the parsonag,then hightow came,faulkner
7357,7358,the report tri to stop him but he walk right through them and into the church and up into the pulpit,the old ladi and some of the old men were alreadi in the church horrifi and outrag not so much about the memphi busi as about the presenc of the report,faulkner
7359,7360,but when hightow came in and actual went up into the pulpit they forgot about the report even,the ladi got up first and began to leav,faulkner
7361,7362,then the men got up too and then the church wa empti save for the minist in the pulpit lean a littl forward with the book open and hi hand prop on either side of it and hi head not bow either and the memphi report they had follow him into the church sit in a line in the rear pew,they said he wa not watch hi congreg leav he wa not look at anyth,faulkner
7363,7364,they told byron about it about how at last the minist close the book care and came down into the empti church and walk up the aisl without onc look at the row of report like the congreg had done and went out the door,there were some photograph wait out in front with the camera all set up and their head under the black cloth,faulkner
7365,7366,the minist had evid expect thi,becaus he emerg from the church with an open hymn book held befor hi face,faulkner
7367,7368,but the cameramen had evid expect that too,becaus they fool him,faulkner
7369,7370,veri like he wa not use to it and so wa easili fool they told byron,one of the cameramen had hi machin set up to one side and the minist did not see that one at all or until too late,faulkner
7371,7372,he wa keep hi face conceal from the one in front and next day when the pictur came out in the paper it had been taken from the side with the minist in the middl of a step hold the hymn book befor hi face,and behind the book hi lip were drawn back as though he were smile,faulkner
7373,7374,but hi teeth were tight togeth and hi face look like the face of satan in the old print,the next day he brought hi wife home and buri her,faulkner
7375,7376,the town came to the ceremoni,it wa not a funer,faulkner
7377,7378,he did not take the bodi to the church at all,he took it straight to the cemeteri and he wa prepar to read from the book himself when anoth minist came forward and took it from hi hand,faulkner
7379,7380,a lot of the peopl the younger one remain after he and the other had gone look at the grave,then even the member of the other church knew that hi own had ask him to resign and that he refus,faulkner
7381,7382,the next sunday a lot of them from the other church came to hi church to see what would happen,he came and enter the church,faulkner
7383,7384,the congreg as one rose and walk out leav the minist and those from the other church who had come as though to a show,so he preach to them as he had alway preach with that rapt furi which they had consid sacrileg and which those from the other church believ to be out and out insan,faulkner
7385,7386,he would not resign,the elder ask the church board to recal him,faulkner
7387,7388,but after the stori the pictur in the paper and all no other town would have him either,there wa noth against him person they all insist,faulkner
7389,7390,he wa just unlucki,he wa just born unlucki,faulkner
7391,7392,so the peopl quit come to the church at all even the one from the other church who had come out of curios for a time he wa no longer even a show now he wa now onli an outrag,but he would reach the church at the old hour each sunday morn and go to the pulpit and the congreg would rise and leav and the loafer and such would gather along the street outsid and listen to him preach and pray in the empti church,faulkner
7393,7394,and the sunday after that when he arriv the door wa lock and the loafer watch him tri the door and then desist and stand there with hi face still not bow with the street line with men who never went to church anyway and littl boy who did not know exactli what it wa but that it wa someth stop and look with still round eye at the man stand quit motionless befor the lock door,the next day the town heard how he had gone to the elder and resign hi pulpit for the good of the church,faulkner
7395,7396,then the town wa sorri with be glad as peopl sometim are sorri for those whom they have at last forc to do as they want them to,they thought of cours that he would go away now and the church made up a collect for him to go away on and settl somewher els,faulkner
7397,7398,then he refus to leav the town,they told byron of the constern the more than outrag when they learn that he had bought the littl hous on the back street where he now live and ha live ever sinc and the elder held anoth meet becaus they said that they had given him the money to go away on and when he spent it for someth els he had accept the money under fals pretenc,faulkner
7399,7400,they went to him and told him so,he ask them to excus him he return to the room with the sum which had been given him to the exact penni and in the exact denomin and insist that they take it back,faulkner
7401,7402,but they refus and he would not tell where he had got the money to buy the hous with,so by the next day they told byron there were some who said that he had insur hi wife s life and then paid someon to murder her,faulkner
7403,7404,but everyon knew that thi wa not so includ the one who told and repeat it and the one who listen when it wa told,but he would not leav the town,faulkner
7405,7406,then one day they saw the littl sign which he had made and paint himself and set in hi front yard and they knew that he meant to stay,he still kept the cook a negro woman,faulkner
7407,7408,he had had her all the time,but they told byron how as soon as hi wife wa dead the peopl seem to realis all at onc that the negro wa a woman that he had that negro woman in the hous alon with him all day,faulkner
7409,7410,and how the wife wa hardli cold in the shame grave befor the whisper began,about how he had made hi wife go bad and commit suicid becaus he wa not a natur husband a natur man and that the negro woman wa the reason,faulkner
7411,7412,and that s all it took all that wa lack,byron listen quietli think to himself how peopl everywher are about the same but that it did seem that in a small town where evil is harder to accomplish where opportun for privaci are scarcer that peopl can invent more of it in other peopl s name,faulkner
7413,7414,becaus that wa all it requir that idea that singl idl word blown from mind to mind,one day the cook quit,faulkner
7415,7416,they heard how one night a parti of carelessli mask men went to the minist s hous and order him to fire her,then they heard how the next day the woman told that she quit herself becaus her employ ask her to do someth which she said wa against god and natur,faulkner
7417,7418,and it wa said that some mask men had scare her into quit becaus she wa what is known as a high brown and it wa known that there were two or three men in the town who would object to her do whatev it wa which she consid contrari to god and natur sinc as some of the younger men said if a nigger woman consid it against god and natur it must be pretti bad,anyway the minist couldn didn anoth woman cook,faulkner
7419,7420,possibl the men scare all the other negro women in town that same night,so he did hi own cook for a while until they heard one day that he had a negro man to cook for him,faulkner
7421,7422,and that finish him sure enough,becaus that even some men not mask either took the negro man out and whip him,faulkner
7423,7424,and when hightow wake the next morn hi studi window wa broken and on the floor lay a brick with a note tie to it command him to get out of town by sunset and sign kkk,and he did not go and on the second morn a man found him in the wood about a mile from town,faulkner
7425,7426,he had been tie to a tree and beaten unconsci,he refus to tell who had done it,faulkner
7427,7428,the town knew that that wa wrong and some of the men came to him and tri again to persuad him to leav jefferson for hi own good tell him that next time they might kill him,but he refus to leav,faulkner
7429,7430,he would not even talk about the beat even when they offer to prosecut the men who had done it,but he would do neither,faulkner
7431,7432,he would neither tell nor depart,then all of a sudden the whole thing seem to blow away like an evil wind,faulkner
7433,7434,it wa as though the town realis at last that he would be a part of it life until he die and that they might as well becom reconcil,as though byron thought the entir affair had been a lot of peopl perform a play and that now and at last they had all play out the part which had been allot them and now they could live quietli with one anoth,faulkner
7435,7436,they let the minist alon,they would see him work in the yard or the garden and on the street and in the store with a small basket on hi arm and they would speak to him,faulkner
7437,7438,they knew that he did hi own cook and housework and after a while the neighbor began to send him dish again though they were the sort of dish which they would have sent to a poor mill famili,but it wa food and wellmeant,faulkner
7439,7440,becaus as byron thought peopl forget a lot in twenti year,whi he think i don t reckon there is anybodi in jefferson that know that he sit in that window from sundown to full dark everi day that come except me,faulkner
7441,7442,or what the insid of that hous look like,and they don t even know that i know or like they d take us both out and whip us again sinc folk don t seem to forget much longer than they rememb becaus there is one other thing which came into byron s own knowledg and observ in hi own time sinc he came to jefferson to live,faulkner
7443,7444,hightow read a great deal,that is byron had examin with a kind of muse and respect constern the book which line the studi wall book of religion and histori and scienc of whose veri exist byron had never heard,faulkner
7445,7446,one day about four year ago a negro man came run up to the minist s hous from hi cabin on the edg of town immedi behind it and said that hi wife wa at childb,hightow had no telephon and he told the negro to run next door and call a doctor,faulkner
7447,7448,he watch the negro go to the gate of the next hous,but instead of enter the negro stood there for a time and then went on up the street toward town walk hightow knew that the man would walk all the way to town and then spend probabl thirti minut more get in touch with a doctor in hi fumbl and timeless negro fashion instead of ask some white woman to telephon for him,faulkner
7449,7450,then he went to hi kitchen door and he could hear the woman in the not so distant cabin wail,he wait no longer,faulkner
7451,7452,he ran down to the cabin and found that the woman had got out of bed for what reason he never learn and she wa now on her hand and knee on the floor tri to get back into the bed scream and wail,he got her back into the bed and told her to lie still frighten her into obey him and ran back to hi hous and took one of the book from the studi shelf and got hi razor and some cord and ran back to the cabin and deliv the child,faulkner
7453,7454,but it wa alreadi dead the doctor when arriv said that she had doubtless injur it when she left the bed where hightow found her,he also approv of hightow s work and the husband wa satisfi too,faulkner
7455,7456,but it wa just too close to that other busi byron thought even despit the fifteen year between them becaus within two day there were those who said that the child wa hightow s and that he had let it die deliber,but byron believ that even the one who said thi did not believ it,faulkner
7457,7458,he believ that the town had had the habit of say thing about the disgrac minist which they did not believ themselv for too long a time to break themselv of it,becaus alway he think when anyth get to be a habit it also manag to get a right good distanc away from truth and fact and he rememb one even when he and hightow were talk togeth and hightow said they are good peopl,faulkner
7459,7460,they must believ what they must believ especi as it wa i who wa at one time both master and servant of their believ,and so it is not for me to outrag their believ nor for byron bunch to say that they are wrong,faulkner
7461,7462,becaus all that ani man can hope for is to be permit to live quietli among hi fellows that wa soon after byron had heard the stori shortli after the even visit to hightow s studi began and byron still wonder whi the other remain in jefferson almost within sight of and within hear of the church which had disown and expel him,one even byron ask him,faulkner
7463,7464,whi do you spend your saturday afternoon work at the mill while other men are take pleasur down town hightow said,i don t know byron said,faulkner
7465,7466,but i know now whi it is byron think,it is becaus a fellow is more afraid of the troubl he might have than he ever is of the troubl he s alreadi got,faulkner
7467,7468,he ll cling to troubl he s use to befor he ll risk a chang,ye,faulkner
7469,7470,a man will talk about how he d like to escap from live folk,but it s the dead folk that do him the damag,faulkner
7471,7472,yet he still sit at the studi window the room still dark behind him,the street lamp at the corner flicker and glare so that the bitten shadow of the unwind mapl seem to toss faintli upon the august dark,faulkner
7473,7474,from a distanc quit faint though quit clear he can hear the sonor wave of mass voic from the church a sound at onc auster and rich abject and proud swell and fall in the quiet summer dark like a harmon tide,then he see a man approach along the street,faulkner
7475,7476,on a week night he would have recognis the figur the shape the carriag and gait,but on sunday even and with the echo of the phantom hoov still crash soundlessli in the duskfil studi he watch quietli the puni unhors figur move with that precari and meretrici clever of anim balanc on their hinder leg that clever of which the man anim is so fatuous proud and which constantli betray him by mean of natur law like graviti and ice and by the veri extran object which he ha himself invent like motor car and furnitur in the dark and the veri refus of hi own eat left upon floor or pavement and he think quietli how right the ancient were in make the hors an attribut and symbol of warrior and king when he see the man in the street pass the low sign and turn into hi gate and approach the hous,faulkner
7477,7478,he sit forward then watch the man come up the dark walk toward the dark door he hear the man stumbl heavili at the dark bottom step,byron bunch he say,faulkner
7479,7480,in town on sunday night,the studi is light now by a greenshad read lamp sit upon the desk,faulkner
7481,7482,hightow sit behind it in an ancient swivel chair byron in a straight chair opposit,both their face are just without the direct downward pool of light from the shade lamp,faulkner
7483,7484,through the open window the sound of sing from the distant church come,byron talk in a flat level voic,faulkner
7485,7486,it wa a strang thing,i thought that if there ever wa a place where a man would be where the chanc to do harm could not have found him it would have been out there at the mill on a saturday even,faulkner
7487,7488,and with the hous burn too right in my face you might say,it wa like all the time i wa eat dinner and i would look up now and then and see that smoke and i would think well i won t see a soul out here thi even anyway,faulkner
7489,7490,i ain t go to be interrupt thi even at least and then i look up and there she wa with her face all fix for smile and with her mouth all fix to say hi name when she saw that i wasn t him,and i never know ani better than to blab the whole thing he grimac faintli,faulkner
7491,7492,it is not a smile,hi upper lip just lift momentarili the movement even the surfac wrinkl travel no further and vanish almost at onc,faulkner
7493,7494,but she wa look for him,and you help her to find him,faulkner
7495,7496,i reckon it ain t ani question about that,with her watch me sit there swolebelli watch me with them eye that a man could not have lie to if he had want,faulkner
7497,7498,the hous that burn yesterday,but i don t see ani connect hous wa it,faulkner
7499,7500,he look at the other,they look at one anoth,faulkner
7501,7502,hightow is a tall man and he wa thin onc,but he is not thin now,faulkner
7503,7504,hi skin is the color of flour sack and hi upper bodi in shape is like a loos fill sack fall from hi gaunt shoulder of it own weight upon hi lap,then byron say you ain t heard yet the other watch him,faulkner
7505,7506,he say in a muse tone that would be for me to do too,but hightow s face is mere grave and interest,faulkner
7507,7508,brown and christma byron say,still hightow s face doe not chang in express,faulkner
7509,7510,you ain t heard that even byron say,in a old nigger cabin in the back,faulkner
7511,7512,christma fix it up three year ago,he s been live in it ever sinc with folk wonder where he slept at night,faulkner
7513,7514,they were sell whiskey use that old place for a headquart a blind,i don t reckon she knew that about the whiskey,faulkner
7515,7516,leastway folk don t know if she ever knew or not,they say that christma start it by himself three year ago just sell to a few regular custom that didn t even know one anoth,faulkner
7517,7518,but when he took brown in with him i reckon brown want to spread out,sell it by the half a pint out of hi shirt bosom in ani alley and to anybodi,faulkner
7519,7520,sell what he never drunk that is,and i reckon the way they got the whiskey they sold would not have stood much look into,faulkner
7521,7522,becaus about two week after brown quit out at the mill and taken to ride around in that new car for hi steadi work he wa down town drunk one saturday night and brag to a crowd in the barbershop someth about him and christma in memphi one night or on a road close to memphi,someth about them and that new car hid in the bush and christma with a pistol and a lot more about a truck and a hundr gallon of someth until christma come in quick and walk up to him and jerk him out of the chair,faulkner
7523,7524,and christma say in that quiet voic of hi that ain t pleasant and ain t mad either you ought to be care about drink so much of thi jefferson hair tonic,it s gone to your head,faulkner
7525,7526,first thing you know you ll have a hairlip hold brown up he wa with one hand and slap hi face with the other,they didn t look like hard lick,faulkner
7527,7528,but the folk could see the red even through brown s whisker when christma hand would come away between lick,you come out and get some fresh air christma say,faulkner
7529,7530,you re keep these folk from working he muse,he speak again and there she wa sit there on them stave watch me and me blab the whole thing to her and her watch me,faulkner
7531,7532,he sit motionless watch byron with a sort of quiet astonish,there is noth milit in it noth of outrag moral,faulkner
7533,7534,it is as though he were listen to the do of peopl of a differ race,her husband a bootlegg,faulkner
7535,7536,well well well yet byron can see in the other s face someth latent about to wake of which hightow himself is unawar as if someth insid the man were tri to warn or prepar him,but byron think that thi is just the reflect of what he himself alreadi know and is about to tell,faulkner
7537,7538,and so i had alreadi told her befor i knew it,and i could have bit my tongu in two even then even when i thought that that wa all he is not look at the other now,faulkner
7539,7540,through the window faint yet clear the blend organ and voic come from the distant church across the still even,i wonder if he hear it too byron think,faulkner
7541,7542,or mayb he ha listen to it so much and so long that he don t even hear it anymor,don t even need to not listen,faulkner
7543,7544,and she set there all the even while i work and the smoke die away at last and me tri to think what to tell her and what to do,she want to go right on out there for me to tell her the way,faulkner
7545,7546,when i told her it wa two mile she just kind of smile like i wa a child or someth,i done come all the way from alabama she said,faulkner
7547,7548,i reckon i ain t go to worri about two mile more and then i told her hi voic ceas,he appear to contempl the floor at hi feet,faulkner
7549,7550,he look up,i lie i reckon,faulkner
7551,7552,onli in a way it wa not a lie,it wa becaus i know there would be folk out there watch the fire and her come up tri to find him,faulkner
7553,7554,i didn t know myself then the other,the rest of it,faulkner
7555,7556,the worst of it,so i told her that he wa busi at a job he had and that the best time to find him would be down town after six o clock,faulkner
7557,7558,and that wa the truth,becaus i reckon he doe call it work carri all them cold littl bottl nekkid against hi chest and if he ever wa away from the squar it wa just becaus he wa a littl behind in get back or had just step into a alley for a minut,faulkner
7559,7560,so i persuad her to wait and she set there and i went on work tri to decid what to do,when i think now how worri i wa on what littl i know now when i know the rest of it it don t seem like i had anyth then to worri me at all,faulkner
7561,7562,it is not your fault that the man is what he is or she what she is,you did what you could,faulkner
7563,7564,all that ani stranger could be expect to do,unless hi voic ceas also,faulkner
7565,7566,then it die away on that inflect as if idl think had becom specul and then someth like concern,opposit him byron sit without move hi face lower and grave,faulkner
7567,7568,and opposit byron hightow doe not yet think love,he rememb onli that byron is still young and ha led a life of celibaci and hard labor and that by byron s tell the woman whom he ha never seen possess some disturb qualiti at least even though byron still believ that it is onli piti,faulkner
7569,7570,so he watch byron now with a certain narrow neither cold nor warm while byron continu in that flat voic about how at six o clock he had still decid on noth that when he and lena reach the squar he wa still undecid,and now there begin to come into hightow s puzzl express a qualiti of shrink and forebod as byron talk quietli tell about how he decid after they reach the squar to take lena on to mr,faulkner
7571,7572,beard s,and byron talk quietli think rememb it wa like someth gone through the air the even make the familiar face of men appear strang and he who had not yet heard without have to know that someth had happen which made of the former dilemma of hi innoc a matter for children so that he knew befor he knew what had happen that lena must not hear about it,faulkner
7573,7574,he did not even have to be told in word that he had sure found the lost luca burch it seem to him now that onli crassest fatuous and imbecil should have kept unawar,it seem to him that fate circumst had a warn in the sky all day long in that pillar of yellow smoke and he too stupid to read it,faulkner
7575,7576,and so he would not let them men whom they pass the air that blew upon them full of she hear too,perhap he knew at the time that she would have to know hear it sooner or later that in a way it wa her right to know,faulkner
7577,7578,it just seem to him that if he could onli get her across the squar and into a hous hi respons would be discharg,not respons for the evil to which he held himself for no other reason than that of have spent the afternoon with her while it wa happen have been chosen by circumst to repres jefferson to her who had come afoot and without money for thirti day in order to reach there,faulkner
7579,7580,he did not hope nor intend to avoid that respons,it wa just to give himself and her time to be shock and surpris,faulkner
7581,7582,he tell it quietli fumbl hi face lower in hi flat inflectionless voic while across the desk hightow watch him with that express of shrink and denial,they reach the board hous at last and enter it,faulkner
7583,7584,it wa as though she felt forebod too watch him as they stood in the hall speak for the first time what is it them men were tri to tell you,mayb not hurt at all,faulkner
7585,7586,just folk talk like as not,like they will he could not look at her meet her eye at all,faulkner
7587,7588,but he could feel her watch him and he seem to hear a myriad sound voic the hush tens voic about the town about the squar through which he had hurri her where men met among the safe and familiar light tell it,the hous too seem fill with familiar sound but mostli with inertia a terribl procrastin as he gaze down the dim hall think whi don t she come on,faulkner
7589,7590,whi don t she come on then mr,beard did come a comfort woman with red arm and untidi grayish hair,faulkner
7591,7592,thi here is miz burch he said,hi express wa almost a glare importun urgent,faulkner
7593,7594,she just got to town from alabama,she is look to meet her husband here,faulkner
7595,7596,he ain t come yet,so i brought her here where she can rest some befor she get mix up in the excit of town,faulkner
7597,7598,she ain t been in town or talk to anybodi yet and so i thought mayb you could fix her up a place to get rest some befor she ha to hear talk and hi voic ceas die recapitul urgent importun,then he believ that she had got hi mean,faulkner
7599,7600,later he knew that it wa not becaus of hi ask that she refrain from tell what he knew that she had also heard but becaus she had alreadi notic the pregnanc and that she would have kept the matter hidden anyway,she look at lena onc complet as strang women had been do for four week now,faulkner
7601,7602,how long doe she aim to stay mr,beard said,faulkner
7603,7604,just a night or two byron said,mayb just tonight,faulkner
7605,7606,she s look to meet her husband here,she just got in and she ain t had time to ask or hi voic wa still recapitul meaning,faulkner
7607,7608,mr,beard watch him now,faulkner
7609,7610,he thought that she wa still tri to get hi mean,but what she wa do wa watch him grope believ or about to believ that hi fumbl had a differ reason and mean,faulkner
7611,7612,then she look at lena again,her eye were not exactli cold,faulkner
7613,7614,but they were not warm,i reckon she ain t got ani busi tri to go anywher right now she said,faulkner
7615,7616,that s what i thought byron said quickli eagerli,beard said immedi,faulkner
7617,7618,you ll be take out in a few minut anyway,he did not look away,faulkner
7619,7620,i won t be abl to go thi time he look straight into cold alreadi disbeliev eye watch her in turn tri to read hi own believ that she read what wa there instead of what she believ wa there,they say that it is the practic liar who can deceiv,faulkner
7621,7622,but so often the practic and chronic liar deceiv onli himself it is the man who all hi life ha been selfconvict of verac whose lie find quickest credenc,oh mr,faulkner
7623,7624,beard said,she look at lena again,faulkner
7625,7626,not thi side of alabama,like mr,faulkner
7627,7628,beard said,where are you go to sleep but she did not wait for an answer,faulkner
7629,7630,i reckon i can fix her up a cot in my room for tonight,he had found a chanc to speak to mr,faulkner
7631,7632,beard,he had spent more time in invent that lie than ani yet,faulkner
7633,7634,and then it wa not necessari that which he wa tri to shield wa it own protect,them men will be talk about it at the tabl mr,faulkner
7635,7636,beard said,i reckon a woman in her shape and have to find a husband name burch at the same time she thought with dri ironi ain t got no busi listen to ani more of man s devil,faulkner
7637,7638,you bring her in later after they have all et which byron did,lena ate heartili again with that grave and hearti decorum almost go to sleep in her plate befor she had finish,faulkner
7639,7640,it s right tire travel is she explain,you go set in the parlor and i ll fix your cot mr,faulkner
7641,7642,beard said,i d like to help lena said,faulkner
7643,7644,but even byron could see that she would not that she wa dead for sleep,you go set in the parlor mr,faulkner
7645,7646,beard said,i reckon mr,faulkner
7647,7648,beyond the desk hightow ha not move,and there we wa set at the veri time when it wa all come out down town at the sheriff offic at the veri time when brown wa tell it all about him and christma and the whiskey and all,faulkner
7649,7650,onli the whiskey wasn t much news to folk not sinc he had took brown for a partner,i reckon the onli thing folk wonder about wa whi christma ever took up with brown,faulkner
7651,7652,mayb it wa becaus like not onli find like it can t even escap from be found by it like,even when it s just like in one thing becaus even them two with the same like wa differ,faulkner
7653,7654,christma dare the law to make money and brown dare the law becaus he never even had sens enough to know he wa do it,like that night in the barbershop and him drunk and talk loud until christma kind of run in and drag him out,faulkner
7655,7656,and mr,maxey said what do you reckon that wa he pretti near told on himself and that other one and captain mclendon said i don t reckon about it at all and mr,faulkner
7657,7658,but everybodi knew about that,they had been say for a good while that somebodi ought to tell miss burden,faulkner
7659,7660,but i reckon there wasn t anybodi that want to go out there and tell her becaus nobodi know what wa go to happen then,i reckon there are folk born here that never even saw her,faulkner
7661,7662,i don t reckon i d want to go out there to that old hous where nobodi ever saw her unless mayb it wa folk in a pass wagon that would see her now and then stand in the yard in a dress and sunbonnet that some nigger women i know wouldn t have wore for it shape and how it made her look,or mayb she alreadi knew it,faulkner
7663,7664,be a yanke and all mayb she didn t mind,and then couldn t nobodi have known what wa go to happen,faulkner
7665,7666,and so i didn t dare leav her alon until she wa in bed,i aim to come out and see you last night right away,faulkner
7667,7668,but i never dare to leav her,them other boarder wa pass up and down the hall and i didn t know when one of them would take a notion to come in and start talk about it and tell the whole thing i could alreadi hear them talk about it on the porch and her still watch me with her face all fix to ask me again about that fire,faulkner
7669,7670,and so i didn t dare leav her,and we wa set there in the parlor and she couldn t hardli keep her eye open then and me tell her how i would find him for her all right onli i want to come and talk to a preacher i know that could help her to get in touch with him,faulkner
7671,7672,and her set there with her eye close while i wa tell her not know that i knew that her and that fellow wasn t marri yet,she thought she had fool everybodi,faulkner
7673,7674,and she ask me what kind of a man it wa that i aim to tell about her to and i told her and her set there with her eye close so that at last i said you ain t heard a word i been say and she kind of rous up but without open her eye and said can he still marri folk and i said what,he sit erect behind the desk hi forearm parallel upon the armrest of the chair,faulkner
7675,7676,he wear neither collar nor coat,hi face is at onc gaunt and flabbi it is as though there were two face one impos upon the other look out from beneath the pale bald skull surround by a fring of gray hair from behind the twin motionless glare of hi spectacl,faulkner
7677,7678,that part of hi torso visibl abov the desk is shapeless almost monstrou with a soft and sedentari obes,he sit rigid on hi face now that express of denial and flight ha becom definit,faulkner
7679,7680,byron he say byron,he look quietli at the other with an express of commiser and piti,faulkner
7681,7682,i know you had not heard yet,about yesterday and christma,faulkner

7685,7686,he doe not move,for a moment longer he doe not move,faulkner
7687,7688,then there seem to come over hi whole bodi as if it part were mobil like face featur that shrink and denial and byron see that the still flaccid big face is suddenli slick with sweat,but hi voic is light and calm,faulkner
7689,7690,what about christma and brown and yesterday he say,the sound of music from the distant church ha long sinc ceas,faulkner

7693,7694,between hi parallel and downturn palm and with hi lower bodi conceal by the desk hi attitud is that of an eastern idol,it wa yesterday morn,faulkner
7695,7696,there wa a countryman come to town in a wagon with hi famili,he wa the one that found the fire,faulkner

7699,7700,they don t know it s afir she said i reckon,you go up there and tell them and he got out of the wagon and went up onto the porch and stood there holler hello,faulkner
7701,7702,hello for a while,he told how he could hear the fire then insid the hous and then he hit the door a lick with hi shoulder and went in and then he found the one that had found that fire first,faulkner
7703,7704,it wa brown,but the countryman didn t know that,faulkner

7707,7708,but the countryman knew there couldn t be that much fire upstair becaus the fire wa all back toward the kitchen,and besid the man wa too drunk to know anyway,faulkner
7709,7710,and he told how he suspect there wa someth wrong from the way the drunk man wa tri to keep him from go upstair,so he start upstair and the drunk fellow tri to hold him back and he shove the drunk man away and went on up the stair,faulkner

7721,7722,and how he wa afraid to tri to pick her up and carri her out becaus her head might come clean off,and then he said how he run back down the stair again and out the front without even notic that the drunk fellow wa gone and down to the road and told hi wife to whip the team on to the nearest telephon and call for the sheriff too,faulkner
7723,7724,and how he run back around the hous to the cistern and he said he wa alreadi draw up a bucket of water befor he realis how foolish that wa with the whole back end of the hous afir good now,so he run back into the hous and up the stair again and into the room and jerk a cover off the bed and roll her onto it and caught up the corner and swung it onto hi back like a sack of meal and carri it out of the hous and laid it down under a tree,faulkner
7725,7726,and he said that what he wa scare of happen,becaus the cover fell open and she wa lay on her side face one way and her head wa turn clean around like she wa look behind her,faulkner
7727,7728,hightow ha not move,hi face about the twin blank glare of the spectacl is sweat quietli and steadili,faulkner
7729,7730,and the sheriff come out and the fire depart come too,but there wasn t noth it could do becaus there wasn t ani water for the hose,faulkner

10647,10648,none of it,and we were foreign stranger that thought differ from the peopl whose countri we had come into without be ask or want,faulkner
10649,10650,and he wa french half of him,enough french to respect anybodi s love for the land where he and hi peopl were born and to understand that a man would have to act as the land where he wa born had train him to act,faulkner
10651,10652,it wa as though he had fallen into a sewer,as upon anoth life he look back upon that first hard and manlik surrend that surrend terrif and hard like the break down of a spiritu skeleton the veri sound of whose snap fiber could be heard almost by the physic ear so that the act of capitul wa anticlimax as when a defeat gener on the day after the last battl shave overnight and with hi boot clean of the mud of combat surrend hi sword to a committe,faulkner
10653,10654,the sewer ran onli by night,the day were the same as they had ever been,faulkner
10655,10656,he went to work at half past six in the morn,he would leav the cabin without look toward the hous at all,faulkner
10657,10658,at six in the even he return again without even look toward the hous,he wash and chang to the white shirt and the dark creas trouser and went to the kitchen and found hi supper wait on the tabl and he sat and ate it still without have seen her at all,faulkner
10659,10660,but he knew that she wa in the hous and that the come of dark within the old wall wa break down someth and leav it corrupt with wait,he knew how she had spent the day that her day also were no differ from what they had alway been as if in her case too anoth person had live them,faulkner
10661,10662,all day long he would imagin her go about her housework sit for that unvari period at the scar desk or talk listen to the negro women who came to the hous from both direct up and down the road follow path which had been year in the wear and which radiat from the hous like wheelspok,what they talk about to her he did not know though he had watch them approach the hous in a manner not exactli secret yet purpos enter usual singli though sometim in two and three in their apron and headrag and now and then with a man s coat thrown about their shoulder emerg again and return down the radiat path not fast and yet not loiter,faulkner
10663,10664,they would be brief in hi mind think now she is do thi,now she is do that not think much about her,faulkner
10665,10666,he believ that dure the day she thought no more about him than he did about her too,even when at night in her dark bedroom she insist on tell him in tediou detail the trivial matter of her day and insist on hi tell her of hi day in turn it wa in the fashion of lover that imperi and insati demand that the trivial detail of both day be put into word without ani need to listen to the tell,faulkner
10667,10668,then he would finish hi supper and go to her where she wait,often he would not hurri,faulkner
10669,10670,as time went on and the novelti of the second phase began to wear off and becom habit he would stand in the kitchen door and look out across the dusk and see perhap with forebod and premonit the savag and lone street which he had chosen of hi own will wait for him think thi is not my life,i don t belong here,faulkner
10671,10672,at first it shock him the abject furi of the new england glacier expos suddenli to the fire of the new england biblic hell,perhap he wa awar of the abneg in it the imperi and fierc urgenc that conceal an actual despair at frustrat and irrevoc year which she appear to attempt to compens each night as if she believ that it would be the last night on earth by damn herself forev to the hell of her forefath by live not alon in sin but in filth,faulkner
10673,10674,she had an avid for the forbidden wordsymbol an insati appetit for the sound of them on hi tongu and on her own,she reveal the terribl and imperson curios of a child about forbidden subject and object that rapt and tireless and detach interest of a surgeon in the physic bodi and it possibl,faulkner
10675,10676,and by day he would see the calm coldfac almost manlik almost middleag woman who had live for twenti year alon without ani feminin fear at all in a lone hous in a neighborhood popul when at all by negro who spent a certain portion of each day sit tranquilli at a desk and write tranquilli for the eye of both youth and age the practic advic of a combin priest and banker and train nurs,dure that period it could not be call a honeymoon christma watch her pass through everi avatar of a woman in love,faulkner
10677,10678,soon she more than shock him she astonish and bewild him,she surpris and took him unawar with fit of jealou rage,faulkner
10679,10680,she could have had no such experi at all and there wa neither reason for the scene nor ani possibl protagonist he knew that she knew that,it wa as if she had invent the whole thing deliber for the purpos of play it out like a play,faulkner
10681,10682,yet she did it with such furi with such convincing and such convict that on the first occas he thought that she wa under a delus and the third time he thought that she wa mad,she reveal an unexpect and infal instinct for intrigu,faulkner
10683,10684,she insist on a place for conceal note letter,it wa in a hollow fenc post below the rot stabl,faulkner
10685,10686,he never saw her put a note there yet she insist on hi visit it daili when he did so the letter would be there,when he did not and lie to her he would find that she had alreadi set trap to catch him in the lie she cri wept,faulkner
10687,10688,sometim the note would tell him not to come until a certain hour to that hous which no white person save himself had enter in year and in which for twenti year now she had been all night alon for a whole week she forc him to climb into a window to come to her,he would do so and sometim he would have to seek her about the dark hous until he found her hidden in closet in empti room wait pant her eye in the dark glow like the eye of cat,faulkner
10689,10690,now and then she appoint tryst beneath certain shrub about the ground where he would find her nake or with her cloth half torn to ribbon upon her in the wild throe of nymphomania her bodi gleam in the slow shift from one to anoth of such formal erot attitud and gestur as a beardsley of the time of petroniu might have drawn,she would be wild then in the close breath halfdark without wall with her wild hair each strand of which would seem to come aliv like octopu tentacl and her wild hand and her breath negro,faulkner
10691,10692,negro,it could not be said that he corrupt her,faulkner
10693,10694,hi own life for all it anonym promiscu had been convent enough as a life of healthi and normal sin usual is,the corrupt came from a sourc even more inexplic to him than to her,faulkner
10695,10696,in fact it wa as though with the corrupt which she seem to gather from the air itself she began to corrupt him,he began to be afraid,faulkner
10697,10698,he could not have said of what,but he began to see himself as from a distanc like a man be suck down into a bottomless morass,faulkner
10699,10700,he had not exactli thought that yet,what he wa now see wa the street lone savag and cool,faulkner
10701,10702,that wa it cool he wa think say aloud to himself sometim i better move,meanwhil the affair went on submerg him more and more by the imperi and overrid furi of those night,faulkner
10703,10704,perhap he realis that he could not escap,anyway he stay watch the two creatur that struggl in the one bodi like two moongleam shape struggl drown in altern throe upon the surfac of a black thick pool beneath the last moon,faulkner
10705,10706,now it would be that still cold contain figur of the first phase who even though lost and damn remain somehow impervi and impregn then it would be the other the second one who in furiou denial of that impregn strove to drown in the black abyss of it own creat that physic puriti which had been preserv too long now even to be lost,now and then they would come to the black surfac lock like sister the black water would drain away,faulkner
10707,10708,then the world would rush back the room the wall the peac myriad sound of in sect from beyond the summer window where insect had whir for forti year,the end of thi phase wa not sharp not a climax like the first,faulkner
10709,10710,it merg into the third phase so gradual that he could not have said where one stop and the other began it wa summer becom fall with alreadi like shadow befor a welter sun the chill and implac import of autumn cast ahead upon summer someth of die summer spurt again like a die coal in the fall,thi wa over a period of two year,faulkner
10711,10712,he still work at the plane mill and in the meantim he had begun to sell a littl whiskey veri judici restrict himself to a few discreet custom none of whom knew the other,she did not know thi although he kept hi stock hidden on the place and met hi client in the wood beyond the pastur,faulkner
10713,10714,veri like she would not have object,but neither would mr,faulkner
10715,10716,mceachern have object to the hidden rope perhap he did not tell her for the same reason that he did not tell mr,mceachern,faulkner
10717,10718,think of mr,mceachern and the rope and of the waitress whom he had never told where the money came from which he gave to her and now of hi present mistress and the whiskey he could almost believ that it wa not to make money that he sold the whiskey but becaus he wa doom to conceal alway someth from the women who surround him,faulkner
10719,10720,meanwhil he would see her from a distanc now and then in the daytim about the rear premis where move articul beneath the clean auster garment which she wore that rotten rich readi to flow into putrefact at a touch like someth grow in a swamp not onc look toward the cabin or toward him,and when he thought of that other person that seem to exist somewher in physic dark itself it seem to him that what he now saw by daylight wa a phantom of someon whom the night sister had murder and which now move purposeless about the scene of old peac rob even of the power of lament,faulkner
10721,10722,of cours the first furi of the second phase could not last,at first it had been a torrent now it wa a tide with a flow and ebb,faulkner
10723,10724,dure it flood she could almost fool them both,it wa as if out of her knowledg that it wa just a flow that must present react wa born a wilder furi a fierc denial that could flag itself and him into physic experiment that transcend imagin carri them as though by momentum alon bear them without volit or plan,faulkner
10725,10726,it wa as if she knew somehow that time wa short that autumn wa almost upon her without know yet the exact signific of autumn,it seem to be instinct alon instinct physic and instinct denial of the wast year,faulkner
10727,10728,then the tide would ebb,then they would be strand as behind a die mistral upon a spent and satiat beach look at one anoth like stranger with hopeless and reproach on hi part with weari on her with despair eye,faulkner
10729,10730,but the shadow of autumn wa upon her,she began to talk about a child as though instinct had warn her that now wa the time when she must either justifi or expiat,faulkner
10731,10732,she talk about it in the ebb period,at first the begin of the night wa alway a flood as if the hour of light and of separ had damn up enough of the wast stream to simul torrent for a moment at least,faulkner
10733,10734,but after a while the stream becam too thin for that he would go to her now with reluct a stranger alreadi backlook a stranger he would leav her after have sat with her in the dark bedroom talk of still a third stranger,he notic now how as though by premedit they met alway in the bedroom as though they were marri,faulkner
10735,10736,no more did he have to seek her through the hous the night when he must seek her hidden and pant and nake about the dark hous or among the shrubberi of the ruin park were as dead now as the hollow fencepost below the barn,that wa all dead the scene the faultlessli play scene of secret and monstrou delight and of jealousi,faulkner
10737,10738,though if she had but known it now she had reason for jealousi,he made trip everi week or so on busi he told her,faulkner
10739,10740,she did not know that the busi took him to memphi where he betray her with other women women bought for a price,she did not know it,faulkner
10741,10742,perhap in the phase in which she now wa she could not have been convinc would not have listen to proof would not have care,becaus she had taken to lie sleepless most of the night make up the sleep in the afternoon,faulkner
10743,10744,she wa not sick it wa not her bodi,she had never been better her appetit wa enorm and she weigh thirti pound more than she had ever weigh in her life,faulkner
10745,10746,it wa not that that kept her awak,it wa someth out of the dark the earth the die summer itself someth threat and terribl to her becaus instinct assur her that it would not harm her that it would overtak and betray her complet but she would not be harm that on the contrari she would be save that life would go on the same and even better even less terribl,faulkner
10747,10748,what wa terribl wa that she did not want to be save,i m not readi to pray yet she said aloud quietli rigid soundless her eye wide open while the moon pour and pour into the window fill the room with someth cold and irrevoc and wild with regret,faulkner
10749,10750,don t make me have to pray yet,dear god let me be damn a littl longer a littl while she seem to see her whole past life the starv year like a gray tunnel at the far and irrevoc end of which as unfad as a reproach her nake breast of three short year ago ach as though in agoni virgin and crucifi not yet dear god,faulkner
10751,10752,she talk about it imperson at first discuss children,perhap it wa sheer and instinct feminin cun and indirect perhap not,faulkner
10753,10754,anyway it wa some time befor he discov with a kind of shock that she wa discuss it as a possibl a practic thought,he said no at onc,faulkner
10755,10756,whi not she said,she look at him specul,faulkner
10757,10758,he wa think fast think she want to be marri,that s it,faulkner
10759,10760,she want a child no more than i do,it s just a trick he thought,faulkner
10761,10762,i should have known it expect it,i should have clear out of here a year ago but he wa afraid to tell her thi to let the word marriag come between them come aloud think she may not have thought of it and i will just put the notion in her head she wa watch him,faulkner
10763,10764,whi not she said,and then someth in him flash whi not,faulkner
10765,10766,it would mean eas secur for the rest of your life,you would never have to move again,faulkner
10767,10768,and you might as well be marri to her as thi think no,that wa in septemb,faulkner
10769,10770,just after christma she told him that she wa pregnant,almost befor she ceas to speak he believ that she wa lie,faulkner
10771,10772,he discov now that he had been expect her to tell him that for three month,but when he look at her face he knew that she wa not,faulkner

10779,10780,i would like to see father s and calvin s face,thi will be a good time for you to run if that s what you want to do but it wa as though she were not listen to her own voic did not intend for the word to have ani actual mean that final upflar of stubborn and die summer upon which autumn the dawn of halfdeath had come unawar,faulkner
10781,10782,it s over now she thought quietli finished except the wait for one month more to pass to be sure she had learn that from the negro women that you could not alway tell until after two month,she would have to wait anoth month watch the calendar,faulkner
10783,10784,she made a mark on the calendar to be sure so there would be no mistak through the bedroom window she watch that month accomplish,a frost had come and some of the leav were begin to turn,faulkner
10785,10786,the mark day on the calendar came and pass she gave herself anoth week to be doubli sure,she wa not elat sinc she wa not surpris,faulkner
10787,10788,i am with child she said quietli aloud,i ll go tomorrow he told himself that same day,faulkner

10797,10798,might as well have all the jack i can get he thought,if she ain t anxiou for me to clear out no reason whi i should be,faulkner
10799,10800,the weather remain cold bright and cold,when he went to bed now in hi cotton blanket in the draughti cabin he would think of the bedroom in the hous with it fire it ampl quilt lintpad cover,faulkner

10803,10804,so might he have bought one,but he did not,faulkner
10805,10806,neither did she,he wait,faulkner
10807,10808,he wait what he thought wa a long time,then one even in februari he return home and found a note from her on hi cot,faulkner

10821,10822,she did not even turn her head when he enter,bring that chair up with you she said,faulkner
10823,10824,thi wa how the third phase began,it puzzl him for a while even more than the other two,faulkner
10825,10826,he had expect eager a kind of tacit apolog or lack that an acquiesc that want onli to be woo,he wa prepar to go that length even,faulkner
10827,10828,what he found wa a stranger who put asid with the calm firm of a man hi hand when at last and in a kind of baffl desper he went and touch her,come on he said if you have someth to tell me,faulkner
10829,10830,we alway talk better afterward,do you realis she said that you are wast your life and he sat look at her like a stone as if he could not believ hi own ear,faulkner
10831,10832,it took him some time to comprehend what she meant,she did not look at him at all,faulkner
10833,10834,she sat look into the fire her face cold still brood talk to him as if he were a stranger while he listen in outrag amaz,she want him to take over all her busi correspond and the period the negro school,faulkner
10835,10836,she had the plan all elabor,she recit it to him in detail while he listen in mount rage and amaz,faulkner
10837,10838,he wa to have complet charg and she would be hi secretari assist they would travel to the school togeth visit in the negro home togeth listen even with hi anger he knew that the plan wa mad,and all the while her calm profil in the peac firelight wa as grave and tranquil as a portrait in a frame,faulkner
10839,10840,when he left he rememb that she had not onc mention the expect child,he did not yet believ that she wa mad,faulkner
10841,10842,he thought that it wa becaus she wa pregnant as he believ that wa whi she would not let him touch her,he tri to argu with her,faulkner
10843,10844,but it wa like tri to argu with a tree she did not even rous herself to deni she just listen quietli and then talk again in that level cold tone as if he had never spoken,when he rose at last and went out he did not even know if she wa awar that he had gone,faulkner
10845,10846,he saw her but onc more within the next two month,he follow hi daili routin save that he did not approach the hous at all now take hi meal downtown again as when he had first gone to work at the mill,faulkner
10847,10848,but then when he first went to work he would not need to think of her dure the day he hardli ever thought about her,now he could not help himself,faulkner
10849,10850,she wa in hi mind so constantli that it wa almost as if he were look at her there in the hous patient wait inescap crazi,dure the first phase it had been as though he were outsid a hous where snow wa on the ground tri to get into the hous dure the second phase he wa at the bottom of a pit in the hot wild dark now he wa in the middl of a plain where there wa no hous not even snow not even wind,faulkner
10851,10852,he began now to be afraid whose feel up to now had been bewilder and perhap forebod and fatal,he now had a partner in hi whiskey busi a stranger name brown who had appear at the mill one day earli in the spring seek work,faulkner
10853,10854,he knew that the man wa a fool but at first he thought at least he will have sens enough to do what i tell him to do,he won t have to think himself at all it wa not until later that he said to himself i know now that what make a fool is an inabl to take even hi own good advice he took brown becaus brown wa a stranger and had a certain cheer and unscrupul readi about him and not overmuch person courag know that in the hand of a judici man a coward within hi own limit can be made fairli use to anyon except himself,faulkner
10855,10856,hi fear wa that brown might learn about the woman in the hous and do someth irrevoc out of hi own unpredict folli,he wa afraid that the woman sinc he had avoid her might take it into her head to come to the cabin some night,faulkner
10857,10858,he had not seen her but onc sinc februari,that wa when he sought her to tell her that brown wa come to live with him in the cabin,faulkner
10859,10860,it wa on sunday,he call her and she came out to where he stood on the back porch and listen quietli,faulkner
10861,10862,you didn t have to do that she said,he didn t understand then what she meant,faulkner
10863,10864,it wa not until later that think again flash complet like a print sentenc she think that i brought him out here to keep her off,she believ that i think that with him there she won t dare come down to the cabin that she will have to let me alon,faulkner
10865,10866,thu he put hi belief hi fear of what she might do into hi own mind by believ that he had put it into her,he believ that sinc she had thought that that brown s presenc would not onli not deter her it would be an incent for her to come to the cabin,faulkner
10867,10868,becaus of the fact that for over a month now she had done noth at all made no move at all he believ that she might do anyth,now he too lay awak at night,faulkner
10869,10870,but he wa think i have got to do someth,he expect each time to find her wait,faulkner
10871,10872,when he would reach the cabin and find it empti he would think in a kind of impot rage of the urgenc the lie and the hast and of her alon and idl in the hous all day with noth to do save to decid whether to betray him at onc or tortur him a littl longer,by ordinari he would not have mind whether brown knew about their relat or not,faulkner
10873,10874,he had noth in hi natur of retic or of chivalri toward women,it wa practic materi,faulkner
10875,10876,he would have been indiffer if all jefferson knew he wa her lover it wa that he want no one to begin to specul on what hi privat life out there wa becaus of the hidden whiskey which wa net him thirti or fortydollar a week,that wa one reason,faulkner
10877,10878,anoth reason wa vaniti,he would have die or murder rather than have anyon anoth man learn what their relat had now becom,faulkner
10879,10880,that not onli had she chang her life complet but that she wa tri to chang hi too and make of him someth between a hermit and a missionari to negro,he believ that if brown learn the one he must inevit learn the other,faulkner
10881,10882,so he would reach the cabin at last after the lie and the hurri and as he put hi hand on the door rememb the hast and think that in a moment he would find that it had not been necessari at all and yet to neglect which precaut he dare not he would hate her with a fierc revuls of dread and impot rage,then one even he open the door and found the note on the cot,faulkner
10883,10884,he saw it as soon as he enter lie squar and white and profoundli inscrut against the dark blanket,he did even stop to think that he believ he knew what the messag would be would promis,faulkner
10885,10886,he felt no eager he felt relief,it s over now he thought not yet take up the fold paper,faulkner
10887,10888,it will be like it wa befor now,no more talk about nigger and babi,faulkner
10889,10890,she ha come around,she ha worn the other out seen that she wa get nowher,faulkner
10891,10892,she see now that what she want need is a man,she want a man by night what he doe by daylight doe not matter,faulkner
10893,10894,he should have realis then the reason whi he had not gone away,he should have seen that he wa bound just as tightli by that small squar of still undivulg paper as though it were a lock and chain,faulkner
10895,10896,he did not think of that,he saw onli himself onc again on the verg of promis and delight,faulkner
10897,10898,it would be quieter though now,they would both want it so besid the whiphand which he would now have,faulkner
10899,10900,all that foolish he thought hold the yet unopen paper in hi hand all that damn foolish,she is still she and i am still i and now after all thi damn foolish think how they would both laugh over it tonight later afterward when the time for quiet talk and quiet laugh came at the whole thing at one anoth at themselv,faulkner
10901,10902,he did not open the note at all,he put it away and wash and shave and chang hi cloth whistl while he did so,faulkner
10903,10904,he had not finish when brown came in,well well well brown said,faulkner
10905,10906,christma said noth,he wa face the shard of mirror nail to the wall knot hi tie,faulkner

16199,16200,he wa too but by ten oclock he knew the day would be bad or wors than the day befor,it wa as silli for him to think that he could trail with hi father as to think he could fight with him,hemingway
16201,16202,he knew too that it wa not just that they were men,they were profession hunter and he knew now that wa whi juma would not even wast a smile,hemingway
16203,16204,they knew everyth the eleph had done point out the sign of it to each other without speak and when the track becam difficult hi father alway yield to juma,when they stop to fill the water bottl at a stream hi father said just last the day out davey,hemingway
16205,16206,then when they were final past the broken countri and climb again toward the forest the track of the eleph turn off to the right onto an old eleph trail,he saw hi father and juma talk and when he got up to them juma wa look back over the way they had come and then at a far distant stoni island of hill in the dri countri and seem to be take a bear of thi against the peak of three far blue hill on the horizon,hemingway

16213,16214,the bird had come into the old eleph trail to dust walk neatli and plumpli and when the pebbl broke the back of one and the bird began to jerk and toss with it wing thump anoth bird ran forward to peck at it and david pouch anoth pebbl and pull it back and sent it against the rib of the second bird,as he ran forward to put hi hand on it the other bird whir off,hemingway
16215,16216,juma had look back and smile thi time and david pick up the two bird warm and plump and smoothli feather and knock their head against the handl of hi hunt knife,now where they were camp for the night hi father said i ve never seen that type of francolin quit so high,hemingway
16217,16218,you did veri well to get a doubl on them,juma cook the bird spit on a stick over the coal of a veri small fire,hemingway
16219,16220,hi father drank a whiskey and water from the cup top of hi flask as they lay and watch juma cook afterward juma gave them each a breast with the heart in it and ate the two neck and back and the leg himself,it make a great differ davey hi father said,hemingway
16221,16222,we re veri well off on ration now,how far are we behind him,hemingway
16223,16224,david ask,we re quit close actual hi father said,hemingway
16225,16226,it all depend on whether he travel when the moon come up,it s an hour later tonight and two hour later than when you found him,hemingway
16227,16228,whi doe juma think he know where he s go,he wound him and kill hi askari not too far from here,hemingway
16229,16230,when,five year ago he say,hemingway
16231,16232,that may mean anytim,when you were still a tow he say,hemingway
16233,16234,ha he been alon sinc then,he say so,hemingway
16235,16236,he ha nt seen him,onli heard of him,hemingway
16237,16238,how big doe he say he is,close to two hundr,hemingway
16239,16240,bigger than anyth i ve ever seen,he say there s onli been one greater eleph and he came from near here too,hemingway

16245,16246,so wa juma,in the night when he woke after the moon wa up he wa sure they were not proud of him except perhap for hi dexter in kill the two bird,hemingway
16247,16248,he had found the eleph at night and follow him to see that he had both of hi tusk and then return to find the two men and put them on the trail,david knew they were proud of that,hemingway
16249,16250,but onc the deadli follow start he wa useless to them and a danger to their success just as kibo had been to him when he had gone up close to the eleph in the night and he knew they must each have hate themselv for not have sent him back when there wa time,the tusk of the eleph weigh two hundr pound apiec,hemingway
16251,16252,ever sinc these tusk had grown beyond their normal size the eleph had been hunt for them and now the three of them would kill him,david wa sure that they would kill him now becaus he david had last through the day and kept up after the pace had destroy him by noon,hemingway
16253,16254,so they probabl were proud of him do that,but he had brought noth use to the hunt and they would have been far better off without him,hemingway
16255,16256,mani time dure the day he had wish that he had never betray the eleph and in the afternoon he rememb wish that he had never seen him,awak in the moonlight he knew that wa not true,hemingway

16259,16260,the detail of the countri were sharp and clear as the morn until the foreshorten and prolong of exhaust and he had written that well,but hi feel about the eleph had been the hardest part and he knew he would have to get away from it and then come back to it to be certain it wa as it had been not later but on that day,hemingway
16261,16262,he knew the feel had begun to form but he had been too exhaust to rememb it exactli,still involv in thi problem and live in the stori he lock up hi suitcas and came out of the room onto the hagston that led down to the terrac where marita wa sit in a chair under one of the pine face out toward the sea,hemingway

24591,24592,i gave my tefillin away,back when my father wa an overwork insur man be a jew for him hadn t had much to do with formal worship and like most of the firstgener american father in our neighborhood he visit the nearbi synagogu onli on the high holiday and when it wa necessari as a mourner,roth
24593,24594,and at home there were realli no ritual he observ,sinc hi retir howev and particularli in the last decad of my mother s life they had begun to attend servic togeth mostli everi friday night and though he still didn t go so far as to lay tefillin in the morn hi judaism wa more pointedli focus on the synagogu and the servic and the rabbi than it had been at ani time sinc hi childhood,roth
24595,24596,the templ wa a hundr or so yard down the road on a littl side street off north broad in an old hous that wa rent by the small congreg of elderli local peopl who were bare abl to meet the upkeep cost,to my perhap becaus they couldn t afford anyon cantor wasn t even a jew but a bulgarian who work for a new york auction hous dure the week and for thi littl conclav of elizabeth jew on their sabbath,roth
24597,24598,after the servic wa over he sometim entertain them with song from yentl and fiddler on the roof,my father love the bulgarian s deep voic and consid him a buddi he also thought highli of the yeshiva student who came over from new york to lead their servic on the weekend a twentythreeyearold whom my father call rabbi most respect and spoke of as someth of a sage,roth
24599,24600,howev humbl their manifest these yearn for a formal religion in hi old age were inspir by someth far from hypocrisi or convent decorum in fact the consol that he seem to deriv from go to synagogu sens of uniti it bestow on hi long life and the communion with hi own mother and father he told me he felt hi get rid of the tefillin one of the more enigmat instanc of hi lifelong habit of relinquish rather than save the treasur object of the past,given the link of sentiment that jewish belief now seem to furnish between the isol of old age and the strive popul life that wa all but gone i could have imagin him instead of part with hi tefillin rediscov in the mere contempl of them someth of their ancient fetishist power,roth
24601,24602,but my imagin thi old man medit fondl hi longneglect tefillin wa so much sentiment kitsch realli a scene out of some jewish parodi of wild strawberri,how my father actual dispos of the tefillin reveal an imagin altogeth bolder and more mysteri inspir by a person symbol mytholog as eccentr as beckett s or gogol s,roth
24603,24604,who d you give the tefillin to i ask him,who,roth

24609,24610,i m curiou i final said,how come you didn t go to the rabbi,roth
24611,24612,or wa i wrong about that too,mayb he d never even thought of the rabbi as perhap the shrug wa meant to it wa just reveal to him in a flash the knowledg that in that secret place where jewish men stood unashamedli nake befor one anoth he could lay hi tefillin to rest without worri the understand that where hi tefillin would come to no harm where they would not be profan or desecr where they might even be resanctifi wa in the midst of those familiar jewish belli and ball,roth
24613,24614,perhap what the act signifi wa not hi shame befor the young rabbiintrain but a declar that the men s locker room at the local ymha wa closer to the core of the judaism he live by than the rabbi s studi at the noth would have been more artifici than go with the tefillin to the rabbi even if the rabbi had been a hundr with a beard down to the ground,ye the locker room of the y where they undress they schvitz they stank where as men among men familiar with everi nook and cranni of their worndown old illshapen bodi they kibitz and told their dirti joke and where onc upon a time they d made their wa their templ and where they remain jew,roth
24615,24616,i didn t ask whi he hadn t turn them over to me,i didn t ask whi instead of give back to me all those napkin and tablecloth and place mat he hadn t given me the tefillin instead,roth
24617,24618,i wouldn t have pray with them but i might well have cherish them especi after hi death,but how wa he to know that,roth
24619,24620,he probabl thought i would have scof at the veri idea of hi hand on hi tefillin to and forti year earlier he would have been right,i didn t ask becaus i realiz that to do so wa truli to place the two of us back insid that corni scenario i couldn t seem to cut myself loos from,roth
24621,24622,somewhat improb where hi tefillin were concern it wa i whose imagin kept run to the predict maudlin while hi had the integr of a genuin anomal talent compel by the element feel that can lend ritualist intens to even the goofiest act,well i said when it wa clear that he had no more to tell me one of your pal there must have got a big surpris when he came up from the pool,roth

24981,24982,i feel like forti wa someth he d told everyon even on day when it wasn t true until just a few month back,benjamin stuck the mri pictur of the brain up on the light screen behind hi desk and told me to come around and take a look at them with him,roth
24983,24984,my father sat docil besid lil hold in hi hand hi piec of paper with the list of question while the doctor speak so softli that onli i could hear trace a finger over the pictur to show me the extens of the tumor,strictli speak he said it wasn t a brain tumor,roth
24985,24986,probabl it had begun as a tumor on a facial nerv and grown to where now it wa not onli push against the brain stem but extrud through the bone at the back of the nose,meyerson had estim that it would take eight to ten hour to oper and had call the oper routin,roth
24987,24988,now i wa told that it would more like take thirteen or fourteen hour and that the oper involv work where all the arteri and nerv are mass tricki terrain the doctor said,are you tell me it s imposs i ask him,roth
24989,24990,not at all he snap back as though i had impugn hi expertis,hi brotherinlaw had a tumor like thi and they radiat it,roth
24991,24992,use radiat and it went away,i m not say that would solv everyth be perman,roth
24993,24994,roth he repli veri gentli i don t know if radiat would be effect until i know the kind of tumor we re deal with,to know that i need in addit to these pictur a cat scan to give us a pictur of the skull as well as the situat with the brain,roth
24995,24996,i then need a biopsi of the tumor,the biopsi is done with a needl the doctor told him,roth
24997,24998,it s a procedur that take no more than an hour,i would recommend that you come into the hospit overnight so that we can watch you afterward,roth
24999,25000,my father s unembellish style and the fight that wa obvious still in him despit hi age and all he wa up against seem somewhat to beguil the sophist neurosurgeon and even to touch some chord of person sympathi,sever time in recount the histori of hi ill my father had veer off into an anecdot out of hi newark childhood some seventyf year earlier a narr whose subterranean messag appear to be that he had learn to be realist on rutger street and wa prepar for whatev befel him now,roth

25007,25008,my father wa obvious come to trust and even to imbu with a certain divin might thi doctor who wa at onc so much more patrician and potentlook than haimish heavyset dr,meyerson who had propos to do rather more than stick a needl up through the roof of hi mouth,roth
25009,25010,it occur to me that if we were all to sit and talk togeth in benjamin s offic for anoth day or two my father would eventu overcom hi fear of call down even wors miseri upon himself by appear sin greedi and proclaim to thi doctor what had to be in hi heart which wa that he want not just three or four year more but to tackl the whole damn thing all over again i rais myself up out of the immigr street without even a high school educ i never knuckl under never broke the law never lost my courag or said i quit i wa a faith husband a loyal american a proud jew i gave two wonder boy everi opportun i myself never had and what i am demand is onli what i eightysix year,whi he would ask him should a man die at all and of cours he would have been right to ask,roth

32939,32940,the next move is up to copenhagen,what are we ask of copenhagen,roth
32941,32942,what are we ask of copenhagen,who is curt flood,roth
32943,32944,flood wa a basebal player for the st,then tragedi struck,roth
32945,32946,to my dear parent,to my loyal and devot brother,roth
32947,32948,toni,abe forta and mr,roth
32949,32950,goldbarg,abe forta join forc with mr,roth
32951,32952,now you may say to me but sure mr,through jitsp,roth
32953,32954,so i am afraid the,who then you ask did he seek to corrupt,roth
32955,32956,i am sure you all know by now the natur of the chant and the song that these ten thousand boy scout were sing in the street of the nation s capit,i am sure you are familiar with the kind of placard they were wave befor the televis camera,roth
32957,32958,i do not intend to repeat to you the word of those poster,it should suffic to say that they did justic to the languag and interest of charl curti flood whose favorit citi accord to hi own write is copenhagen denmark the pornographi capit of the world,roth
32959,32960,the poster are present in the hand of the fbi whose laboratori have alreadi begun the painstak job of fingerprint each and everi poster and submit them to blood test so as to determin the correl between the obscen print on an individu poster and the blood type of the boy scout bear the poster contain those objection word,if such correl can be establish with a reason degre of accuracyand we think they canit will of cours be of great assist to our law enforc agenc,roth
32961,32962,as you all know from the headlin of the approxim ten thousand boy scout who assembl here in washington dure the twoday upris to threaten the live of our brave fight men it wa necessari to kill onli three in order to maintain law and order,that break down to one and onehalf scout dead per diem while nine thousand nine hundr and ninetyeight and a half scout continu to live full and activ live the first day and nine thousand nine hundr and ninetyseven the second,roth
32963,32964,now i would think that by anyon s standard a mortal rate in a crisi of thi kind of is a wonder tribut to the veri great restraint with which we were abl to confront what could have been a terribl tragedi for our soldier,certainli it should give solac to all of those who detest bloodsh as much as i do and put the lie onc and for all to the viciou charg that it wa the militari and not the scout who were respons for the violenc,roth
32965,32966,of cours i am sure the great major of american realiz that there is alway go to be a small vocal minor of cavil and critic who are never go to be satisfi no matter how perfectli balanc the restraint and the firm with which we deal with civil disrupt of thi kind,even if there should be onli one person dead over a twoday period or as littl as half a person a day even if over a twoday period there should be onli one person who is slightli maimedthes critic will begin to talk as though the tragedi wa nt the overwhelm danger to which ten of thousand of our brave soldier were subject but the maim of one person out of onli ten thousand and what is more than like an outoftown who unlik our brave soldier had onli to remain at home to stay out of harm s way,roth
32967,32968,well to thi small vocal minor let me make one thing veri clear,i too have great sympathi for the famili of the three boy scout who were kill here in washington,roth
32969,32970,i am a father and i know full well how import children can be to a man s career and incident in that connect a wife,i am proud to say that my wife and my daughter were prepar to work far into the night in order that famili less fortun than our own might have some small comfort in their hour of need,roth
32971,32972,nor do we intend to forget these peopl when christma time roll around,but let there be no mistak about it quick on the trigger as i may be with compass for the innoc famili i am equal swift in my condemn of these three guilti scout,roth
32973,32974,and i say guilti becaus if they were not guilti they would not be dead,that is not the kind of countri we live in,roth
32975,32976,now i know there are those apologist for the boy scout upris who have attempt to arous sympathi for the three guilti scout by point out that while one had attain the rank of eagl scout the other two were onli tenderfoot,but what of the two tenderfoot they ask,roth
32977,32978,how could two littl tenderfoot pose so seriou a threat to our nation secur as to make it necessari to kill them,well let me answer that question my fellow american by show you the weapon that were found conceal hang from the belt of these two littl tenderfoot scout when their bodi were search by the fbi the secret servic the cia the militari polic the shore patrol the attorney gener s offic the capitol polic forc the polic forc of the district of columbia as well as by law enforc offic summon from around the countri to guarante the probiti and thorough of thi investig,roth
32979,32980,now i am sure that we all still rememb with a sad and mourn heart the italian carbin rifl purchas for from a chicago mailord hous by presid charisma s assassin lee harvey oswald whom i mention earlier in connect with jame earl ray and charl curti flood,in the mailord catalog that rifl probabl did not appear to be ani more sophist than the weapon i am about to show you now or ani more capabl of chang the cours of histori,roth
32981,32982,but let there be no mistak about it it is just as effect if not more so,firstli wherea the rifl that destroy presid charisma s polit career measur forti inch overal thi knife that i hold here in my hand measur with the blade sheath onli four and fiveeighth inch,roth
32983,32984,thi make it an ideal weapon to use in public place as oppos to a fortyinch rifl which might arous suspicion on a school bu or in a supermarket or ani of the hundr place where you and your love one find yourselv in the cours of an ordinari day,secondli it is a far more viciou weapon than an ordinari rifl and needless to say doe not even begin to approach in human a simpl thousandpound bomb let alon a nuclear ex plosiv,roth
32985,32986,as one who wa rais as a quaker you know i have a particularli strong interest in be human,that is whi sinc come to offic i have done everyth i can to get congress to appropri money for a weapon system that would make us number one in the world in that depart,roth
32987,32988,now that is the type of death peopl have dream about for themselv sinc time immemori and let it not be record that trick e dixon lack the moral and spiritu ideal to address himself to that dream,but now let me ask you thi my fellow american,roth
32989,32990,what could be further from the kind of painless death for men everywher that thi administr is work so hard to bring about than that which is experienc by the victim of a knife such as i am hold in my hand,not onli is it necessari to deliv as mani as five to ten horrifyingli pain stab wound in order to kill somebodi with a weapon thi small but in order to accomplish thi the murder must exhibit a sustain vicious a coldblood determin to kill that i assur you would shock and appal a combattri bomber pilot no less than it doe you and me,roth
32991,32992,whi els would they use a weapon that take up to half an hour to do the sort of job our pilot accomplish in a split second and without the groan and the gore,now let s look at the knife close,roth
32993,32994,am go to open out the blade one by one and describ to you the purpos and function of each,you should not be misl by it fourandfiveeighthsinch exterior into imagin that it is simpli an instrument design to kill,roth
32995,32996,like so mani of the weapon carri by guerrilla revolutionari around the world it ha multipl use of which murder of the agon and sadist varieti is but one,let s begin here with the smallest of the four blade,roth
32997,32998,in the languag of those who employ such weapon it is known as the bottl open,i ll tell you how it got that name in a moment,roth
32999,33000,you will observ that it is hookshap at the end and measur one inch and oneeighth,it is employ dure the interrog of prison primarili to goug out one or both of the eye,roth
33001,33002,last but not least it is sometim insert into the mouth of a prison who will not talk in order to slit the flesh at the upper part of the larynx between the vocal cord,that open up there is call the glotti and bottl open is deriv from glottal open the pet name origin attach to the blade by it most coldblood practition,roth
33003,33004,thi second largest blade measur one inch and threequart taper to a point and probabl look to you to be a miniatur bayonet,do not be fool by appear,roth
33005,33006,it ha noth to do with bayonet such as those our brave soldier found it necessari to fix to their rifl in selfdefens dure the twoday boy scout upris,thi littl blade is known as the leather punch and far from be an instrument of selfdefens it is yet anoth tortur devic along the line of the bottl open,roth
33007,33008,as it name suggest it is use to punch hole in human flesh or leather as the flesh is call by revolutionari who consid their enemi to be no more than anim,it will come as no surpris to you to learn that it is most frequent driven into the palm of the hand much the same way that the nail were in the movi the greatest stori ever told,roth
33009,33010,it is known as the screwdriv,tradit it is insert into the groov between the nail and the flesh and turn in a rotari fashion like so,roth
33011,33012,howev we know from intellig report that the screwdriv may also on occas be introduc into bodili apertur of which the nostril and the ear are the onli one i shall choos to make mention of on nationwid televis,some of my polit oppon may think otherwiseand they have everi right to disagre with my positionbut i for one have never believ it necessari to use bad languag to make my point and i have no intent of resort to those kind of tactic in the midst of a major address to the nation,roth
33013,33014,thi last blade of the four is probabl the one you re most familiar with from your nightmar,two inch and threequart in length ninesixteenth of an inch at it widest point it ha a sharp cut edg that i shall demonstr for you on thi piec of paper,roth
33015,33016,incident it is no accid that print on thi piec of paper is the preambl to the constitut the bill of right and the oftquot and much belov ten command with their famou thou shalt not,i do nt think i am too far afield when i say that what you see print on thi sheet of paper closeup of paper is just about everyth we believ in and cherish as a peopl,roth
33017,33018,i want you to watch as i demonstr what thi blade can do in a matter of second to all that you and i hold near and dear,he slice the piec of paper into oneinch strip and then hold them up for the audienc to see of cours you can peel appl with a blade like thi you can slice your potato for fri and you can cut up your cucumb radish tomato onion and celeri for salad,roth
33019,33020,and i am sure that those who would seek to exoner these three scout will maintain that it wa onli to prepar a delici salad such as i describ that they secret these weapon upon their belt and carri them hundr of mile across state line to the nation s capit,i am afraid that whether it is knifecarri boy scout or cardcarri communist there will alway be a hand of apologist around to come to their defens,roth
33021,33022,my fellow american i want to leav it to you and not to the apologist to decid,i ask you to look at thi fourprong instrument of tortur,roth
33023,33024,i ask you to look at what just one of those blade wa abl to do to the preambl to the constitut the bill of right and the belov ten command,and now i ask you if you think there is anyth at all to be said in defens of three boy scout carri such knive into the nation s capit,roth
33025,33026,and incident in that connect these were not the onli three boy scout in washington bear conceal weapon on their belt,these were onli the three we happen to kill,roth
33027,33028,in all a total of eight thousand four hundr and sixtythre knive each resembl thi one in everi last detail were confisc dure the two day the scout were here,that mean a grand total of thirtythre thousand eight hundr and fiftytwo blade or enough blade to tortur simultan everi singl resid of chevi chase maryland includ women and children,roth
33029,33030,now you ask how did we prevent thi bloodbath from take place in chevi chase,the answer is by set up an enclos camp site for the scout who were not shot,roth
33031,33032,and let me tell you someth it is to the veri great credit of the scout movement in thi countri that onc we were abl to get these boy off the street and into a rug camp situationand we have the polic to thank for volunt their help in get all the boy out therethey show themselv worthi in everi way of their famou motto be prepar,let s take a look at just a few of their accomplish first in the absenc of toilet facil they did a tremend job in dispos of their wast matter and the leav they use for person hygien,roth
33033,33034,next what littl water they had in their canteen they share in an admir way or so it would seem from the fact that not a singl one of the nearli ten thousand die of thirst,nor did they make the mistak of drink from or even dare to bath in the pond at the campsit,roth
33035,33036,so familiar were they with the danger sign of sewag and stagnat,as for eat well i m proud to say that by morn they had discov edibl root and berri we did nt even know were there,roth
33037,33038,and as for warmth as you could expect they manag dure the night to start sever fire in the classic boy scout manner of rub two stick togeth,in all what might have been a nightmar for the citizen of chevi chase maryland wa convert into wonder scout experi for the boy themselv and one that i m sure they ll rememb for a long time to come,roth
33039,33040,i know that when the polic van return thi morn to take them away mani of the boy were reluct to leav the campsit,so anxiou were some to spend anoth night under the star and away from the socal comfort of civil such as medic attent lawyer telephon and food that it wa necessari for the polic to chase after them and liter drag them off the premis and into the wait truck,roth
33041,33042,with fewer and fewer opportun avail to our youth for rough it thi administr natur take pride in what we were abl to do for these youngster last night,now i know that mani of you out there across the countri are ask yourselv whi i should be make such a gener offer to the scout,roth
33043,33044,whi do i prais them for their behavior at the campsit,whi am i will to forgiv these youngster and give them anoth chanc to make a decent start in life,roth
33045,33046,it must seem to those of you who saw the scout wave their sign here in the street of the nation s capitalsign offens and insult not onli to me but what is far wors to my innoc familythat i more than anyon have a right to harbor a grievanc against these ten thousand boy scout and particularli against the three who are now dead and will never be abl to come to me like respons children and apolog for tri to smear my reput,whi you may ask am i so compassion judici charit toler and wise when it wa my veri own polit career that stood to be most damag by these sign,roth
33047,33048,well those are good and intellig question,let me tri to answer them as forthrightli as i know how,roth
33049,33050,oh sure somebodi els might tri to make polit capit out of a vendetta against these youngster call them hoodlum and bum and rotten appl but i am afraid i am just too big a man for that,as far as i am concern these boy have learn their lesson as they prove at the campsit and that goe for the three dead scout as well,roth
33051,33052,even if those three dead boy do nt come and apolog as far as i am concern the past is past and i for one am will to forgiv and forget,for make no mistak about it while it is true that i am strongli oppos to permiss i am just as oppos to vindict,roth
33053,33054,i no more believ in punish a wrongdoer to excess than i would subscrib to the liber philosophi that allow a crimin to go merrili on hi way after he ha commit a crime,but of even greater import i just do nt think we ever cure a diseas by treat one of it symptom,roth
33055,33056,rather we must get to the caus of the ill,and certainli you know as well as i do that the caus of america s problem is not the boy scout of america,roth
33057,33058,nobodi is ever go to believ that and that is whi i do nt even attempt to make a case for it,they are just anoth group of american youngster who have fallen prey to that small dedic band of malcont and revolutionari who are out to destroy our countri by destroy our most import natur resourc of all our wonder youth,roth
33059,33060,and unless we cut these sourc of contagion from our societi as swiftli and thoroughli as we would excis a cancer from a live bodyand i know we are all unit in our opposit to cancer democrat and republican alikethi diseas that ha spread even to the boy scout will grow in virul until it ha infect everi last child in the land includ your own,and so long as i am presid i am not go to stand idli by while the children of thi countri come down with cancer leukemia or incident in that connect muscular dystrophi,roth

33071,33072,on the contrari they have reject out of hand everi legitim request we have made of them,even now with the american armi mass on their border the american navi blockad their coast and the american marin firmli in control of hamlet s castl they continu to provid him with the same protect from the law that they provid to pornograph and filth peddler from around the globe,roth
33073,33074,i know that in the face of such profound contempt for american power and prestig the great major of american would agre that i have no choic but to order our troop onto danish soil so as to establish the dar,as the freeli elect govern in copenhagen,roth

33081,33082,not onli would they have to fli in at treetop level to avoid detect by the danish radar system but there wa no precis way of tell the exact size of the arsen that flood had manag to assembl with the approv if not the outright assist of the danish govern,would he resort to poison ga,roth
33083,33084,would he dare to employ tactic nuclear weapon,there wa no way in which our aerial photographi could penetr thi man s skull to see just how far he would go in violat the written and unwritten rule of warfar,roth
33085,33086,design to captur flood remov him by helicopt to elsinor and henc by militari jet to america the mission wa name by me oper courag and assign to joint conting task forc derringdo,it is with deep pride my fellow american that i can now tell you that oper courag ha been carri out to perfect exactli in accord with the meticul rehears schedul drawn up beforehand,roth
33087,33088,first off the danger flight from elsinor to the land site wa made in twentytwo minut and fourteen second precis accord to the plan,next the hazard search of the farmhous the outbuild and the till acreag wa accomplish in thirtyfour minut and eighteen second in other word with two full second to spare,roth
33089,33090,the ticklish evacu proceed requir precis the seven minut call for in the schedul and the dare return flight to elsinor at treetop level wa accomplish in twentytwo minut flat,moreov our forc return to safeti without sustain a singl casualti,roth
33091,33092,as at elsinor the enemi wa so complet taken by surpris that they did not fire a singl shot,i am proud to tell you that the intellig on oper courag wa equal as impress as the splitsecond time with which thi peril mission wa accomplish,roth
33093,33094,first the seven blondhair femal who were identifi on the aerial photo move in and out of the farmhous at all hour of the day were present at the time of the land,they were found as expect in bed scatter throughout the hous and taken immedi into custodi for interrog by the green beret as wa the coupl claim to be their father and mother,roth
33095,33096,the blondhair femal found in the bed in variou stage of undress rang in age from seven to eighteen,second the dark round object visibl in the aerial photograph and identifi posit by intellig as watermelon were no longer in the field or patch at the time of the land nor wa there evid ani longer of the watermelon vine themselv,roth
33097,33098,thi ha led intellig to conclud that onli hour befor the raid the telltal watermelon were remov and replac with the ordinari rock and potato plant found at the time of the land,as for the larg dark object identifi as charl curti flood himself appar at the veri last minut he too wa replac with a big black labrador dog,roth
33099,33100,thi wa verifi when the dog wa found romp in the veri field where photograph taken the previou night reveal the fugit exercis by moonlight,it is to the great credit of the command in charg of oper courageand repres the highest order of dedic and professionalismthat in order to keep faith to the plan the dog wa taken into custodi in precis the same amount of time as had been allot for the captur of flood,roth
33101,33102,she wa then transport in the command helicopt bound and under heavi guard to hamlet s castl at elsinor,howev onc the helicopt touch safe clown i immedi gave the order from the white hous that the interrog of the dog wa to be suspend and that she wa to be releas from her bind and allow to roam on a leash in a grassi enclosur on the castl ground,roth
33103,33104,now it had been my hope that i could come befor you tonight to tell you that flood wa in the custodi of american offici and that it would not be necessari to take further measur against a recalcitr and contemptu danish govern in order to secur hi releas,and make no mistak about it,roth
33105,33106,if we were not deal with a man so viciou that he would rather risk the life of an innoc femal dog than hi own i could have done just that,howev even though they were unabl to apprehend the fugit at thi time i should still like to take thi opportun to pay a tribut to the skill courag and devot with which joint conting task forc derringdo carri out oper courag,roth
33107,33108,the flawless fashion in which they execut thi delic secret mission wa inspir to all american,and sure it must be account the most success singl oper of it kind stage thu far in the danish crisi,roth
33109,33110,the embarrass alon that we have caus copenhagen by point up the hole in their radar system will inevit have a profound effect upon the moral of the danish peopl and their arm forc,ye they were written with a quill pen on a piec of parchment hundr and hundr of year ago but probabl never have they been so true as they are tonight,roth

33119,33120,trick e dixon is dead,that is all the inform we have at thi time,roth
33121,33122,the white hous ha refus to comment on an earlier bulletin announc that the presid of the unit state is dead,the white hous bilg secretari say there is no truth whatsoev to report of the presid s death but add that he will not categor deni the stori at thi time,roth
33123,33124,conflict stori continu to circul concern the death of the presid,a second white hous announc ha now call attent to the presid s schedul for the day point out that no mention is made there of die,roth
33125,33126,i think it would be best said the white hous bilg secretari in the light of these schedul to wait for a statement one way or anoth from the presid himself,report out of walter reed armi hospit now seem to confirm the earlier bulletin that the presid of the unit state is dead,roth
33127,33128,though the circumst surround hi death remain unclear it appear that the presid wa admit to walter reed late yesterday for surgeri,the purpos of the secret oper wa to remov the sweat gland from hi hip,roth
33129,33130,that is all we know at thi time,the vice presid ha flatli deni report of the presid s death,roth
33131,33132,here is a portion of the vice presid s remark made as he wa on hi way to address the nation yodel associ now thi is just the kind of reckless rot and rotten reckless that you can expect from the vile vilifi who are out to vilifi vile,what of the report mr,roth
33133,33134,vice presid that he had secretli enter walter reed last night to have the sweat gland remov from hi hip,hogwash and hokum,roth
33135,33136,and hooligan,and heinou,roth
33137,33138,i spoke to him onli five minut ago and found him fit as a fiddl,thi lachrymos lie is a lament lollapalooza launch by the lunat left,roth
33139,33140,unconfirm report from walter reed hospit now indic that the presid wa found dead at seven am,thi morn,roth
33141,33142,no word yet on the caus of death or where he wa found,specul mount that death came follow surgeri for the remov of sweat gland lodg in the hip,roth
33143,33144,then you are admit sir that he is dead,i did nt say that at all,roth
33145,33146,i said i just do nt think that hi death if it were to come about between now and the elect would affect hi popular with the great major of american,after all thi is nt the first time you peopl were readi to call him dead and here he is presid of the unit state,roth
33147,33148,but we meant dead polit,all i m say is that whether these rumor are true or fals is not go to affect our campaign plan by one iota,roth
33149,33150,i d even go so far as to say that if it turn out he actual is a corps our margin of victori in will be greater by far than what it wa in,how do you figur that mr,roth
33151,33152,chairman,well i for one just can not imagin the press of thi countri irrespons and viciou as it may be go after thi man dead and buri with the same kind of virul they use to go after him aliv,roth
33153,33154,furthermor as regard the voter themselv it would seem to me that there is a certain sympathi a certain warmth that a dead dixon is go to be abl to arous in the peopl of thi countri that he never realli wa abl to summon up when he wa live and breath and so on,if he is dead then you think it would be good for hi imag,roth
33155,33156,no doubt about it,i think that in term of exposur he may have gone about as far as he can aliv,roth
33157,33158,thi is probabl just the shot in the arm we ve been look for particularli if the democrat run teddi charisma,can you explain what you mean mr,roth
33159,33160,chairman,it s one thing you see for a candid for the presid to have two brother who are deadit s someth els when the incumb himself is dead,roth
33161,33162,i mean if experi is ani kind of criterionand i think it isi just do nt see how you can top the presid now where thi whole death issu is concern,mr,roth
33163,33164,chairman is there ani truth at all to the grow suspicion that you peopl are send up a trial balloon with these rumor of the presid s death,to see just how much polit mileag there is in it if ani,roth
33165,33166,that is on the one hand you yourself sound convinc that the presid s death would give a great boost to hi wane popular while vice presid whatshisnam assert that the presid is fit as a fiddl and that these rumor have been propag by the lunat left,look i have no intent of critic the alliter of the vice presid of the unit state of america,roth
33167,33168,under the constitut he ha a right to alliter just as much as ani other american citizen,i am speak to you boy strictli as parti chairman and all i am say in languag plain and simpl is that the presid ha absolut no intent of withdraw from the race for ani reason whatsoev includ hi own death,roth

33441,33442,but now he is gone and all at onc the veri deep affect the love if you will for their former neighbor is everywher appar,of cours you have to know new yorker to be abl to penetr the outer shell of cynic and see the love beneath,roth
33443,33444,you had to look but you saw it today here in new york in the seem boredom and indiffer of a bu driver in the impati of a salesgirl in the anger over noth of a taxi driver in the weari of the homebound worker pack into the subway in the blank gaze of the drunk along the boweri in the haughti of a dowag refus to curb her dog on the fashion upper east side,you had to look but there it wa love for trick e dixon,roth
33445,33446,ye the bitter ironi is thi he had to die in a baggi befor new yorker could tender him that hardwon love that would have meant so much to him,but then it is a day of bitter ironi,roth
33447,33448,ike iron from griefstricken and perhap guiltridden fifth avenu in the citi of new york where he live like a stranger but ha die like a longlost son,no the ordinari sign of grief are clearli not suffici to express the emot that they feel at thi hour and so they pretend for the time be that it simpli ha not happen or they giggl with embarrass and disbelief or they attempt to hide beneath a gruff exterior the deep love for a fallen leader that smolder away within,roth
33449,33450,and what of the madman who perpetr thi deed,for that stori we return you to the headquart of the fbi in washington,roth
33451,33452,that s right we re pretti sure now it wa a madman who perpetr thi deed,and the scout,roth
33453,33454,the knife,the louisvil slugger,roth
33455,33456,i m talk now about the brain behind the whole thing,more accur the lack of brain,roth
33457,33458,you see that s realli our number one clueeveryth els asid thi wa a pretti stupid thing to do to the presid,there he is the presid and they do a stupid thing like thi,roth
33459,33460,now if thi is somebodi s idea of a practic joke well i for one do nt consid it funni,you re not just stuf anybodi into a baggi you re stuf the presid of the unit state,roth
33461,33462,what about the digniti of hi offic,if you have no respect for the man what about the offic,roth
33463,33464,that s what realli gravel me person,i mean what do you think the enemi of democraci would think if they saw the presid of the unit state all curl up nake like that,roth
33465,33466,well i ll tell you what they d think they could nt be happier,do you think then that the assassin wa an enemi of democraci as well as a madman,roth
33467,33468,i do,and as i said a practic joker,roth
33469,33470,and even if we do nt find him we ve got the boy scout from boston who confess to thi thing in reserv so i d say on the whole we re in much better shape than we were last time and are realli just wait a goahead from the white hous,we are privileg to have with us in the studio one of the most distinguish member of the hous of repres a lead republican statesman and a friend and confid to the late presid,roth
33471,33472,congressman fraud thi is a sorrow day in our nation s histori,oh it s a day that will live in infami there s no doubt about that in my mind,roth
33473,33474,i am in fact introduc a bill into congress to have it declar a day that will live in infami and celebr as such in come year,what you ve got here as chief heehaw at the fbi wa say is a real lack of respect for the offic of the presid,roth
33475,33476,what you ve got here in thi assassin is a veri disrespect person and i would agre probabl a madman to boot,do you have ani idea congressman whi the white hous continu at thi late hour to refus to confirm the stori of the assassin,roth
33477,33478,i think it goe without say that we re in a sensit area here and consequ they want to move cautious on thi whole thing,i think they want first off to gaug the public reaction here at home and then of cours there is the reaction around the world to consid,roth
33479,33480,on the one hand you ve got our alli who depend upon us for support and on the other hand you ve got our enemi who are alway on the lookout for some chink in our armor and if you keep all that in mind then i think you have to agre that in the long run it is probabl in the interest of our integr and our credibl to cover thi whole thing up,i would think that some such reason as that is go on behind the scene at the white hous right now,roth
33481,33482,ha the first ladi been notifi,oh of cours,roth
33483,33484,what wa her reaction,well she wa understand quit overcom in the first moment,roth
33485,33486,consequ her immedi reaction wa to note that the manner in which the assassin went about the assassin wa in extrem bad tast,she said she just had to wonder about the upbring of a person who would forget someth like that,roth
33487,33488,she said she did nt want to blame the assassin s famili until she knew all the fact but it wa clear she felt there probabl could have been a wee bit more attent given to good groom in hi hous when the assassin wa grow up,what do you think of that idea,roth
33489,33490,not veri much,can you explain,roth
33491,33492,well it just doe nt make ani sens,now he did nt have to do that you knowbut he did becaus he want the peopl to have all the fact,roth
33493,33494,so i just do nt see how you can fault him there,no i just ca nt see where somebodi is go to assassin the presid for a sound polici decis such as thi one and that even goe for a madman,roth
33495,33496,no he had the mandat of the peopl here lunat includ,and the mandat of the congress as well,roth
33497,33498,in their behalf howev let me say that even they would not be so reckless as to assassin the presid becaus of a differ of opinion over some thing like bomb site,i mean nobodi s perfect,roth
33499,33500,and by and larg i think you can say that in the end the mistak in judgment and so on shake themselv out and we pretti much destroy the place that need destroy,it seem to me in fact that as regard the destruct of copenhagen you ll find that even among the presid s staunchest critic in the senat there wa a sens that a decis of that magnitud simpli could nt have been arriv at lightli or arbitrarili,roth
33501,33502,i think most of the truli respons member of the congress feel as i do that have made a strong show of strength such as thi in scandinavia now we are not go to get ourselv bog down there later the way we did in southeast asia,so you see no connect between the someth is rotten in denmark speech and the assassin,roth
33503,33504,no no,frankli i ca nt believ that the murder of the presid ha to do with anyth he ha ever said or done includ hi courag remark in behalf of the unborn and the sanctiti of human life,roth
33505,33506,no thi is one of those wild crazi act just as the fbi describ itth work of a madman and as the first ladi suggest a pretti illmann madman at that,it seem to me that ani attempt to find some ration polit motiv in anyth so bizarr and boorish as stuf the presid of the unit state uncloth into a waterfil baggi in the fetal posit is so much wast effort,roth
33507,33508,it s an act of violenc and disrespect utterli without rhyme or reason and can not but arous the righteou indign of reason and sensibl men everywher,by train they come by buss by car by plane by wheelchair by feet,roth
33509,33510,come some on cane and crutch and some on artifici limb,but come undaunt they do like pilgrim of yesteryear and yore to honor pay to him they love more than they knew,roth
33511,33512,reap by the grim reaper befor hi reap wa due he bring us togeth at last as he promis he one day would do,and do it he is,roth
33513,33514,it is i daresay a demonstr the like of which he who ha been grimli reap by the grim reaper did not ala surviv to wit,no dure hi brief resid on thi planet earth and hi three year in the white hous they demonstr not to honor him but to humili him not to pay him homag and respect but to shout their obscen at and display their disrespect toward him,roth
33515,33516,but these are not the obscenityshout and the disrespectdisplay gather here tonight along the bank of the potomacbank as old as the republ itselfand beneath the cherri blossom he so love and in the brood grandeur of thi the citi which embodi that which he who ha been untim reap would have himself willingli laid down hi life for had of him it been ask instead of cruelli be stolen in the night from him by an illmann madman with a baggi,yet madmen there have been and madmen there will be and still thi nation ha endur,roth

33599,33600,can you describ these peopl,are they the usual sort of demonstr you get here in washington,roth
33601,33602,oh no no,i would say they are actual bend over backward to cooper with the author,roth
33603,33604,so far at ani rate,what do you mean by so far,roth
33605,33606,well we have nt yet had to make ani arrest,we re under order from the white hous not to arrest anyon under ani condit,roth
33607,33608,as you can imagin thi is put someth of a strain on my men particularli as just about everybodi down here seem to have come for the purpos of get himself arrest,i mean i ve never seen anyth like it,roth
33609,33610,of cours none of it is worth the paper it s written on,some of it s kind of laughabl in fact it s so unprofession and obvious a slapdash lastminut job,roth
33611,33612,but still and all you got to give them credit for their fortitud,they grab hold of my men just like they had the good on themselv and actual tri to handcuff themselv to the offic with their own handcuff and get cart off to prison that way,roth
33613,33614,we ca nt park a squad car anywher without half a dozen of them jump into the back seat and scream take me to j edgar heehawand step on it,we re sort of humor them howev the best we can and the one who just wo nt quit we tell them to wait right where they are and we ll round them up later,roth
33615,33616,what we re hope for is a good thunderstorm dure the night that ll sort of break the back of the whole thing,mayb if they stand around long enough in the rain they ll get the idea that nobodi is go to arrest them no matter how much evid they produc and they ll go home,roth
33617,33618,but chief shackl suppos the rain doe nt comesuppos they are still jam the street in the morn,what about the worker tri to get to govern offices,roth
33619,33620,well they ll just have to suffer a littl inconveni i m afraid,becaus i am not subject my men to the charg of fals arrest just so somebodi can get to hi offic in time for the morn coffe break,roth
33621,33622,and then there are these order from the white hous,your assumpt then is that all these peopl here are innoc each and everi one,roth
33623,33624,absolut,if they were guilti they would be resist arrest,roth
33625,33626,they would be run away and so on,they would be scream about their lawyer and their right,roth
33627,33628,i mean that s how you can tell they re guilti in the first place,but all these peopl are say is i did it take me in,roth
33629,33630,thi is brad batho,violenc ha erupt here on pennsylvania avenu directli outsid the white hous gate where upward of thirti thousand mourner have alreadi gather to bid farewel to a fallen leader,roth
33631,33632,even as polic chief shackl wa prais thi crowd for their obedi to author and respect for the law a freeforal broke out among a group of fifteen men in busi suit,though polic intervent wa necessari no arrest were made,roth
33633,33634,i have here besid me one of the gentlemen who wa involv in the violent episod and by all appear he is still rather upset,sir how did the violenc begin,roth

33637,33638,well if it wa nt for the offic i m not kid somebodi might have gotten hurt,it could have been aw,roth
33639,33640,so you have noth but prais for the polic,well yesup to a point,roth
33641,33642,i mean he broke thi thing up onetwothre but then when it wa all over he still would nt make ani arrest,in fact onc he d separ us he just disappear like the lone ranger use to,roth
33643,33644,i ca nt find him anywher,some of the other guy want to find him too,roth
33645,33646,see we gave him these confess and all thi incrimin evid and so onand you know what he did with it,he just tore it up even while he wa run away,roth
33647,33648,fortun i had my secretari xerox all thi stuff at my offic so i ve got a copi at home but a lot of these guy were foolish enough to give him the onli copi of their confess that they had,about the onli good thing to come out of thi is the possibl that becaus the fifteen of us were seen all huddl togeth on the pavement here pound each other s head in we might get pick up as a conspiraci,roth
33649,33650,but go tri to find even a plainclothesman when you need one,hey you re not author to make an arrest are you by your network or someth,roth

33797,33798,they say of an ordinari man when and if he die that the loss is incalcul to the nation and the world,they say of an ordinari man when and if he die that all will be better for hi have pass their way,roth
33799,33800,need i go ani further,there wa an articl in a current magazin last month by a professor who is an author on human behavior and he write that you can tell when a crowd of peopl is in agreement with you,roth
33801,33802,well the professor is correct,becaus i know that you are all say to yourselv whi billi you re rightin vain do i listen for the word or word that describ he who lie here in thi baggi for these are phrase that summon up the imag of an ordinari leader not the extraordinari leader we have lost,roth
33803,33804,what word or word then will describ thi extraordinari man,i wa in an african countri one year ago thi juli and i heard a top polit expert there call him the presid of the unit state,roth
33805,33806,the presid of the unit state,the leader of the free world,roth

33809,33810,chief of the arm forc,yet are these the word in which he live in the heart of hi fellow countrymen,roth
33811,33812,perhap that is what he wa to the rest of the world,but to we who knew him noth so majest or formal could begin to commun the kind of man he wa and the esteem in which he wa held,roth
33813,33814,becaus to us he wa not a leader in the ordinari senseh wa a leader in the extraordinari sens,i m go to ask that we bow our head again,roth
33815,33816,and how appropri that it is a name even a puppi could bear for we all rememb as much as anyth about him the deep rever he had for dog,the name wa a simpl one my friend,roth
33817,33818,the name wa tricki,ye to you to me and to all american for gener to come tricki he wa and tricki he shall be,roth
33819,33820,and now all head bow and everi eye close let us pray,oh god who alon art ever merci in spare of punish humbl we pray thee on behalf of thi servant a man call tricki,roth
33821,33822,for let there be no mistak about it we are engag in a deadli competit with the kingdom of righteous,i could not agre more with satan when he say that our goal is not just to keep wicked for ourselv but to extend it to all creation becaus that is hell s destini,roth
33823,33824,to extend it to all creation becaus the aim of the righteou is not just to hold their own but to extend righteous,but we can not be victori over righteous with a strategi of simpli hold the line,roth
33825,33826,my disagr with satan then is not about the goal for hell but about the mean to reach those goal,now satan ha said that we are ahead in thi competit with righteous,roth
33827,33828,i can not agre with that apprais of the situat,as i look at hell today i believ that we are follow program of an outdat leadership,roth
33829,33830,i believ we are follow program mani of which have not work in the past and will not work in the futur,i say that the program and leadership that have fail under satan s administr are not the program and the leadership that hell need now,roth
33831,33832,i say that the damn and the doom do not want to go back to the polici of the garden of eden,i say that the son and daughter of disobedi deserv a devil of consumm deprav a devil who will devot himself not to old and wornout iniqu but to bold new program in evil that will overturn god s kingdom and plung men into etern death,roth
33833,33834,what we need down here is not just high hope,what we need is crafti wile and untir zeal,roth
33835,33836,in the field of execut leadership i believ it is essenti that the devil not onli set the tone but he also must lead he must act as he talk,frankli i do nt think thi is the kind of leadership we have been get,roth
33837,33838,now sinc my arriv i have travel to the veri edg of the outer dark,i have been down to the bottom of the bottomless pit,roth
33839,33840,i have been burn in the unquench fire and have join you in the comfortless gloom,i have eaten with degener and blasphem with the impiou,roth
33841,33842,i have look into the eye of the deprav and the malici,i have familiar myself with vicious and base of all kind,roth
33843,33844,and one thing i have note as i have travel from one end of hell to the other is the wonder belief our peopl have in wicked,i tell you with great pride that i have never seen anyth to equal our corrupt,roth
33845,33846,and that is whi i do nt think we have to settl for second best,i do nt think we have to settl for anyth less than a devil who is the veri embodi of malic,roth
33847,33848,and i humbl submit to you the denizen of the greatest infern region in all creation that if elect i would be that kind of devil,well mayb it is oldfashion in some circl but to those of us who live here hell happen to be home,roth
33849,33850,and date back as it doe to the begin of time it happen to have been home to some of the most illustri name in histori,and i think that with that kind of histori and that kind of record it is high time we put hell back on the map and high time the devil wa given hi due,roth
33851,33852,now i can onli say in thi regard that mayb satan is satisfi with the fact that at least one half of the peopl present on earthand i know thi becaus i just came from thereat least one half of those peopl no longer believ in the exist of hell let alon it influenc in world affair,and mayb satan is satisfi that the devil the highest offici in the underworld onc the veri symbol of nefari to million is consid in the upper region to have absolut no power at all over the decis made there by men,roth
33853,33854,and mayb satan is satisfi when at least two third of the children in the world go to bed at night without ani fear of fire or brimston or an undi worm gnaw at the heart,incident in that connect they do nt even fear the pitchfork,roth
33855,33856,and mayb that s all right with satan too,howev let me make my posit veri clear,roth
33857,33858,it s not all right with me,mayb satan is satisfi with the statu quo well i m not,roth
33859,33860,i say that when hell is noth more than a dirti word in the mouth of most peopl live today then someth is wrong and someth ha to be done about it,what ha happen to the devil s net we use to hear so much about,roth
33861,33862,my fellow fallen it is full of hole,my fellow fallen it ha run out of steam,roth
33863,33864,and when wa the last time you heard the phrase the work of satan,can you even rememb,roth
33865,33866,mayb that s becaus after all these millennia in offic satan is satisfi with the statu quo,but i m not,roth
33867,33868,i say the devil s work is never done,i say he ha a respons to get up there among the live and wage war against the forc of righteous,roth
33869,33870,i say he ha a respons to the denizen of hell and to all soul everywher who aspir to wicked to oppos truth with falsehood,i say he ha a respons to obscur light with dark,roth
33871,33872,i say he ha a respons to entangl men s mind in error,i say he ha a respons to stir up hatr,roth
33873,33874,i say lie ha a respons to kindl content and combat,we are civil peopl in thi hous and there are some thing we do not do and that is number one,roth
33875,33876,we are not riffraff and you rememb that,we are abl to settl our own argument and conduct our own affair and we don t requir the polic to do it for us,roth

34167,34168,he would drop hi long skinni frame into a big club chair in hi uncl s live room and instantli slide half out of it so that hi armi shoe and armi sock and khaki trouser were all obstacl to cross over if you want to go by as hi cousin eleanor and her friend luci often did when he wa visit,he would sit there absolut motionless hi thumb hook around the beltless loop of hi trouser and hi chin tip down onto hi long tubular chest and when ask if he wa listen to what wa be said to him he would nod hi head without even rais hi glanc from hi shirt button,roth
34169,34170,or sometim with hi bright fair face with those blue eye as clear as day he would look up at whoever wa advis him or question him and see them through a frame that he made with hi finger,in the armi roy had develop an interest in draw and profil were hi specialti,roth
34171,34172,he wa excel on nose the bigger the better good on ear good on hair good on certain kind of chin and had bought a manual to teach himself the secret of draw a mouth which wa hi weak point,he had even begun to think that he ought to go ahead and tri to becom a profession artist,roth
34173,34174,he realiz it wa no easi row to hoe but mayb the time had come in life for him to tackl someth hard instead of settl for the easiest thing at hand,it wa hi plan to becom a profession artist that he had announc upon hi return to liberti center late in august he had bare set down hi duffel bag in the live room when the first argument began,roth
34175,34176,you would have thought he wa a kid return home from camp gitch gume instead of the aleutian island,if he had forgotten in the time away what life had been like for him dure hi last year of high school it did not take lloyd and alic bassart more than half an hour to refresh hi recollect,roth
34177,34178,the argument which went on for day consist for the most part of hi parent say they had had experi he hadn t and roy say that now he had had experi they hadn t,after all it just might be he said that hi opinion count for sinc what they were discuss wa hi career,roth
34179,34180,to make a point in fact he spent the whole of hi third day home copi a girl s profil off a matchbook cover,he work it over and over and over take just a quick break for lunch and onli after an entir afternoon behind the lock door of hi bedroom did he believ he had gotten it right,roth
34181,34182,he address three differ envelop after dinner until he wa satisfi with the letter and then sent the pictur off to the art school which wa in kansa citi all the way downtown to the post offic to be sure that it made the even mail,when a return letter announc that mr,roth
34183,34184,roy basket had won a fivehundreddollar correspond cours for onli fortynin fifti he tend to agre with hi uncl julian that it wa some kind of clip joint and did not pursu the matter ani further,just the same he had prove the point he had set out to prove and right off,roth
34185,34186,when he had been call up by the draft board for hi two year servic hi father had said that he hope a littl militari disciplin would do someth toward matur hi son,he himself seem will to admit bungl the job,roth
34187,34188,well the way thing turn out roy had matur and plenti too,but it wasn t disciplin that had done it it wa to put it bluntli be away from them,roth
34189,34190,in high school he may have been will to slide through with c s and cminus when with a littl applic of hi intellig alic bassart which you have roy in abund he could easili have had straight b even a s if he had want them,but the point he wish to make wa that he wa no longer that c student and no longer would be treat like him either,roth
34191,34192,if he put hi mind to a job he could do it and do it well,the onli problem now wa which job it wa go to be,roth
34193,34194,at the age of twenti nobodi had to tell him that it wa high time to begin think about becom a man,becaus he wa think about it and plenti don t worri,roth
34195,34196,he continu to work on hi own out of the art manual in exasper move on to the neck and the shoulder after four day of go from bad to wors with the mouth,though he by no mean relinquish hi first choic of be a profession artist he wa will to meet hi famili halfway and at least listen to whatev suggest they might have,roth
34197,34198,he had to admit be tempt by uncl julian s suggest that he come to work for him and learn the laundromat busi from the ground up,what wa particularli appeal about the idea wa that the peopl in the town along the river would see him drive around in julian s pickup truck and think of him as some punk kid and the ladi who manag the laundromat would think of him as the boss s nephew and suppos hi life wa just a bed of in actual hi real work would onli begin at night after everyon wa asleep and behind hi bedroom door he stay awak till dawn perfect hi talent,roth
34199,34200,what wasn t too appeal wa the idea of use famili as a crutch and right at the outset,he couldn t bear the thought of hear for the rest of hi life of cours it wa julian gave him hi start but of more signific wa the damag that accept someth like thi could do to hi individu,roth
34201,34202,not onli would he never realli respect himself if he just step into a job and rose sole on the basi of person privileg but how would he ever realiz hi own potenti if he wa go to be treat like one of those rich kid who were just coddl up the ladder of success their whole life long,and there wa julian to consid,roth
34203,34204,he said he wa altogeth seriou about the offer provid roy realli want to work the long hard hour he would demand of him,well the long hard hour didn t bother him,roth
34205,34206,a realli viciou mess sergeant had onc just out of mean kept him on kp for seventeen consecut hour scrub pot and pan and after that experi roy realiz he could do just about anyth,so onc he had made up hi mind about the direct hi life wa go to take he had everi throw julian s languag right back at work hi ball into the ground,roth
34207,34208,but what if he went in with julian start take a salari and then decid to go off in septemb to the art institut in chicago or even to art school in new york which wa by no mean imposs,he wa give hi parent object everi consider whether they appreci that or not but if he final did decid in favor of profession artist as a career wouldn t he have wast not onli hi time but julian s as well,roth
34209,34210,probabl to hi uncl whose affect he valu he would wind up seem mayb that would even be sort of true,ingratitud wa someth he had to guard against in himself,roth
34211,34212,though he wa sure hi classmat at school and hi buddi in the servic thought of him as easygo and first sergeant use to sometim call him steppin had been told he had a tendenc to be selfish,not that everybodi didn t have one of cours but certain peopl had a way of exagger thing all out of proport and he just didn t feel like give an ounc of support to a suspicion about him which it wa actual unfair for anybodi particularli a person s own father to hold in the first place,roth
34213,34214,moreov what he had a real tast for follow the monotoni and tedium of the preced month wa adventur and you couldn t realli expect that the laundromat busi would be pack with thrill or even particularli interest to be frank about it,as for the secur angl money realli didn t matter that much to him,roth
34215,34216,he now had two thousand dollar in save and separ pay plu the gi,bill and anyway he had no ambit to be a millionair,roth
34217,34218,that s whi when hi father told him that artist wind up live in garret roy wa abl to say what s so wrong with that,what do you think a garret is,roth
34219,34220,it s an attic,my own room use to be the attic you know a fact mr,roth
34221,34222,bassart couldn t easili disput,what he had a tast for wa adventur someth to test himself against some way to discov just how much of an individu he realli wa,roth
