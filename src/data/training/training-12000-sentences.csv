1,2,he insisted on washing his underclothes and his socks in the bathroom rather than parting with the few quarters that it cost to use the washerdryer in the basement laundry room every time i came to see him there were his grayish misshapen things draped over wire hangers on the shower rod and the towel racks,though he prided himself on being nattily dressed and always enjoyed putting on a nicely tailored new sports jacket or a threepiece hickeyfreeman suit enjoyed it particularly when he d bought it at an endofseason sale he had taken to cutting corners on whatever wasn t visible to anyone else,roth
3,4,his pajamas and handkerchiefs like his underwear and socks looked as though they hadn t been replaced since my mother s death,when i got to his apartment that the inadvertent visit to my mother s quickly excused myself and went off to the toilet,roth
5,6,first i d missed a turnoff and now in the bathroom i was taking another few minutes to rehearse for a final time the best way to tell him about the tumor,while i stood over the bowl his undergarments hung all around me like remnants strung out by a farmer to scare the birds away,roth
7,8,on the open shelves above the toilet where there was an assortment of prescription drugs as well as his polident vaseline and ascriptin his boxes of tissues qtips and absorbent cotton i spotted the shaving mug that had once been my grandfather s in it my father kept his razor and a tube of shaving cream,the mug was pale blue porcelain a delicate floral design enclosed a wide white panel at the front and inside the panel the name s,roth
9,10,roth and the date were inscribed in faded gold gothic lettering,the mug was our one family heirloom as far as i knew aside from a handful of antique snapshots the only thing tangible that anyone had cared to save from the immigrant years in newark,roth
11,12,i had been intrigued by it ever since my grandfather had died a month short of my seventh birthday and it made its way into our newark bathroom back when my father was still shaving with a bristle brush and shaving soap,sender roth had been a remote mysterious presence to me as a small boy an elongated man with an undersized forebear whom my own skeleton most about whom all i knew was that he smoked all day long spoke only yiddish and wasn t much given to fondling the american grandchildren when we all showed up with our parents on sundays,roth
13,14,after his death the shaving mug in our bathroom brought him much more fully to life for me not as a grandfather but even more interestingly then as an ordinary man among men a customer of a barbershop where his mug was kept on a shelf with the mugs of the other neighborhood immigrants,it reassured me as a child to think that in that household where according to all reports there was never a penny to spare a dime was set aside every week for him to go to the barbershop and get his sabbath shave,roth
15,16,my grandfather roth had studied to be a rabbi in polish galicia in a small town not far from lemberg but when he arrived in america alone in without his wife and his three sons my uncles charlie morris and ed he took a job in a hat factory to earn the money to bring his family over and worked there more or less most of his life,there were seven children born between and six sons and a daughter and all but the last two of the boys and the one girl left school after the eighth grade to find jobs to help support the family,roth
17,18,the shaving mug inscribed s,roth had seemed to free my only momentarily if only for those few minutes he quietly sat being shaved in the barber s chair late on a friday the dour exigencies that had trapped him and that i imagined accounted for his austere uncommunicative nature,roth
19,20,his mug emitted the aura of an archaeological find an artifact signaling an unexpected level of cultural refinement an astonishing superfluity in an otherwise cramped and obstructed our ordinary little newark bathroom it had the impact on me of a greek vase depicting the mythic origins of the race,by what amazed me about it was that my father hadn t thrown it out or given it away,roth
21,22,over the years when it was within his power he had gotten rid of just about everything useless to which any of us might have been thought to have a sentimental attachment,though these seizures of largess were on the whole admirably motivated they sometimes lacked sensitivity to innate property rights,roth
23,24,so eager was he to answer the need real or imagined of the recipient that he did not always think about the effect of his impulsiveness on the unwitting donor,my twovolume stamp collection for instance studiously acquired by me throughout my late grade school collection partially inspired by the example of the country s most famous philatelist franklin delano roosevelt and underwritten with virtually all my gave away to a greatnephew of his the year i went off to college,roth
25,26,i didn t know this until ten years later when i was thinking of drawing on my scholarly discoveries as a boy stamp collector for an episode in a piece of fiction and went down to my parents house in moorestown to get the albums out of the attic,it was only after i had searched thoroughly but in vain through the cartons i d stored there that my mother not until we were off alone how they had come to disappear,roth
27,28,she assured me that she had tried to stop him that she had told him that my stamps weren t his to dispose of but he wouldn t listen,he told her that i was grown up away at college didn t use the stamps anymore whereas chickie his greatnephew could bring them with him to school et cetera et cetera et cetera,roth
29,30,i suppose i could have found out if any part of my collection even existed any longer by contacting relative who was virtually a stranger to me and by then a young married i decided to let the whole thing drop,i was terrifically irritated to hear what he had when i remembered how much of my childhood had gone into that collection genuinely as it was so long ago that he had done it and as i had rather more difficult problems to deal with i was in the midst of an acrimonious marital separation i said nothing to him,roth
31,32,and even if i had been inclined to it would have been no easier for me to criticize him to his face at twentyeight than it had been at eighteen or eight since his most blatantly thoughtless acts were invariably ignited by this spontaneous impulse to support to assist to rescue to save prompted by the conviction that what he was away my stamps for generous helpful and morally or educationally efficacious,i believe another motive was operating in harder to fathom and we came back from burying my mother in may of and even as the apartment began filling up with family and friends he disappeared into the bedroom and started emptying her bureau drawers and sorting through the clothes in her closet,roth
33,34,i was still at the door with my brother welcoming the mourners who d followed us back from the cemetery and so i wouldn t right off have known what he was up to had not my mother s sister millie rushed out of the bedroom and down the hallway calling for help,the bed was already strewn with dresses coats skirts and blouses pulled from the closet and he was now busily chucking things from a corner of her lowest bureau drawer into a plastic garbage bag,roth
35,36,i put my hand on his shoulder and gripped it forcefully,people are here for you i said they want to see you to talk to what good is this stuff anymore,roth
37,38,it s no good to me hanging here,this stuff can go to jewish s in mint stop stop,roth
39,40,there s time for all this later,we ll do it together later,roth
41,42,stop throwing things out i said,pull yourself together,roth
43,44,he didn t appear to be either in a daze or in the throes of a hysterical was simply doing what he had done all his life the next difficult job,thirty minutes before we had buried her body now to dispose of her things,roth
45,46,i ushered him out of the bedroom and once among the guests who had come to offer condolences he immediately began talking away assuring everyone that he was fine,i returned to the bedroom to remove from the garbage bag the pile of mementos that he d already discarded and that my mother had neatly and carefully saved over the them in a tiny brown envelope my phi beta kappa key which she had coveted a collection of programs to family graduation exercises birthday cards from my brother and me a handful of telegrams announcing good news clippings friends had sent her about me and my books specially prized snapshots of her two grandsons as small boys,roth
47,48,they were all items for which my father could imagine no function now that she who had treasured them was gone the sentimental keepsakes of someone whose sentiments had been snuffed out forever two nights earlier at a seafood restaurant where as was their custom they had gone with friends for sunday night dinner,my mother had just been served clam chowder a favorite dish of hers to everyone s surprise she had announced i don t want this soup and those were her last moment later she was dead of a massive coronary,roth
49,50,it was my father s primitivism that stunned me,standing all alone emptying her drawers and her closets he seemed driven by some instinct that might be natural to a wild beast or an aboriginal tribesman but ran counter to just about every mourning rite that had evolved in civilized societies to mitigate the sense of loss among those who survive the death of a loved one,roth
51,52,yet there was also something almost admirable in this pitilessly realistic determination to acknowledge instantaneously that he was now an old man living alone and that symbolic relics were no substitute for the real companion of fiftyfive years,it seemed to me that it was not out of fear of her things and their ghostlike power that he wanted to rid the apartment of them without bury them now because he refused to sidestep the most brutal of all facts,roth
53,54,never in his life as far as i knew had he been one to try to elude the force of a dreadful blow and yet as i later learned on the evening of her death he had fled from her corpse,this occurred not at the restaurant where she had in fact died but at the hospital where she was declared dead after the paramedics had worked in vain to revive her on the ambulance ride from the restaurant to the emergency room,roth
55,56,at the hospital they pushed her stretcher into a cubicle of its own and when my father who had followed the ambulance in his car went in by himself to look at her he could not stand to see what he saw and so he ran,it was months before he could speak about this to anyone and when he did it wasn t to me or to my brother but to claire who as a woman could grant him the womanly absolution he required to begin to shed his shame,roth
57,58,though he wasn t himself equipped to account for why he d run away like that i wondered if it hadn t something to do with his realizing that he might have contributed to the heart attack by pushing my mother that afternoon to walk beyond her endurance,she had been suffering for some time from severe shortness of breath and unknown to me from angina during the previous winter there had also been a long siege of arthritic pain that had demoralized her terribly,roth
59,60,that winter she d had all she could do just to sit up comfortably in a chair but on the day she died because the may weather was so beautiful and she was finally out of doors getting some exercise they d walked as far as the drugstore three very long city blocks away and then because he insisted it would be good for her they d also walked all the way home,according to aunt my mother had phoned before they went out for the the time they d reached the drugstore she was already hopelessly exhausted,roth
61,62,i didn t think i could get back she d reported to my aunt but instead of calling a taxi or waiting for a bus they had rested a little on a nearby bench and then he d got her up on her feet for the return trek,you know your father my aunt had said to me,roth
63,64,he told her she could do it she had spent the rest of the afternoon on the bed trying to recover enough strength to go out to dinner,as it happened only an hour or so before they d left for their walk i d made my customary sunday call from england and told her playfully that i expected her to go a mile with me down the country road outside my house when she and my father came to visit that summer,roth
65,66,she replied i don t know if it ll be a mile dear but i ll try she was sounding bright and confident for the first time in months and could well have gone off that afternoon hoping to begin to prepare herself for our summer stroll,in fact when i arrived back in america the next day and took a taxi from kennedy directly over to elizabeth my father s first words to me were well she won t be taking that walk phil he was in her reclining chair his body decrepit his face batteredlooking and drained of all life,roth
67,68,i thought not incorrectly as it turned out this is what he will look like when he is dead my brother sandy and his wife helen had arrived earlier in the day from chicago and were at the apartment when i got there,sandy had already been to the funeral home to arrange for the burial the next day,roth
69,70,before he d gone my father had spoken on the phone to the elderly funeral director a man with whom my mother had attended elizabeth s battin high around the end of the first world war,my father in tears had told him take care of her body take good care of it higgins then for the rest of the day he went on weeping there in that chair in which she would stretch out after supper and try to get some relief from her arthritis while they watched the news together,roth
71,72,she ordered new england clam chowder he told me as i kneeled beside him still in my coat and holding his hand and i ordered manhattan,when it came she said i don t want this soup i said take ll switch but she was gone,roth
73,74,just slumped forward,didn t even fall,roth
75,76,made no trouble for anyone,my father was a more difficult personality far less seductive and less malleable too bluntly resisting points of view that diverged only slightly from his own reigning biases was in fact one of his most rigorously unthinking activities,roth
77,78,still kneeling before him with his hand in mine i understood just how much we were going to have to help i couldn t understand was how we were going to get through to him,his obsessive stubborn very nearly driven my mother to a breakdown in her final years since his retirement at the age of sixtythree her once spirited housewifely independence had been all but extinguished by his anxious overbearing bossiness,roth
79,80,for years he had believed he was married to perfection and for years he wasn t far mother was one of those devoted daughters of jewish immigrants who raised housekeeping in america to a great art,don t talk to anyone in my family about saw cleaning in its heyday,roth
81,82,but then my father retired from one of the metropolitan life s big south jersey offices where he d been managing a staff of fiftytwo people and the efficient clearcut division of labor that had done so much to define their marriage as a success gradually began to be him,he had nothing to do and she had everything to that wouldn t do,roth
83,84,you know what i am now he told me sadly on his sixtyfifth birthday,i m bessie s husband and by neither temperament nor training was he suited to be that alone,roth
85,86,so after a couple of years of volunteer at the va,hospital in east orange with jewish relief groups and the red even of working as an underling for a friend who owned a hardware store he settled down to become bessie s my mother happened not to need a boss having been her own since her singlehanded establishment of a firstclass domesticmanagement and mothering company back in when my brother was born,roth
87,88,just the summer before her death during a weekend visit to connecticut when we two were alone having a cup of tea in the kitchen she had announced that she was thinking of getting a divorce,to hear the word divorce from my mother s lips astonished me almost as much as it would have if she had uttered an obscenity,roth
89,90,but then the inmost intertwining of mother and father s life together the difficulties and disappointments and enduring strains remain mysterious really forever perhaps particularly if you grew up as a good boy in a secure wellordered simultaneously as a good girl,people don t always realize what good girls we grew up as too the little sons suckled and gurgled by mothers as adroit as my own in the skills of nurturing domesticity,roth
91,92,for a very long and impressionable time the male who s not around all day remains much more remote and mythological than the palpable woman of wizardly proficiency anchored firmly during the decades when i was young in the odorous kitchen where her jurisdiction was absolute and her authority divine,but ma i said it s late for a divorce no,roth
93,94,you re seventysix but she was crying quite pitifully already,that astonished me too,roth
95,96,he doesn t listen to what i say she said,he interrupts all the time to talk about something else,roth
97,98,when we re out that s the worst,then he won t let me speak at all,roth
99,100,if i start to he just shuts me up,in front of everyone,roth
101,102,as though i don t exist tell him not to do it i said,it wouldn t make any difference then tell him a second time and if it still doesn t work get up and say i m going home and go oh darling i couldn t,roth
103,104,no i couldn t embarrass him like that,not with company but you tell me he embarrasses you when you re with company that s different,roth
105,106,he s not like me,he couldn t take it philip,roth
107,108,he would crumble up,it would kill him three months after her death in august i came down from connecticut to take him to the jewish federation plaza in west orange where we were to look at the living accommodations for retired and elderly people,roth
109,110,the plaza had been recommended to us by an old newark friend of my brother s a new jersey attorney on the federation s board of directors,he had said he might be able to help my father get an apartment without too long a delay if my father was interested,roth
111,112,the plaza residents lived in twoand threeroom apartments of their own but the round of life itself was strongly communal each evening they ate together in a dining room where their meals were prepared for them and they had easy access to all the group activities at the flourishing y next door,west orange was still one of newark s pleasant suburbs and the plaza as it was described to me was situated back on a green hillside overlooking a main thoroughfare a few minutes walk from a shopping center and also from the temple b nai abraham which like the y had been transplanted from decaying newark and served the elderly as a cultural center as well as a synagogue,roth
113,114,in all the plaza struck me as a place where he would not lack for companionship and i was hoping that after we had looked around the idea of moving might appeal to him,i was afraid that if he tried much longer to hang on by himself in the elizabeth apartment he might literally die there of loneliness,roth
115,116,his meals when he even sat down and ate them seemed to consist mostly of boiled hot dogs and heinz baked beans and when i phoned in the middle of the day i often found him asleep or in tears,it was clear to me when i arrived at the apartment that day that he had been sitting there crying by himself,roth
117,118,he could have been crying since he d got up for all i knew he could have been crying all night long,he d spent a few weeks with us in connecticut in june and then again in july and had seemed in that time to have gotten on top of the worst of his grief but now that he was back in the apartment without my mother he was hopelessly bereft all over again,roth
119,120,though outside it was a beautiful august day he was sitting there with the shades down and no lights on,i noticed that his clothes while clean didn t quite match as if getting out of bed he d pulled on whatever came to hand first,roth
121,122,when i asked what he d had for breakfast he answered nothing,something,roth
123,124,just what you always wanted,here i produced from the bag a toilet bowl brush and a bottle of lysol that i d bought at the local general store before leaving connecticut three hours earlier,roth
125,126,i d also brought a bottle of milligram valium,the idea was to get him off the milligram tablets that i d got for him after her death to help him sleep,roth
127,128,come on i said,if you insist on being your own cleaning i began but he cut me off abruptly,roth
129,130,what do i need to pay somebody when i can do it myself,i get up at five and i begin vacuuming,roth
131,132,i swore i swore to myself when she died that i was going to keep this place the way mother did those words alone got him crying again,in the living room i gave him the new bottle of milligram valium and told him that if he needed it he should now take one of these at night and pour the others down the drain,roth
133,134,with this he didn t argue though he was someone who previously would balk at the thought of taking even an aspirin,i was not so lucky when i reminded him that we were due at the jewish federation plaza at one o clock,roth
135,136,he told me dismissively that he wasn t interested,the hell with it he said,roth
137,138,i m fine right here,you re not being fair,roth
139,140,instead of treating me like a member of your family do me a favor and pretend you re still the manager of an insurance office,if somebody came to you at the metropolitan with a proposal that he thought might be of help to you you d at least let the guy make his case,roth
141,142,you d sit back and hear him out and then you d think it over and come up with your decision,you certainly wouldn t say after inviting him to talk to you the hell with it and not even listen,roth
143,144,i m proposing to you only that we go up and look at the place as we agreed we would a week ago,it is not a nursing home and it is not an old people s home or anything resembling s a new apartment complex that people are lining up to get into and that s designed to make life comfortable and companionable for among other people men and women in your fix,roth
145,146,it may be for you and it may not be for you but there s no way for us to find out if you don t cooperate,okay he said with great decisiveness and shot energetically up off the sofa,roth
147,148,i wasn t sure that i d ever before been so foolish as to try,that s more like it i said,roth
149,150,maybe you want to go in first and do something about your socks,you ve got two different colors on,roth
151,152,and i don t know if that checked shirt goes with those plaid trousers,the federation plaza was new and in excellent repair but looked more institutional than residential a cross between a small college dormitory and a minimumsecurity prison,roth
153,154,we were to be meeting with a woman named isabel berkowitz a resident who had volunteered to show us around,we had her apartment number but as the approach to the building was a maze of walkways i stopped two very elderly women who were talking together on the main path leading down to northfield avenue and asked if they could direct us to isabel berkowitz s,roth
155,156,my name is berkowitz also one of them answered,she spoke with a yiddish accent that along with her dress and her manner made her appear to have more in common with my grandparents generation than with my mother and father and their friends,roth
157,158,i was pretty sure my father was thinking the same he wasn t the kind of old person these old people were and what s more he didn t belong here,i m the other berkowitz she told us cheerily,roth
159,160,berkowitz from where my father asked her,where else,roth
161,162,in his apartment he had been sullen and angry driving up to west orange he d been silent and grim but he had only to come on someone who had known someone he had known in newark to become blissfully energetic gregarious very much the forceful insurance man whose years in newark as an agent and assistant manager had familiarized him with nearly every jewish family in the city,unmindful by now not only of his woes but even of what we were there for he named for this other mrs,roth
163,164,berkowitz all the shopkeepers whose businesses abutted her husband s central avenue store some forty years back,i stood by till he had finished exhibiting to them his perfect memory and then i asked the old woman once again if she could tell us how to get to where we wanted to go,roth
165,166,it turned out that she couldn t,when she tried she became befuddled all at once wholly unable to focus her mind,roth
167,168,my father noticed too and once again without his even having to tell me i heard him insisting that he wasn t this kind of old person,berkowitz we were looking for my quickwitted lively attractive woman who looked ten years younger than her seventy years,roth
169,170,her tworoom apartment though a bit cubelike was bright with sunlight and the walls were hung with lots of little paintings she d collected over the years,there was even one she d painted herself a colorful stilllife and framed alongside it were samples of her embroidery,roth
171,172,she seemed delighted to see us and immediately offered us something cold to drink and within only five minutes of meeting her when we two were momentarily alone again my father turned to me and said she s some girl though isabel who d begun her career as a brooklyn nurse and eventually became a public health administrator in new york may have been a touch more worldly than my mother her mixture of outgoing vitality and goodnatured gentility reminded me very much of what my mother had been like when i was growing up,the resemblance could even have been what prompted my we were waiting out in the corridor for isabel to lock up her apartment and take us on a tour of the announce spontaneously as though all his troubles were over i love her,roth
173,174,she and her late vigorous selfmade man with a cv,much like my father lived in a spacious apartment in jersey city with a view out to the statue of liberty,roth
175,176,but she had decided to give it up and move to the plaza because she had had a bad time with her health recently and because she wanted to be near the berkowitzes,my father surprised me by saying yes they re a wonderful family he d given no indication till that moment that he knew isabel s berkowitzes as well as the other woman s berkowitzes,roth
177,178,but then maybe he was only trying to ingratiate himself with a woman toward whom he seemed drawn by an undisguisable surprisingly headlong tug of feeling,as we were walking down the corridor isabel berkowitz said to me so you re philip roth,roth
179,180,in fact so busy was he presenting his jewish joke repertoire he barely bothered to look at the facilities that isabel was beginning to show us,we walked through the dining hall which was clean and simple a large room that looked just like a school cafeteria we peered through an open door into the kitchen where the equipment was all shining and spotless and a heavyset black woman sat at a long table methodically cutting wedges of lettuce for several hundred dinner salads we crossed over from the plaza to the y and looked into rooms where meetings were in progress and card games were going on and though i kept hoping for him to begin to respond if only with a little curiosity to the life around him and for him to see in not necessarily now in the days to way out of his loneliness his attention was riveted on isabel for whom he was now recounting stories not entirely unfamiliar to me about his childhood in immigrant newark,roth
181,182,a day camp was in session at the y and when we went to look at the gym there were some thirty little children sitting in a circle on the gymnasium floor listening to their two counselors explain a new game,aren t our jewish children beautiful isabel said but if she was trying to get him to see what was in front of his eyes it didn t even looking where she pointed he continued describing newark in,roth
183,184,only at the office of the director of the y did the reminiscing momentarily abate while he told the director and his assistant there that the director of the elizabeth y where he was a morning regular several times a week was no damn good the elizabeth director never came into the health club to talk to the men he had no idea what was going on with them and my father told them all bluntly he himself didn t get along with the man at all,i don t even bother with him,roth
185,186,i organized the roth raiders my special little group of alte kockers and we have a good time on our own,the hell with him you re the kind of person we need here the director replied but the veiled invitation elicited no response,roth
187,188,in the corridor outside the director s office we ran into bleiberg the president of the plaza social organization a man of about seventyfive suffering from multiple sclerosis,isabel introduced us,roth
189,190,bleiberg,bleiberg,roth
191,192,i remember you bleiberg my father told him,you were a jeweler on green street bleiberg had indeed been a jeweler on newark s green street,roth
193,194,how do you like living here mr,bleiberg i asked,roth
195,196,i love it bleiberg said while my father said sure green street,i ll tell you who else was on green street and did just that,roth
197,198,when we were back in the car later i suggested that we drive up the road to look at the shopping center where there was a bookstore and a bank and a coffee shop and where isabel had told us plaza residents sometimes went for lunch,afterward i said we could drive over to see the new b nai abraham,roth
199,200,there s nothing to see he said,but don t you want to take a look at the temple,roth
201,202,though that s a first impression,let it sink in a little,roth
203,204,i ll bring the popcorn she d said with a charming smile,for that matter neither did i inside the apartment i went around raising the shades to let the light in while he went to the bathroom,roth
205,206,when i was growing up bill and his late wife leah had lived not far from our leslie street apartment just across the newark line in irvington,in the early along with their younger son herbie who was my brother s age they d shared a small summer cottage at the jersey shore with us and two other families all of them friends of my parents going back to before the war,roth
207,208,bill had installed and serviced oil furnaces and may have been the only close family friend who was a skilled laborer as opposed to a salesman or a shopkeeper and who came home from work filthy at the end of the day,as a young marine in world war i bill had been stationed at guantánamo in cuba where he d played the trumpet in the marine band and now in his middle eighties a little hard of hearing but otherwise quite fit he maintained that he heard the tunes that he used to play with the marine band being played inside his teeth,roth
209,210,that s not possible my father told him categorically,herman i hear it bill said,roth
211,212,i m hearing it now you can t be i am,it s like in my mouth a radio is playing i had flown from london to florida to visit my father and the three of us were sitting in their little kitchen eating the bologna sandwiches that my father had prepared for lunch,roth
213,214,what do you hear exactly i asked bill,tonight,roth
215,216,the marine hymn he said,from the halls of montezuma he began singing,roth
217,218,you re imagining it my father insisted,some years back as a result of surgery he d lost the musculature in his midsection and developed a stomach but otherwise he was for his age a most fitlooking man of medium height whose spontaneous unassuming virility and spirited decency had made him instantaneously appealing to the widows around,roth
219,220,he had been impressively strong through the arms and the chest when he was young and a little of that solidity was still discernible in his upper torso particularly so with this resurgence of vitality,though he could be bluntly outspoken and dominate a conversation with his boiling antirepublican diatribes he happened to be an agreeablelooking person as well and the mundane forthrightness his appearance exuded registered on all sorts of people as real charm,roth
221,222,if he d had the leisure for it or the instinct or the need he might even have been handsome in an anonymous sort of way but handsome was no asset where he d fought his battles and long ago he had settled upon looks people trusted rather than envied or praised,now of course his hair was very thin and had only a touch of brown left in it and his face though unlined had slackened along the jawline into the pronounced family dewlap and his ears seemed somehow to have been tugged a bit like taffy and lengthened,roth
223,224,only his eyes really remained beautiful and you never would have known that unless you happened to be nearby when he slipped off his glasses for a moment,then you would have seen how much gray there was in those eyes and that there was even some green close you would have seen how gentle and untroubled those eyes were as though they alone had existed since beyond the reverberations of that crude imperfect homemade dynamo whose stubborn output had driven him through the obstacle course just about everything had been,roth
225,226,his florida recovery may have owed something to his having found in bill weber a fairly good standin for my goodnatured eventempered untroublesome partner whose faults and failings he could correct unceasingly,i caught him improving bill virtually the moment i arrived in bal harbour,roth
227,228,when i got off the elevator on their floor there were my father and bill heading down the hallway together some twenty feet in front of me,instead of calling out to them i followed silently behind listening while my father berated bill for his social shortcomings,roth
229,230,ask her to a movie ask her out to t just sit home night after night i don t want to take her out herman,i don t want to take anybody out you re antisocial if that s what you call it okay i am you live like a hermit okay not okay,roth
231,232,you ve got to mix more with people,there are women around here who are dying for companionship,roth
233,234,i m not talking about women with hangups,not all of them want to possess you,roth
235,236,not all of them want to sink their teeth into you i don t want a woman,there s nothing i can do for a woman,roth
237,238,i m eightysix years old herman c mon for christ s sake i m not talking about that,i m talking about eating a pleasant meal with somebody socializing with people like a human being you re good at it i m not,roth
239,240,i ll stay home i don t understand you bill,the elderly russianborn violinist the ensemble leader was said to be viennatrained by the people my father had introduced me to at the pool that afternoon,roth
241,242,they had told me that if i liked music i should be sure to come the concert was to take place following the weekly meeting of the galahad hall social club and would be attended by nearly all those in galahad hall who were ambulatory and even as i would see by some in wheelchairs and on walkers who were accompanied by their nurses,there was entertainment or a slide show or a lecture every week refreshments were served and i was assured that i would have a good time,roth
243,244,after our dinner of hot dogs and by my father while bill neatly set three places at the father told bill to put on a jacket and a pair of shoes and come along with us to the musicale all bill wanted was to stay upstairs and watch the pro basketball game on television but as my father wouldn t let up about bill s failure to mix with people his failure to make friends his failure to go out in the evening and have a good time bill gave in and agreed that he would come after the music for the refreshments,but after wasn t good enough and ten minutes later when my father still wouldn t leave him alone bill pulled a jacket out of the closet and put on a pair of shoes and we took the elevator to the social hall in back of the lobby where the meeting was already under way,roth
245,246,as the three of us came through the door the chairwoman of the matzoh fund which collected donations for passover provisions for the jewish poor in south miami beach was announcing the grand total raised during the matzoh fund drive,the chairwoman looked down at her notes while she spoke causing several people around the room to shout can t hear you,roth
247,248,we can t hear you belle when she looked up a little puzzled by the ruckus a man at the end of the back row who must have been her husband put a hand to the side of his mouth and called to her pretend you re talking to me everyone laughed belle loudest of all and then in a good strong voice she announced that the fund had reached its goal of two thousand dollars or the equivalent of about ten dollars from each person in the building and the audience applauded,i noticed two rows in front of us the people i d met at the pool with my father that retired bathing suit manufacturer and his wife the retired coffee and tea importer and his wife and the recently widowed woman who years ago had been a new york buyer and was my father s choice as a mate for bill weber,roth
249,250,all of them turned and waved hello as we slid into seats behind them,our three seats in the last of the fifteen or so rows were virtually the only ones left in the house,roth
251,252,four music stands and four bridge chairs had been arranged in a little semicircle at the front and off to the far side near the door was a long table set up for coffee,the refreshments were already there the plates stacked high with cookies and slices of cake covered with saran wrap,roth
253,254,when the matzoh fund report was concluded the club s president congratulated the chairwoman on the success of the drive,he was a dapper suntanned man of about passionate golfer i d been told that after his retirement as a successful leather goods and luggage manufacturer had taken a desk at merrill lynch and made a second fortune managing his own money,roth
255,256,he said ladies and gentlemen,before the music begins i want to tell you that a few moments ago a young man walked in and i d like to introduce him to you,roth
257,258,but the president said mr,i interrupted him oh you don t have to ask me questions,roth
259,260,i just came down to enjoy the music,let the music begin and i got another round of applause and sat down again,roth
261,262,bill wasn t holding my hand because he thought i was still seven but because he had known me since i was seven and he had a right to hold my hand however old i d become in the interim,over the next thirty minutes or so i came to i never entirely had when the performer was perlman or yoyo how much muscular labor goes into playing a stringed instrument,roth
263,264,in the middle of only the first movement i wondered if it was really a good idea for the viola player to go on,he was probably close to eighty a large heavyset man with a stern expressionless face and as the music heated up that face grew paler and paler and i could see him beginning to pant,roth
265,266,the performance was as alarming as it was heroic as though these four aging people were trying to push free a car that was mired in the mud and though the music didn t always sound like a haydn string quartet at the end of the first movement everyone applauded enthusiastically and some of the friends of the musicians shouted bravo,bravo and half the audience got up and began to make their way toward the refreshment table,roth
267,268,no no the club president called out jumping from the front row and turning to face the crowd,please there s more the musicians having mopped their faces and turned to a fresh page of the score waited patiently until everyone was seated and quiet again,roth
269,270,they weren t too many bars into the second movement however before the purses began clicking open and shut and couples began quietly gabbing together,directly in front of me a nicely dressed old woman who had a cane at her feet and a neatly stacked pile of bills on her lap was discreetly writing out checks and then clipping each check to the appropriate bill and putting it in an envelope,roth
271,272,she had even brought along a roll of stamps,it was better than paying her bills upstairs alone,roth
273,274,a little victor herbert he whispered a little clarinet an oboe a french horn,there had been something sort of goodnatured and selfdisciplined about the way they d gone back to their chairs and sat there that reminded me of people sitting through the prayers in the synagogue when i was a after the reading of the torah the thing still went on and on and people had no idea what anyone was reading but they sat there nicely out of respect,roth
275,276,of course there were always a few in the synagogue who sat there on and on because they couldn t get enough of it but that didn t look to have been the case at the musicale in galahad hall,the club president was going from one musician to the other shaking each player s violist could barely lift his head by then let alone a hand and i continued to wonder if something medical ought not to be done for then the president turned to the audience and waved both arms high in the air bidding us to clap even louder,roth
277,278,that s it ladies and gentlemen,every artist i don t care who he is needs to know if you like him or not,roth
279,280,bravo the applause had turned into a rhythmic pounding with wild overtones of a kind you couldn t have imagined emanating from this temperate crowd but their relief at being sprung was that great,the applause was loudest from those who had bounded out of their seats and were already lined up two deep in front of the refreshment table,roth
281,282,ladies and gentlemen,good news,roth
283,284,i thought plates would go sailing through the air from the direction of the refreshment table,i thought somebody might just walk up and put a foot through the cello,roth
285,286,but no these were decent people who had lived a long time who had known and endured their share of grief before jewish people who had been born back when cultivation still had even for untutored jews its religious clout and so their deference to anyone who picked up a bow and a opposed to a bow and an simply insurmountable,agonizing as the prospect was they kept their misery to themselves and returned yet again to their seats many bearing coffee cups and cake plates which they balanced on their knees or placed at their feet while the first violinist s wife a petite whitehaired woman who had been sitting in the first row stepped energetically out of the audience and sat down at a piano that was off to the side of the quartet,roth
287,288,as the violist the cellist and the second violinist looked on in exhaustion the first violinist a man of the most remarkable stamina for his years joined his wife in a duet by fritz kreisler,it was awful,roth
289,290,jack benny played better,again,roth
291,292,to sit with your ice cream and the television,estelle is here he said pointing to where the exbuyer could be seen talking animatedly to the first violinist s wife who was at the piano still playing something that nobody was listening to,roth
293,294,the audience didn t dare to listen,they hadn t even applauded the encore for fear that it would unleash yet another one,roth
295,296,talk to estelle will you my father begged bill,what am i going to do with that guy my father asked me as we pushed into the throng at the refreshment table,roth
297,298,why not nothing i suggested airily,so he can sit there every night by himself,roth
299,300,in just my first few days there he took me for drinks at the homes of three wealthy jewish widows ranging in age from sixtyfive to seventyfive all of them quite polished and attractive and according to my father eager to press on with their relationship,walking to their condominiums he would tell me about the businesses their husbands had established how many children they had and what businesses the children had succeeded in the state of their health the tragedies in their lives how much their apartments were worth and then on the way back home he would ask well what did you think each time i answered altogether truthfully she seemed very nice,roth
301,302,i liked her he d then reply she wants me to go on a cruise with her next fall or you know what she tells me,her apartment is twice what she needs,roth
303,304,she rattles around there all by and i would ask,and nothing,roth
305,306,me i just listen i don t say nothin,phil it s too soon,roth
307,308,and here he would burst into tears and though he didn t sob with the alarming abandon of those first months after my mother s death the emotional flow was still considerable,i didn t know how sick she was he told me,roth
309,310,if i had had any idea nobody knew i assured him,there s nothing anybody could have done oh bessie he cried bessie bessie i didn t know i didn t realize,roth
311,312,later the two of us would go to dinner together and after he d drunk a vodka gibson with his shrimp cocktail i would suggest to him that it would be no crime if he went on a cruise in the fall with cora b or if he decided next winter to share the apartment of blanche k and he in turn would recount for me exemplary stories illustrating my mother s modesty humility loyalty bravery efficiency dependability and then we would walk back to the apartment where bill was watching television in his undershorts and my father would start giving it to him for sitting all night by himself,so having arrived at his apartment from my mother s grave i d gone into the toilet where while eyeing my grandfather s shaving mug i d rehearsed my lines for the fiftieth time then i d come back out into the living room and looked at him slumped down in a corner of the sofa waiting for the verdict,roth
313,314,lil waited in the other corner of the sofa,and from then on lil was so silent she might as well not have been there,roth
315,316,you have a serious problem i began but it can be dealt with,you have a tumor in your head,roth
317,318,dr,meyerson says that given the location the chances are ninetyfive percent that it s benign i had intended like meyerson to be candid and describe it as large but i couldn t,roth
319,320,that there was a tumor seemed enough for him to take in,not that he had registered any shock as sat there emotionless waiting for me to go on,roth
321,322,it s pressing on the facial nerve and that s what s caused the paralysis meyerson had told me that it was wrapped around the facial nerve but i couldn t say that either,my evasiveness reminded me of his on the night my mother had died,roth
323,324,at midnight london time he had told me that my mother had had a serious heart attack and that i d better make arrangements to fly home because they didn t know if she was going to survive,it doesn t look good phil he said but an hour later when i phoned back to tell him my flight plans for the next morning he began to cry and revealed that she had actually died in the restaurant where they had had dinner a few hours earlier,roth
325,326,it s not bell s palsy he said,no,roth
327,328,it s a tumor,but it s not malignant and it s operable,roth
329,330,he can operate if we want him to,dr,roth
331,332,meyerson wants to speak to you about an operation,i think it s a good idea to go back and talk to him now that we know what s up,roth
333,334,i think that all of us should sit down together in his office and see if an operation is feasible,i see he said and then he fell silent and then he was lost alone and lost and i wouldn t have been surprised if right then he had died,roth
335,336,his eyes were looking out to nowhere onto nothing like someone who had just been fatally shot,he was gone like that for about a minute,roth
337,338,then having absorbed the blow he was back in the midst of the struggle estimating the scale of his loss,the operation as i understand it will prevent anything further from happening unless the operation were itself to make something further happen but i didn t go into that,roth
339,340,i would let meyerson apprise him of the risks as well as of the size of the tumor and the encasement of the facial nerve,will it grow back he asked,roth
341,342,i don t know,i wouldn t think so but you ll have to ask the doctor,roth
343,344,we ll make up a list of questions,of the fifteen percent who meyerson allowed were worse after the surgery weren t they zombies or close enough to what my father meant by a zombie,roth
345,346,where is it he asked,in front of the brain stem,roth
347,348,that s at the base of the skull,the doctor will show you where exactly,roth
349,350,i want you to write down all your questions so you can go over everything with him on monday,he put his hand to the base of his skull and feeling nothing unusual there smiled again,roth
351,352,everybody s battle is different and the battle never ends,he was remembering how i had nearly died of a burst appendix and peritonitis in,roth
353,354,then he was back in recalling my hernia operation at age he had taken me to see the family doctor after i had been in distress on a sunday drive with the family,it was the second time in a month we had been to the doctor about my discomfort,roth
355,356,i told the doctor i insisted this not a complainer there must be something wrong and they told us there was nothing wrong but i insisted and insisted and eventually they found out i was right,i told dr,roth
357,358,ira he should rest in remember our doctor ira flax of course i do,i was nuts about him i said to him ira this is a frisky boy who loves to run and play ball and if there is something wrong with him i want it fixed i ll never forget him coming down those stairs in the beth israel hospital the night that you were born,roth
359,360,three in the morning,the main staircase of the hospital,roth
361,362,ira was in his white gown,i said to him what is it ira phyllis or philip and he said it s philip herman,roth
363,364,another boy i ll never forget that,and my brother charlie dying in my arms,roth
365,366,such a handsome man all that energy four children and he died in my arms my older brother i worshiped,and my milton my brother milton no i said milton died the year before i was born,roth
367,368,that s how i got my middle name milton he said nineteen years old a brilliant student the shining light of the family his senior year at newark college of engineering on and on remembering the illnesses the operations the fevers the transfusions the recoveries the comas the vigils the deaths the mind in its habitual way working to detach him from the agonizing isolation of a man at the edge of oblivion and to connect his brain tumor to a larger history to place his suffering in a context where he was no longer someone alone with an affliction peculiarly and horribly his own but a member of a clan whose trials he knew and accepted and had no choice but to share,in this way did he manage to domesticate his terror and eat his lunch and that night as he reported to me the next morning on the telephone to get six continuous hours of sleep before waking in a sweat at am,roth
369,370,i was not so lucky,i couldn t find any context to diminish my forebodings,roth
371,372,the thought of his undergoing an operation as awful as that at the age of eightysix was unbearable,and if he even made it successfully through the surgery the prospect of the if something should go wrong during the surgery i couldn t sleep for six continuous minutes and early the next morning after sitting up in bed for several hours trying to read i phoned my friend c h huvelle who until his retirement from practice a few years back had as our family doctor in connecticut helped me through some physical difficulties of my own,roth
373,374,i told ch,about the brain tumor and the proposed operation,roth
375,376,look he said after hearing me out this is the way it stacks up,if he dies on the table well he will have died at eightysix which isn t the worst age to die at,roth
377,378,if he lives and the operation is a success which the guy says happens seventyfive percent of the time good,the only bad result as far as i see it is if he suffers a further neurological deficit as a result of the surgery,roth
379,380,the brain surgeon assures me that it s going to get worse in a very short time,just remember you can t prevent your father from dying and you may not be able to prevent him from suffering,roth
381,382,i ve seen hundreds of people go through this with their parents,you were spared it with your mother and she was spared it too,roth
383,384,zombie word i don t suppose i d heard since as children my brother and i used to go to see horror movies at the rex theater in conjuring up the most hideous medical scenarios and when i got back to the hotel as disconcerted as when i d left for the park i phoned to ask if he wanted to go for a ride,i kept imagining him in the apartment sitting in the corner of the sofa with the radio off and the shades when i did it simply made no sense for me to be strolling around new york or having lunch with a friend or sitting in a movie theater in order to forget for a few hours my father and that massive tumor of his over there together in elizabeth keeping each other company,roth
385,386,no he didn t want to go for a ride,but it was a beautiful spring day,roth
387,388,we could drive up to the orange mountains,we could go to grunings for lunch,roth
389,390,no he was better off at home,i said i would come over and we could take a walk,roth
391,392,he didn t want to go for a walk,i said i d buy some lox and bagels and drive over and have lunch with him and lil at the apartment,roth
393,394,was lil around,she was upstairs,roth
395,396,well tell her to come down and we ll have lunch together,it wasn t necessary,roth
397,398,maybe not for you i thought but it is for me and so i went out and bought lox bagels and cream cheese in a sixth avenue deli and then got the car and drove over to jersey,this time when i left the turnpike i concentrated on my driving to be sure that i didn t mistakenly get onto the road to the cemetery,roth
399,400,there was nothing to be gained by making a habit of that though i wasn t sorry that the day before i had taken the wrong turn,i couldn t have explained what good it had hadn t been a comfort or consolation if anything it had only confirmed my sense of his i was still glad that i had wound up there,roth
401,402,i wondered if my satisfaction didn t come down to the fact that the cemetery visit was narratively right paradoxically it had the feel of an event not entirely random and unpredictable and in that way at least offered a sort of strange relief from the impact of all that was frighteningly unforeseen,when i got there he was sitting as i had imagined alone on the sofa pitifully dejectedlooking,roth
403,404,the shades were drawn the radio music wasn t on and it appeared as though he hadn t even bothered to borrow yesterday s newspaper from one of his spendthrift neighbors,as i began to unpack the food i d brought he told me he wasn t hungry when i suggested that instead of eating right away we go out and take a walk he made a noise to indicate that he didn t want to,roth
405,406,where s lil i asked turning on a lamp at about eleven in the morning,i hoped they hadn t argued though i wouldn t have put it past him even at the time of his greatest need to go to work first thing on one or more of those many failings of hers that it had become his mission to eradicate,roth
407,408,she ate too much and was overweight she was cheap and wouldn t part with a dime she talked for hours on the phone with a sister of hers he couldn t stand she was always running this flea market to buy crap to that flea market to buy crap she took stupid risks with money he told her to stick into cds she didn t drive a car to his satisfaction,the list was long maybe even endless though of course at the beginning of their affair it had been for him as it is for all of us,roth
409,410,in and when he was off for his second and third winters as a widower in florida and she was still holding down her job in new jersey he had sent her a letter daily by and large a miscellany of little news bulletins about his waking hours composed in fragments over the course of the day,they were sprightly playful conspicuously loving shyly sexual unashamedly romantic letters embellished on occasion with upbeat doggerel both plagiarized and invented and adorned with stickfigure drawings of the two of them holding hands hugging and kissing or lying sidebyside in bed letters beginning sweet lilums and hello baby and dearest dear lil a continus stream as he at once proudly and a little selfmockingly described his correspondence to her of preaching philosuphy poems and art and tenderness,roth
411,412,i hope he wrote that winter is not harsh please take care going to and from work,without you this is another dull day,roth
413,414,here s my hand to hold real tight,and directly beneath a third grader s drawing of a hand,roth
415,416,think of you all day,i saw the smile on your pretty face when i called also the happiness in your voice well i must confess i smiled also,roth
417,418,the song the man is singing on the radio is are you lonsome tonight are you,i was,roth
419,420,into a single ordinary envelope he stuffed for her xeroxed copies of the first pages of the sheet music for love somebody love makes the world go round love is a manysplendored thing love and where do i begin from the movie love story,in precise detail he reported daily what he d eaten at what time he d swum and for how long where he d walked and how far whom he d played cards and kibitzed with exactly how many days were left before he saw her again even what he wore,roth
421,422,all dressed in white shoes socks trousers and shirt,as for a jacket lets see,roth
423,424,either the red and white one you say you don t care for or the black and white,well sweety i don t have you here to make the choice so will have to make the momentous decision myselve,roth
425,426,tried them both on the red and white one looks best on me,but decided on the other because i will be sitting most of the time and it is a lighter weight so that s that,roth
427,428,several times each week he begged her to believe apparently she didn t that the wealthy charming widows he d met his first winter in florida were now only platonic friends he saw very occasionally which was only a shade away from the truth that she and she alone was his pretty lady and too he kept her briefed on the daybyday struggle to broaden bill weber s horizons,bill is a strictly jewish meat and potatoes man can t even get him to go out for chinese,roth
429,430,finally convinced bill to go out for chinese food,there was absolutely nothing he didn t want to tell her then,roth
431,432,she had been perfect then even her flaws were beautiful,yes back then her physical proportions were characterized in rather more flattering terms than he would have used to describe them now,roth
433,434,she s like that painter he had told me you know who i mean,i hadn t met lil as yet but i took a guess,roth
435,436,rubens that s the one he said,well zaftig is nice too i said,roth
437,438,philip he said shyly i m doing things i haven t done since i was a boy we should all be so lucky i told him,but it wasn t her weight that had determined lil s fate so much as her docility a patient bovine tolerance or for all i know a saintly genius for being poked and prodded about her shortcomings,roth
439,440,there were times to be sure when the criticism became too much even for her and after a bitter flareup that took him completely by surprise she retreated upstairs and didn t return for a day or even two,then thinking to himself hell i ve got hundreds of women i don t need her he got on the phone to one or another of the widows down in bal harbour,roth
441,442,there was also isabel berkowitz up at the jewish federation plaza who had sometimes come to visit him when lil was off on one of her biannual package tours with her sister and whom he spoke with on the phone every week and whenever he and lil were on the outs,but the fact was that these women he phoned were wealthier and more worldly than lil women accustomed as the widows of successful businessmen to living somewhat more expansively than she ever had and capable of inspiring in my father rather more social short women less malleable than the woman he had settled on and ones whose faults he might not necessarily have got away with correcting a hundred times a day,roth
443,444,lil until her my father had talked her into somewhat against her better worked in the office of an auto supply house that happened to be owned by one of my boyhood friends lenny lonoff whose family had lived just across the street from us when we were grade school kids,lil had moved into my father s apartment building shortly after the death of her a year after the death of my lived there with one of her two stepsons kenny whose financial acumen didn t entirely meet my father s standards,roth
445,446,not only didn t my father approve of how kenny went about his business but he didn t like the way lenny lonoff ran the auto supply house either,when he told lil as much instead of retorting that he didn t know what he was talking about or that she didn t need his opinion she sat and she listened and didn t talk back and as i see it this forbearance may perhaps have had more to do with what seduced him than did the rubenesque amplitude that he soon came to see as a result of her continuing to eat much too much despite his relentless upbraiding of her meal by meal course by course helping by helping,roth
447,448,eating was her only revenge and like the tumor it was something he could not stop no matter how he railed against it,he could never understand that a capacity for renunciation and iron selfdiscipline like his own was extraordinary and not an endowment shared by all,roth
449,450,he figured if a man with all his handicaps and limitations had it in him then anybody did,all that was required was if willpower grew on trees,roth
451,452,his unswerving dutifulness toward those for whom he was responsible seemed to compel him to respond to what he perceived as their failings as viscerally as he did to what he not necessarily be their needs,and because his was a peremptory personality and because buried deep inside him was an unalloyed nugget of prehistoric ignorance as well he had no idea just how unproductive how maddening even at times how cruel his admonishing could be,roth
453,454,he would have told you that you can lead a horse to water and you can make him just hock him and hock him and hock him until he comes to his senses and does it,hock a yiddishism that in this context means to badger to bludgeon to hammer with warnings and edicts and short to drill a hole in somebody s head with words,roth
455,456,after he and lil got to west palm beach one december my father wrote a letter to my brother covering both sides of two sheets of white tablet paper with his laborious scrawl,sandy had cautioned him for the sake of domestic peace to try to be a little less critical of lil particularly about her eating once they were alone together in florida,roth
457,458,sandy added that he might want to take it easy too on jonathan sandy s younger son who was just then beginning to make the first real money of his life as a sales rep for kodak and whom my father in weekly phone calls and in letters was advising with the usual relentlessness to save and not spend,people who care and those that dont people who do and people who procrastinate and never do or help,roth
459,460,i came home from the office and did not feel well you and phil were very young,mother made dinner,roth
461,462,i did not sit down to eat instead i went into the liveing room,within the hour dr,roth
463,464,weiss was in the house mother called him,this was the scenario he asked me what was wrong,roth
465,466,i told him i had a pain over my heart after examination he told me he could not detect anything wrong with me,he then asked me what i did in excess,roth
467,468,i told him the only thing i could think of i smoke a lot he said how about cutting it down to three instead of a day,i said why not none and within the week my pain disappeared i cut out smokeing completely,roth
469,470,mother cared dr,weiss advised i listened there are many advisers in this world also people who care and do and people who listen in many instances lives are safed and there are also overindulgers those who smoke to much and drink to much take drugs and also are impulsive eaters,roth
471,472,in each case all these conditions can cause sickness and sometimes even worse,you wanted a house,roth
473,474,i went at once and got you the money to buy it,why,roth
475,476,because i cared,phil needed an operation for hernia i took him to the dr,roth
477,478,and he was operated on,same with mother after she suffered for years,roth
479,480,why because i cared and i am a doer,did her parents care i guess so but i felt the pain of both and did i did not procrastinate,roth
481,482,i tell jon and hock him,i use all kind of cliches like a fool and his money are soon parted a penny saved is a penny earned someday there will be an old man dependent on you,roth
483,484,and when he asked who i tell him its you,etc i dont tell him once i keep telling or hocking why because he forgets like a compulsive drinker or drug taker etc,roth
485,486,why do i continue hocking,i realize its a pain in the ass but if its people i care for i will try to cure even if they object or wont themselves i including myselve,roth
487,488,i have many battles with my concience but i fight my wronge thoughts,i care for people in my way,roth
489,490,please excuse the spelling and writing,she s never around anyway so what difference does it make,roth
491,492,she runs here she runs there,when she was sick i took care of her i waited on her hand and foot,roth
493,494,the hell with her,let her go,roth
495,496,i m fine,i never argue,roth
497,498,if i tell her something i only tell it to her for her own good,do as i say i told him,roth
499,500,i am fiftyfive he is almost eightyseven and the year is do as i say i tell he does it,the end of one era the dawn of another,roth
501,502,while he went to the closet and put on a bright red sweater and his white adidas i phoned lil and asked if she d like to take a walk with us,your father s going for a walk she said,roth
503,504,i don t mean to criticize but that s the truth philip,the three of us walked together to the drugstore three blocks away past the old apartment buildings and the new condominiums that were going up where the last of elizabeth s opulent victorian houses had once stood,roth
505,506,it was the same walk on which my mother had overextended herself on the day she died,lil held him by one arm and i by the other since walking had become very uncertain for him because of his poor vision,roth
507,508,only a few months earlier he had been patiently waiting for the cataract on his good eye to ripen so that it could be removed,now instead of looking forward to the minor surgery that would restore his vision and with confidently robust independence he was contemplating an operation on his head that could kill him,roth
509,510,as we walked he began to reminisce in a very rambling way,my memory is no good anymore he explained,roth
511,512,but that wasn t exactly true,the sequence was often random and the focus sometimes blurry but then the logic of his recollections could always be a little elusive even in the best of times,roth
513,514,he certainly had no difficulty remembering the names of people dead now twenty thirty and forty years or where they had lived to whom they were related and what they had said to him or he to them on occasions not necessarily that remarkable,through my father s mother s line we had belonged to a vast family network that had eventually organized into a family association in at the outbreak of the european war,roth
515,516,while i was growing up the association had consisted of some eighty families in and around newark and some seventy families in and around boston,there was an annual convention and an annual summer outing a family newspaper that was printed quarterly a family song a family seal and family stationery a current roster of names and addresses of every family member was sent out to everyone each year a happy day fund looked after the ill and the convalescing and an education fund assisted children of the family with their college tuition,roth
517,518,in herman roth had become the fifth family member and the second of his brothers to be elected president,his first vice president had been harold chaban of roxbury massachusetts,roth
519,520,harold chaban was the son of max chaban and ida s uncle was uncle sam flaschner the family pioneer in america,his second vice president was herman goldstein who lived in new york,roth
521,522,goldstein was a hatter like sender roth loved to play cards with liebowitz and had married bertha the niece who had lived with the family on rutgers street when she came over with her sister celia from the old country in,his assistant treasurer had been his wife assistant secretary had been his sisterinlaw byrdine bernie s wife his assistant historian had been his younger sister betty,roth
523,524,all this was recounted to lil and me as we began our walk down north broad street,our family association he said back in those years was one of the largest and strongest associations of its kind in the united states it was the very tone in which he used to tell me as a boy that metropolitan life was the largest financial institution in the world we may have been ordinary people but our affiliations were not without grandeur,roth
525,526,out of nowhere he said used to be only jews around this part of elizabeth when mother and i moved from newark,not when she was growing up here of course,roth
527,528,it was irishmen then,all catholics,roth
529,530,no more,spanish korean chinese black,roth
531,532,how much did he get,six thousand dollars that s what he got for it,roth
533,534,the italian paid him in nickels dimes and quarters,millie was one of my mother s two younger sisters she had died at seventyeight only a few months earlier and by pointing to her building he had been pointing not to where she used to live but to where she who no longer lived lived no longer,roth
535,536,she and joe were buried on one side of my mother and my father s plot was on the other side,that s where millie lived now,roth
537,538,my father he said as we approached the drugstore to which my mother had taken the last long walk of her life my father had to beat my older brother ed to prevent him from marrying a worldly woman,his big hands and his broken nose and his rough argumentative nature would thrill me for an hour or two and i loved him but i was always glad at the end of a day s outing that he was my cousin florence s father,roth
539,540,you never told me that i said,saved him,roth
541,542,i don t remember why he told it but it was at dinner near the end of the meal and i had jumped up from the table in a rage and then bolted from the room when i d heard him conclude they don t have that kind of discipline anymore my mother had come into my bedroom to try to get me to go back to eat my dessert she had begged me to forgive him for whatever he had said that offended me so,please dear do it for me,roth
543,544,your father is not an educated man,but i had been adamant and refused to return to spoon down jello across the table from somebody who considered beating the love for a woman out of a twentythreeyearold one as pigheaded as my uncle praiseworthy form of discipline,roth
545,546,no doubt he had forgotten that incident and so actually had i until the moment thirtynine years later when for some obscure reason he had chosen to tell this story to me again,but there was no rage now against the storyteller,roth
547,548,my brother bernie he should rest in peace you know what he said to me when i told him not to marry byrdine bloch,of course i was proved right because after twenty years of marriage and two beautiful children he wound up getting that terrible divorce that tore the family apart,roth
549,550,but when i cautioned him about byrdine when i told him bernie she looks old enough to be your that really what you want you know what he said to me an older brother who was trying only to warn him,that,roth
551,552,that must be,we were walking back now the way we d come,roth
553,554,he was silent for a while,in front of the brain stem,roth
555,556,i couldn t read them if i had i said,look it s that but that was what he couldn t forget and dreaded most,roth
557,558,you ll get them i said,i drove over again on sunday morning and he had a set of sherry glasses ready for me to take away each glass individually wrapped in a page of the previous week s sunday starledger and all of them wedged bulkily together in a shoebox,roth
559,560,he never used them he said he didn t need them and he wanted claire and me to enjoy them in the country,ever since my mother s death each time he came to stay with us in connecticut he had something with him in a paper bag or a shopping bag or in the little plaid valise that he carried alongside him during the threehour car ride with the local driver we sent down to elizabeth to get him,roth
561,562,unlike the sherry glasses it was usually a present for him and my mother from me or from claire and me that now years later he was returning as though what they had been given had only been on loan or left there in storage,here are those napkins what napkins from ireland ireland,roth
563,564,that would have been the year of my guggenheim,my then wife and i had stopped in ireland on the way home to walk around joyce s dublin,roth
565,566,there s a tablecloth too he added from spain,gaudí s barcelona,roth
567,568,or here are the place mats,i don t think mother used them twice,roth
569,570,for her they were special for company only here are the steak knives and here is the flower vase and here are the coffee mugs and in the beginning when i resisted explaining to him but they re yours they were gifts he would reply with no idea that there might be a grain of insult lurking in all this unburdening what the hell do i need them for,look at this clock,roth
571,572,a beautiful clock that somebody gave us,must have cost a fortune,roth
573,574,i had given it to my mother a little porcelain clock with a floral design of the kind she liked that i bought for her in an antique shop in budapest on my way home one spring from visiting friends in prague,but i took it back silently,roth
575,576,little by little i took everything back struck each time by how inconsequential to him was the sentimental the material things intended to betoken the love of those he most cherished,strange i would think to find that particular blank spot in a man on whom the claims of family were so emotionally maybe not strange at all how could mere keepsakes encapsulate for him the overpowering force of blood bonds,roth
577,578,item by item i took it all back like a welltrained refund clerk in a firstrate department store but wondering if perhaps what he was thinking while he wrapped these gifts in old newspaper and stuffed them in cartons of every description was that this way we wouldn t have too many of his possessions to bother about after the funeral,he could be a pitiless realist but i wasn t his offspring for nothing and i could be pretty realistic too,roth
579,580,this time instead of silently accepting the goods being returned i reminded him that i was still a transient in a new york hotel didn t know when i d next be in connecticut and would just as soon have him hold on to the glasses,take them he insisted,roth
581,582,now there was nothing for him but to be frightened again,i was sorry suddenly for not having let him have his way and just taken the damn things back to the hotel,roth
583,584,but i was getting frazzled too,i ve been like that all my life he said dropping unhappily onto his spot on the sofa,roth
585,586,at the age of eightysix with a massive tumor in his head better to continue wearing at either side of his bridle those blinders that had kept him pulling his load straight ahead all his life,i wouldn t worry about it i said,roth
587,588,it isn t as if you re only impulsive,you can be cautious and prudent too,roth
589,590,you oscillate,what are you thinking i asked,roth
591,592,i gave my tefillin away,back when my father was an overworked insurance man being a jew for him hadn t had much to do with formal worship and like most of the firstgeneration american fathers in our neighborhood he visited the nearby synagogue only on the high holidays and when it was necessary as a mourner,roth
593,594,and at home there were really no rituals he observed,since his retirement however and particularly in the last decade of my mother s life they had begun to attend services together mostly every friday night and though he still didn t go so far as to lay tefillin in the morning his judaism was more pointedly focused on the synagogue and the service and the rabbi than it had been at any time since his childhood,roth
595,596,the temple was a hundred or so yards down the road on a little side street off north broad in an old house that was rented by the small congregation of elderly local people who were barely able to meet the upkeep costs,to my perhaps because they couldn t afford anyone cantor wasn t even a jew but a bulgarian who worked for a new york auction house during the week and for this little conclave of elizabeth jews on their sabbath,roth
597,598,after the service was over he sometimes entertained them with songs from yentl and fiddler on the roof,my father loved the bulgarian s deep voice and considered him a buddy he also thought highly of the yeshiva student who came over from new york to lead their services on the weekend a twentythreeyearold whom my father called rabbi most respectfully and spoke of as something of a sage,roth
599,600,however humble their manifestations these yearnings for a formalized religion in his old age were inspired by something far from hypocrisy or conventional decorum in fact the consolation that he seemed to derive from going to synagogue sense of unity it bestowed on his long life and the communion with his own mother and father he told me he felt his getting rid of the tefillin one of the more enigmatic instances of his lifelong habit of relinquishing rather than saving the treasured objects of the past,given the link of sentiment that jewish belief now seemed to furnish between the isolation of old age and the striving populous life that was all but gone i could have imagined him instead of parting with his tefillin rediscovering in the mere contemplation of them something of their ancient fetishistic power,roth
601,602,but my imagining this old man meditatively fondling his longneglected tefillin was so much sentimental kitsch really a scene out of some jewish parody of wild strawberries,how my father actually disposed of the tefillin reveals an imagination altogether bolder and more mysterious inspired by a personalized symbolic mythology as eccentric as beckett s or gogol s,roth
603,604,who d you give the tefillin to i asked him,who,roth
605,606,you know the y he said to me,the y,roth
607,608,i took the tefillin in a paper bag,the locker room was empty i left them,roth
609,610,i m curious i finally said,how come you didn t go to the rabbi,roth
611,612,or was i wrong about that too,maybe he d never even thought of the rabbi as perhaps the shrug was meant to it was just revealed to him in a flash the knowledge that in that secret place where jewish men stood unashamedly naked before one another he could lay his tefillin to rest without worry the understanding that where his tefillin would come to no harm where they would not be profaned or desecrated where they might even be resanctified was in the midst of those familiar jewish bellies and balls,roth
613,614,perhaps what the act signified was not his shame before the young rabbiintraining but a declaration that the men s locker room at the local ymha was closer to the core of the judaism he lived by than the rabbi s study at the nothing would have been more artificial than going with the tefillin to the rabbi even if the rabbi had been a hundred with a beard down to the ground,yes the locker room of the y where they undressed they schvitzed they stank where as men among men familiar with every nook and cranny of their worndown old illshapen bodies they kibitzed and told their dirty jokes and where once upon a time they d made their was their temple and where they remained jews,roth
615,616,i didn t ask why he hadn t turned them over to me,i didn t ask why instead of giving back to me all those napkins and tablecloths and place mats he hadn t given me the tefillin instead,roth
617,618,i wouldn t have prayed with them but i might well have cherished them especially after his death,but how was he to know that,roth
619,620,he probably thought i would have scoffed at the very idea of his handing on his tefillin to and forty years earlier he would have been right,i didn t ask because i realized that to do so was truly to place the two of us back inside that corny scenario i couldn t seem to cut myself loose from,roth
621,622,somewhat improbably where his tefillin were concerned it was i whose imagination kept running to the predictably maudlin while his had the integrity of a genuinely anomalous talent compelled by the elemental feeling that can lend ritualistic intensity to even the goofiest act,well i said when it was clear that he had no more to tell me one of your pals there must have got a big surprise when he came up from the pool,roth
623,624,he must have thought a miracle had happened,there he had left his shower clogs in the bottom of his locker and lo and behold they d been turned into tefillin,roth
625,626,i carried my suitcases from the baggage place all the way to the taxi s how good i felt,and the next morning my first morning in florida i woke up and this had happened in my sleep yet again he was pushing the fallen cheek up with his fingertips to see if this time it would stay,roth
627,628,i look in the mirror i see my face and i knew my life would never be the same,why he hadn t thought to give seth or jonathan the tefillin was easier to understand than why he hadn t thought to pass them on to me,roth
629,630,my nephews raised in a secular ethos with no knowledge of judaism were jews in name alone my father like my mother adored them worried about them praised them lavished on them gifts of a good deal more advice than they wished to he knew better than to expect them to know what the tefillin were let alone to want to own them,as for my brother my father probably imagined that sandy would have been as unreceptive as i to such a bequest though my guess is that sandy might have been touched by that memento not because of its religious significance but as a solid piece of our past as something that he remembered as i did seeing neatly stored for years and years in a velvet bag in a drawer of the dining room breakfront in the apartment where we had grown up,roth
631,632,but our father being our father couldn t have been expected to understand that,he understood like the rest of us only what he understood though that he understood fiercely,roth
633,634,i could no longer enter my father s bedroom without remembering the night just after my mother s after i had arrived from london that afternoon i had slept with him in his double bed,sandy and helen had gone to sleep at sandy s suburban house in englewood cliffs where seth and jon now young working men were still living but which sandy planned to sell shortly since his job had already relocated him in chicago,roth
635,636,in may at seventynine my father was in excellent health and impressively vigorous but twentyfour hours after his wife died in that seafood restaurant he looked almost as bad as he did now disfigured by the tumor,that first night together before bed i had given him milligrams of valium and a glass of warm milk to wash the tablet down,roth
637,638,he disapproved of tranquilizers and sleeping pills criticized vehemently anyone who relied on of on willpower the way he beginning that night and for the next few weeks he accepted the valium without any questions when i said it would help him to sleep though later perhaps to ease his conscience he referred to the drug he d taken as dramamine,we took turns in the bathroom and then in our pajamas we lay down side by side in the bed where he had slept with my mother two nights before the only bed in the apartment,roth
639,640,after turning off the light i reached out and took his hand and held it as you would the hand of a child who is frightened of the dark,he sobbed for a minute or i heard the broken heavy breathing of someone very deeply asleep and i turned over to try to get some rest myself,roth
641,642,thirty minutes later having taken no valium i was lying there wide awake when on the night table beside me the phone rang,i grabbed it so that my father s sleep wouldn t be disturbed and heard someone laughing at the other end,roth
643,644,who is this i asked but the answer was more crazy laughter,i hung up uncertain whether the call was a fluke wrong number or deliberate the work of some ghoul who followed the obituary pages in the local paper where my mother s death had been reported that morning and then phoned the families of the dead at night to get his kicks,roth
645,646,when the phone rang again less than a minute luminescent clock radio still showed knew it was no innocent wrong number,there again was the vicious laugh of one who has triumphed over an enemy the gleeful sadism of a victorious avenger,roth
647,648,after putting down the receiver i got out of bed and ran to the living room extension to take the receiver there off the hook before the phone rang a third time,i left it like that until around six the next morning when i got up and stole back into the living room to replace it so that my father wouldn t ask any questions,roth
649,650,i was in the bathroom when it rang around seven,my father answered,roth
651,652,when i came out and asked who had phoned so early he said angrily no one but it was clear enough what had happened,who was it i repeated and this time he described the laughing he d heard,roth
653,654,sounds like some screwball i told him without mentioning the calls i d taken the night before,it s wilkins he replied,roth
655,656,who s wilkins from across the street how do you know it s him i know all right what s he got against you i asked,he s a fascist dog,roth
657,658,a real jewhater,he lives alone,roth
659,660,not a friend in the world,just that mutt,roth
661,662,loves only mr,raygun and plastic nancy and that filthy mutt of his,roth
663,664,put raygun stickers all over the laundry room,our laundry room,roth
665,666,doesn t comes over here and does it so you told him not to i saw them and sure i told him not to,and the next day he puts up more,roth
667,668,when i saw what he d done i tore em down,i phoned him,roth
669,670,i told him that wasn t what this laundry room was for,it was for people to wash their clothes in peace and not for political campaigning what else did you tell him i told him what i thought of mr,roth
671,672,raygun,i told him in case he hadn t heard just what jews have suffered for two thousand years you re sure it s him it s wilkins all right,roth
673,674,i ll get him he said half to himself i ll get the son of a bitch dad don t the sound of it they got him,you know what a punishment it is for a man to laugh at somebody else s grief,roth
675,676,forget him,the laughing began as soon as i picked it up,roth
677,678,i listened for a long time with the phone held tightly to my ear,and then when the caller had neither stopped laughing nor hung up i said my best by cupping the mouthpiece not to wake my wilkins pull this shit one more time once more and i will be over at your door with my ax,roth
679,680,i ve got a big ax wilkins and i know where you live,i will beat your door down with my ax and then i am going to come in and split you up the middle like a log,roth
681,682,do you have a dog by any chance,i m going to turn your doggy into sausage wilkins,roth
683,684,with just my ax to help me i will then shove him up your ass and down your throat until you and fido are one,in the the mahogany bedroom suite no longer gleamed with polish as it had when my mother was in charge of the housekeeping where instead you could now initial the dust coating the upper father showed me in the middle of the top bureau drawer the little metal box where he kept his will his insurance policy and his savings books,roth
685,686,there was also a record of his cds and municipals,all my papers he said,roth
687,688,i did what you told me he said,flipping through the savings books i saw that the savings added up to about fifty thousand dollars the cds and municipals came to another thirty too were to be left to my brother,roth
689,690,the tenthousanddollar insurance policy goes to you he said,when i was visiting him in florida some two or three years after my mother s death the subject of his will had come up and i had told him to leave all his money to sandy to split as he wished between his two kids and himself,roth
691,692,i told him that i didn t need any money and that what seth and jonathan got could make a big difference to them if the money was divided two ways or three at the most,i had meant it when i said it i had confirmed it in a letter to him afterward and i hadn t thought about his will since,roth
693,694,but now with his death anything but remote being told by him that he had gone ahead and on the basis of my request substantially eliminated me as one of his heirs elicited an unforeseen response i felt the fact that his eliminating me from the will had been my own doing did not at all mitigate this feeling of having been cast out by him,i had made a generous gesture that was also i suppose of a piece with the assertions of equality and selfreliance that i had been making to my father since early adolescence,roth
695,696,admittedly it was also a characteristic attempt to take the moral high ground within the family to define myself in my fifties as i had in college and graduate school and later as a young writer as a son to whom material considerations were largely i felt crushed for having done it naive and foolish and crushed,to my great dismay standing with him over his last will and testament i discovered that i wanted my share of the financial surplus that against all odds had been accumulated over a lifetime by this obdurate resolute father of mine,roth
697,698,i wanted the money because it was his money and i was his son and i had a right to my share and i wanted it because it was if not an authentic chunk of his hardworking hide something like the embodiment of all that he had overcome or outlasted,it was what he had to give me it was what he had wanted to give me it was due me by custom and tradition and why couldn t i have kept my mouth shut and allowed what was only natural to prevail,roth
699,700,didn t i think i deserved it,did i consider my brother and his children more deserving inheritors than i perhaps because my brother by having given him grandchildren was more legitimately a father s heir than was the son who had been childless,roth
701,702,was i a younger brother who suddenly had become unable to assert his claim against the seniority of someone who had been there first,or to the contrary was i a younger brother who felt that he had encroached too much upon an older brother s prerogatives already,roth
703,704,just where had this impulse to cast off my right of inheritance come from and how could it have so easily overwhelmed expectations that i now belatedly discovered a son was entitled to have,but this had happened to me more than once in my life i had refused to allow convention to determine my conduct only to learn after i d gone my own way that my bedrock feelings were sometimes more conventional than my sense of unswerving moral imperative,roth
705,706,during the walk we took that afternoon in which i steered my father very slowly twice around the block i was not able to tell him however much i wanted however efficaciously humbling a confession of error might have i would like him to reassign to me the share of his estate that he had originally bequeathed to me in his will,for one thing because several years back my brother had had to provide his signature to gain access to the joint savings accounts he already knew of the changes and it did not seem worth even the thirty or forty thousand dollars to establish the conditions for a family feud or the eruption of poisonous feeling that is notoriously associated with the lastminute adjustment of an inheritance,roth
707,708,and there was my you like the hubris,in short for something like the reasons that had probably contributed to my telling him to leave the money to others in the first place i now found myself unable to renounce my instructions,roth
709,710,so much for learning from one s mistakes,let it be i thought,roth
711,712,but i then discovered myself unable to ask for that,not directly anyhow,roth
713,714,selfreliant to the last,independent to the end,roth
715,716,the son perpetually protesting his autonomy,i don t need anything,roth
717,718,tell me about grandpa s shaving mug i said,i was looking at it in your bathroom,roth
719,720,where was his barbershop,bank street,roth
721,722,below wallace place where the german hospital used to be on the corner of wallace place and bank street,there was a barber on bank street and when i was a little boy we used to go around and get my hair cut and my father would get a shave,roth
723,724,the mug had s,that s a good question,roth
725,726,let me remember,i don t think i did,roth
727,728,no,i didn t,roth
729,730,i took it from my brother ed,yes,roth
731,732,when we moved from rutgers street pop took it with him to hunterdon street and went to the barber on johnson avenue and avon avenue and then ed took it after pop died and i took it from him,i think it was the only thing that was ever left to me,roth
733,734,and it wasn t even left to me,on via giulia in that tiny barbershop,roth
735,736,that may have been the best of that whole year for me i said thinking of the marital battles that erupted daily in the small apartment around the corner from via giulia on via di sant eligio that i shared unhappily with an unhappy wife when we were living in italy on my thirtytwohundreddollar guggenheim,i d go down the street for a shave in the afternoon after i d finished writing,roth
737,738,my big luxury,the barber was guglielmo,roth
739,740,he wanted to talk all the time about caryl chessman,he prided himself on his english,roth
741,742,every time i came in happy birthday maestro fourth of july hot towels big shaving brush straightedge razor slapped silly with witch hazel to top it off and all for the equivalent of about fifteen cents,i said,roth
743,744,cost a quarter,there would be colored families he now told me still paying premiums twenty thirty years after the death of the insured,roth
745,746,three cents a week,that s what we collected how come they kept paying they never said anything to the agent,roth
747,748,somebody died and they never mentioned it,the insurance man came round and they paid him amazing i said though it was by no means the first time that i was hearing his stories of the eerie evenings collecting pennies from the poorest of newark s poor stories from thirtyeight years with the metropolitan with bill and abe and sam and j m cohen all of them as he reminded me several times long gone,roth
749,750,and of the few friends alive there wasn t much good news to report either,louie chesler is in a hospital pissing blood,roth
751,752,ida singer is almost blind,milton singer can t walk he s in a wheelchair,roth
753,754,dick turro has cancer poor guy,bill weber doesn t even know who i am when i call up,roth
755,756,herman herman who,the next day i drove to elizabeth to pick my father up and take him over to university hospital on springfield avenue in newark he was to consult there about an operation with the brain surgeon dr,roth
757,758,meyerson,lil and he were immediately at loggerheads when i asked the best way to get to meyerson s office,roth
759,760,it turned out that lil was talking about how to get to meyerson s office in millburn where she had gone with my father the first time he d been to see meyerson and he was talking about how to drive to meyerson s hospital office where unknown to lil this second appointment had been scheduled,in the car he managed to keep the disagreement simmering for some time after the confusion had been resolved,roth
761,762,he only quieted down about it when i turned up from elizabeth avenue toward bergen street and began to drive through the most desolate streets of black newark,what in my childhood had been the busy shopping thoroughfares of a lowermiddleclass mostly jewish neighborhood were now almost entirely burned out or boarded up or torn down,roth
763,764,the only ones about seemed to be unemployed black any rate black men standing together on the street corners seemingly with nothing to do,it was not a scene conducive to alleviating the gloom of three people on their way to consult with a brain surgeon and yet the rest of the way to the hospital my father forgot the encounter awaiting him there and instead reminisced in his random fashion about who had lived and worked where when he was a boy before the first world war and on these streets immigrant jews and their families were doing what they could to survive and flourish,roth
765,766,mr,tibor lived there,roth
767,768,i suppose he was a hungarian,he made my birthday suit and he made the pants too short,roth
769,770,the suit was useless,that s where al schorr s family lived,roth
771,772,my god that s still standing,rasping like that and deep,roth
773,774,had it when he was a little kid,al was thrown out of his class,roth
775,776,and so he came to my class and i made him treasurer class treasurer,i was the president,roth
777,778,well my father said al was a great guy,he didn t do it with a gun,roth
779,780,he did it with a laugh,he did everything with a laugh,roth
781,782,he worked with me until we fired him,i got him in the insurance business,roth
783,784,every job al ever had i got him,but he was stealing money and he says hey he says hey they re after me herman the police are after me well i says here s five dollars go to the sweat baths in new york and i gave him five dollars and he went to new york,roth
785,786,and he come back then he paid the company off and i got him a job with louie chesler,he sold,roth
787,788,i told him if he ever stole from louie i said i d shoot him,he worked for the shuberts in newark,roth
789,790,the theater,he used to pick the tickets that the people would tear in half off the ground,roth
791,792,he would put them together put em in a box and steal the money,his mother had to pay up i don t know two three thousand dollars,roth
793,794,his teacher threw him out of his class that s how we became friends,he looked around the classroom the first day in eighth know what a pishka is he said to me suddenly interrupting his story,roth
795,796,of course i know,a collection box,roth
797,798,and so he came into my room and i sized him up and i made him treasurer,i was president,roth
799,800,thirteenth avenue school,when he had settled in behind his desk he looked across to where i was sitting and asked what questions i had,roth
801,802,i pointed to my father looking awfully glum in a chair between lil whom the doctor had called mrs,roth and meyerson s chief nurse who we were told customarily sat in on preoperative consultations,roth
803,804,my father has the questions i said,go ahead dad,roth
805,806,ask dr,he d written them in pencil laboriously laid them out in that artlessly sprawling yokel handwriting capitalizing most of the nouns but spelling all except one or two words correctly,roth
807,808,he d showed me the list before we left the house and i had thought i want this list,one he began,roth
809,810,what s the procedure he looked up at meyerson,turning it in his hand and pointing with a pencil he explained where the tumor was situated and where it was pressing into the brain,roth
811,812,he showed us on the back wall of the skull where he could cut through to go in to remove it,i hadn t believed you could do such a thing to a brain without inviting disaster,roth
813,814,and for all i knew you couldn t,what do you use to go in there my father asked,roth
815,816,the doctor s reply demonstrated his own quiet objectivity,two,roth
817,818,and now it was he who was mildly mordantly ironic,three he said returning to his list again,roth
819,820,you ll be pretty sick afterward,you ll have a high fever,roth
821,822,he didn t give out however but proceeded to his fourth question,eight to ten hours then five to six days and what would he be worth after that,roth
823,824,after the impoverished childhood and the limited education after the failure of the shoe store and of the frozenfood business after the struggle to gain a managerial role in the teeth of the metropolitan s jewish quotas after the premature deaths of so many loved morris charlie and milton in the and his young niece jeanette and his young nephew david and his beloved sisterinlaw ethel in the all that he had weathered and survived without bitterness or brokenness or despair wasn t eight to ten hours of brain surgery really asking too much,isn t there a limit,roth
825,826,the answer is yes yes absolutely yes to the thousandth was asking too much,to isn t there a limit the answer is no,roth
827,828,most of the operating time meyerson explained is spent getting in through the skull,it depends then on the kind of tumor i find,roth
829,830,in that area ninetyfive percent ninetyeight percent are benign,there isn t much bleeding generally,roth
831,832,five,and just when i had thought that i had the picture i realized that not by any means had i grasped as yet the awfulness of this thing,roth
833,834,this time we drove through the ruins of newark in silence,he had nothing more to ask his childhood recollections were spent he did not even have it in him to improve was only that final exchange in meyerson s office for all of us to think about and think about,roth
835,836,meyerson had agreed that we should now solicit a second neurosurgical opinion but assuming as he did that the second doctor confirmed his judgment and we decided to go ahead with surgery at university hospital he advised us to have it sooner rather than later and to set up a tentative appointment for the operation on the first open date in his calendar,it turned out to be the anniversary of my mother s death seven years earlier,roth
837,838,at the apartment lil went into the kitchenette to prepare some campbell s soup for lunch,my father went in after her to get the dishes to set the dining room table and i sat in the living room trying to envision how meyerson was going to lift my father s brain without damaging it,roth
839,840,there must be ways i thought,lil was apparently using the manual opener screwed to the wall beside the sink because i heard my father telling her hold the can from the bottom,roth
841,842,it isn t right,how to open a soup can,roth
843,844,what else is there to think about,what else is there that matters,roth
845,846,this is what s kept him going for eightysix years and what if anything is going to get him through now,after setting our three places at the table he returned to the kitchenette and stood next to her over the saucepan,roth
847,848,she kept insisting the soup wasn t hot yet and he kept insisting it had to didn t take all day to heat up a can of vegetable soup,this exchange was repeated four times until his that is the out and he pulled the pot off the burner and leaving lil emptyhanded at the stove came into the dining room and poured the soup into the bowls and onto the place mats and over the table,roth
849,850,maybe because of his bad eyes he didn t see the extent of the mess he d made,the soup was cold,roth
851,852,nobody said so,he probably didn t even notice,roth
853,854,halfway through the silent meal he said matteroffactly this is the last chapter but kept spooning soup into his lopsided mouth until his bowl was empty and his shirt looked as though he had been painting with the soup,as i was leaving to go back to new york he went into the bedroom and returned with a small package for me,roth
855,856,a couple of brown paper bags had been savagely twisted about to accommodate the contents and then bound together with varying lengths of scotch tape most of which were coiled up on themselves like strands of dna,but that evening after having been out alone for a bowl of pasta i couldn t eat and then watching the mets as though baseball were a game i couldn t fathom i found that i was afraid to try to go to sleep without talking to someone and being consoled if only by a presence at the other end of the line,roth
857,858,i phoned my friend joanna clark who i figured might still be awake,joanna was a pole who had married an american come to princeton to live succumbed to drink divorced collapsed recovered and probably of all my friends had endured the most torment over the course of her life,roth
859,860,she could also be funny about the two of us,i pollute you with fumes i shower you with murky stories i make foolish jokes in my broken english and really you only want to have a little eastern european chat,roth
861,862,well nothing comes free,some poles are crazykins and i am i believe at the very beginning of the war in september her father had been killed by german artillery,roth
863,864,i don t remember my father at all she had told me one evening when i d stopped off in princeton for dinner,i was on my regular trip up to new york from philadelphia where i was teaching at the university of pennsylvania,roth
865,866,in those years joanna was usually already halfdrunk when she picked me up in her car at the junction train station and her babble while gombrowicz witkiewicz schulz alarmingly mythomaniacal brilliantly eccentric terrifically informative and to me not unalluring,she was dour and sobersounding about her father however as we wove back along the road into princeton,roth
867,868,he was shot in the trench,defending warsaw,roth
869,870,in fact he was carried by his jewish lieutenant,he was in a trench and he got it,roth
871,872,he didn t die right away,he died in the hospital of a wound how old was he he was very young,roth
873,874,he was thirtyseven and so you have no recollection of him i was a baby,no none,roth
875,876,all i wanted was her fatherless courageous rejuvenated joanna just listening to me might provide whatever it was i now needed at eleventhirty at night to face putting my own father at eightysix through a tenhour operation five lifeless days in bed three or four months of convalescence and all of it with no real certainty that it would do him a damn bit of good,eightysix,roth
877,878,eightysix kept coming in like a knell,i suppose in phoning joanna i was conceding that even i knew you couldn t have a father forever,roth
879,880,she was still awake when i phoned up waiting for a call from one of her pigeons s how she referred to the recovering addicts she looked after,at a local recovery program whose meetings she attended regularly she d become surrogate mother to some five or six young girls trying to kick drugs,roth
881,882,the girl she was waiting to hear from was moving out on a deadbeat boyfriend who the night before when she d told him she was leaving had bloodied her nose with one punch,well i said i ve been involved in some unpleasantness myself,roth
883,884,he has a big brain tumor,the doctor says it s been growing anywhere from five to ten years,roth
885,886,they tell me he s going to be in desperate shape in a very short time,they re going to have to try to get it out,roth
887,888,no,but the alternative is to let it grow and take the consequences and that could be grotesque,roth
889,890,the problem is that for an eightysixyearold man even if he the doctor claims they survive three times out of recovery will be a nightmare,i don t mean in some unusual way i mean in his own mundane bullheaded way,roth
891,892,his strength amazes me,well i don t cry all the i seem to sit in this hotel and do absolutely nothing,roth
893,894,then i think why am i sitting here when he s over there and i drive to elizabeth and take him for a walk,tomorrow is going to be the first day that he s really alone,roth
895,896,but i don t have it in me to go over again,so there it is i said,roth
897,898,he s fought such a long the adjective that came to me was not one i d ever thought to associate with his efforts however much i d always respected his long long distinguished battle the word s utter aptness took me by surprise,the alternative is unacceptable,roth
899,900,he doesn t even have it as a fantasy solution,i was over there today to get him to the doctor,roth
901,902,i had to drive him across poor poor poor old newark,he knows every street corner,roth
903,904,where buildings are destroyed he remembers the buildings that were there,you mustn t forget s the inscription on his coat of arms,roth
905,906,to be alive to him is to be made of him if a man s not made of memory he s made of nothing,see those steps i was sitting on that stoop with al remember al borak,roth
907,908,he had the furniture was sitting there with al the day america went into the war,it was springtime april or may i forget,roth
909,910,there s where your greataunt had the candy store,that s where my brother morris had his first shoe store,roth
911,912,gee is that still there he says,on and on,roth
913,914,we passed his school thirteenth avenue school where he was the teacher s favorite,my teacher she loved me,roth
915,916,we get to the hospital and he says what a blessing for the city of newark when they built this hospital so he s thinking not about his tumor but about the city of newark,he s the bard of newark,roth
917,918,the best citizens,he hasn t given up europe entirely she said,roth
919,920,the europe in him is his survivorship,these are people who will never give up,roth
921,922,but they are better than europe too,there was gratitude in them and idealism,roth
923,924,did i ever tell you what happened when he was mugged a couple of years ago,it was the middle of the afternoon,roth
925,926,my father had been at the temple office helping them with mailing or something and he was coming home,the black kids prey on the elderly jews in his neighborhood even in broad daylight,roth
927,928,they bicycle in from newark he tells me take their money laugh and go home,get in the bushes he tells my father,roth
929,930,i m not getting in any bushes my father says,you can have whatever you want and you don t need that piece to get it,roth
931,932,you can put the piece away the kid lowers the gun and my father gives him his wallet,take all the money my father says but if the wallet s of no value to you i wouldn t mind it back the kid takes the money gives back the wallet and he runs,roth
933,934,and you know what my father does,he calls across the street how much did you get and the kid is counts it for him,roth
935,936,twentythree dollars the kid says,well he s not guilty your father,roth
937,938,of course he treats him like a son,he won t give in to it,roth
939,940,he got a lot of mileage out of never recognizing the differences among people,all my life i have been trying to tell him that people are different one from the other,roth
941,942,my mother understood this in a way that he didn t,couldn t,roth
943,944,this is what i used to long for in him some of her forbearance and tolerance this simple recognition that people are different and that the difference is legitimate,but he couldn t grasp it,roth
945,946,but he had his own particular jewish style of insisting on his absolutely totalistic notions of what is good and what is right and as a kid it really used to get me down,everybody has to do it exactly the same way,roth
947,948,it s in you too a certain relentlessness that you got from him,you ve forgiven him that relentlessness and that tactlessness that wanting to make everybody over in the same mold,roth
949,950,all children pay a price and the forgiveness entails forgiveness also for the price you paid,since my mother died i ve got awfully close to him,roth
951,952,the death of a parent it s horrible,when my mother died she said i had no idea that i would feel that way,roth
953,954,half or more of life goes,he is going to chop his head open pick his brain up and cut away inside his skull with a laser with a beam of i thought i know where people s weaknesses come from we all know that but where is the source of the strength,roth
955,956,i don t know,i m sure this is all very elementary but it s got me stumped tonight,roth
957,958,you don t need surreal art you know,this is surreal to me,roth
959,960,in london,at home,roth
961,962,she gets upset when i call,she s said she wants to come back to help but i told her to stay put and do what she has to do there,roth
963,964,in a way it s actually better alone moping about by myself rather than having her here to drag down too,i d just drive back from jersey and sit and stare at to sit and stare by myself,roth
965,966,it s better to be concentrated on what has to be done,though all the concentration isn t so wonderful either,roth
967,968,i can t read god knows i can t can t even watch a stupid baseball game,i absolutely can not think,roth
969,970,that s also your father she said laughing at me now,i clipped my toenails sitting at the edge of the first thing in days i d been able to concentrate on other than those words,roth
971,972,four words again very very basic stuff but that night after joanna had done me the favor of hearing me out it sounded like all the wisdom in the world to me,i didn t understand anything,roth
973,974,as i d driven back to manhattan that afternoon with my grandfather s shaving mug clutched in one hand certainly nothing could have been clearer to me than how little i knew,it wasn t that i hadn t understood that the connection to him was convoluted and i hadn t known was how deep deep can be,roth
975,976,i slept fitfully till four in the morning then i turned on the light got out of bed and looked at the pictures of his brain again understanding nothing about that either,had it been the mri of yorick s brain that hamlet had been looking at even he might have been speechless,roth
977,978,a few days later we got the second opinion and my father preferred it to the first,vallo benjamin a neurosurgeon at nyu hospital in manhattan had agreed to fit us in at the request of david krohn who had described him to me as worldclass benjamin was an authoritative worldly man of about my age a smartly dressed darkeyed foreigner virilely goodlooking in the forthright school of picasso whom he resembled,roth
979,980,he listened to the medical history my father recounted asked if he got headaches or dizzy spells then touched the point of a pin to the two sides of my father s face to determine how much feeling he d lost on the bad side,benjamin looked to be scrutinizing him very carefully as my father answered all the questions asked his own questions and waited to hear if a stay of execution might be granted and his sentence lifted leaving him free to feel as though he were forty again,roth
981,982,i feel like forty was something he d told everyone even on days when it wasn t true until just a few months back,benjamin stuck the mri pictures of the brain up on the lighted screen behind his desk and told me to come around and take a look at them with him,roth
983,984,my father sat docilely beside lil holding in his hand his piece of paper with the list of questions while the doctor speaking so softly that only i could hear traced a finger over the pictures to show me the extensiveness of the tumor,strictly speaking he said it wasn t a brain tumor,roth
985,986,probably it had begun as a tumor on a facial nerve and grown to where now it was not only pushing against the brain stem but extruding through the bone at the back of the nose,meyerson had estimated that it would take eight to ten hours to operate and had called the operation routine,roth
987,988,now i was told that it would more likely take thirteen or fourteen hours and that the operation involved working where all the arteries and nerves are massed tricky terrain the doctor said,are you telling me it s impossible i asked him,roth
989,990,not at all he snapped back as though i had impugned his expertise,his brotherinlaw had a tumor like this and they radiated it,roth
991,992,used radiation and it went away,i m not saying that would solve everything be permanent,roth
993,994,roth he replied very gently i don t know if radiation would be effective until i know the kind of tumor we re dealing with,to know that i need in addition to these pictures a cat scan to give us a picture of the skull as well as the situation with the brain,roth
995,996,i then need a biopsy of the tumor,the biopsy is done with a needle the doctor told him,roth
997,998,it s a procedure that takes no more than an hour,i would recommend that you come into the hospital overnight so that we can watch you afterward,roth
999,1000,my father s unembellished style and the fight that was obviously still in him despite his age and all he was up against seemed somewhat to beguile the sophisticated neurosurgeon and even to touch some chord of personal sympathy,several times in recounting the history of his illness my father had veered off into an anecdote out of his newark childhood some seventyfive years earlier a narrative whose subterranean message appeared to be that he had learned to be realistic on rutgers street and was prepared for whatever befell him now,roth
1001,1002,he and life went way way back together and he wanted benjamin to know that too,to each about standing up to the irish ruffians from down neck in newark or working after school in his cousin s blacksmith doctor listened with nearly as much curiosity as impatience and he kindly waited to steer him back to the business at hand until my father had illustrated his point,roth
1003,1004,then he explained to him in detail how the needle would be inserted up through the roof of the mouth the tissue removed from the tumor with the needle and so on step by step,and radiation my father asked again a little desperately this time,roth
1005,1006,the biopsy will determine if it is the kind of tumor that responds to radiation,the original request for a couple more years had in a matter of minutes been extended to three or four i noticed,roth
1007,1008,my father was obviously coming to trust and even to imbue with a certain divine might this doctor who was at once so much more patrician and potentlooking than haimisher heavyset dr,meyerson who had proposed to do rather more than stick a needle up through the roof of his mouth,roth
1009,1010,it occurred to me that if we were all to sit and talk together in benjamin s office for another day or two my father would eventually overcome his fear of calling down even worse misery upon himself by appearing sinfully greedy and proclaim to this doctor what had to be in his heart which was that he wanted not just three or four years more but to tackle the whole damn thing all over again i raised myself up out of the immigrant streets without even a high school education i never knuckled under never broke the law never lost my courage or said i quit i was a faithful husband a loyal american a proud jew i gave two wonderful boys every opportunity i myself never had and what i am demanding is only what i eightysix years,why he would ask him should a man die at all and of course he would have been right to ask,roth
1011,1012,it s a good question,you ll feel nothing,roth
1013,1014,you will have a general anesthetic,we found a table for us also was my nephew seth who lives in jersey city with his wife and who had driven lil and my father from elizabeth and was going to drive them back,roth
1015,1016,seth had sat out in the waiting room during the consultation and partly for his information but mainly to be sure that my father hadn t misunderstood in the cafeteria i went over everything again emphasizing that though the doctor had left open the possibility of the tumor being susceptible to treatment by radiation that wasn t the likely eventuality,i like this man my father said when i had finished,roth
1017,1018,i m impressed by this man,the other guy just wanted to go in and cut,roth
1019,1020,this man wants all the information first,i m impressed by him,roth
1021,1022,weren t you he asked lil,i m sure he s an excellent doctor,roth
1023,1024,and he said wait,what is he my father asked me,roth
1025,1026,there were crowds outside the elevator on the main floor and pushing through the busy hospital lobby i held him by one arm while seth took the other,i have to start living again my father suddenly told me,roth
1027,1028,i can t hole up in that apartment anymore,i have to go back to the y the cantor from the synagogue came to see i tell you,roth
1029,1030,two men from the synagogue and the cantor,they d heard about the tumor,roth
1031,1032,a reprieve i thought and let him enjoy it,enjoy it yourself i thought if only till the next decision has to be made tomorrow and so that night i managed to watch the mets game with some pleasure concentrating like any ordinary runofthemill escapist on darling s threehitter and mcreynolds s home run rather than on my father and the tumor that was still there inside his head despite the mets victory blindly massively there and that if left there would in the end be as merciless as a blind mass of anything on the march,roth
1033,1034,two years earlier on october i unfortunately had to be in london while the mets were playing houston in game five of the playoffs,it was elevenfifteen london time when i phoned him in elizabeth and my father was ecstatic,roth
1035,1036,i d got him to take an interest in the mets only that spring when he was laid low for about a month by a debilitating malaise that nobody could diagnose and that probably had had something to do with the brain tumor,his strength deserted him almost completely he had no appetite for food and sometimes when he got up to walk he listed from side to side,roth
1037,1038,i d flown back from london to find out what was wrong and during the weeks i d stayed on in new york i had tried to divert his attention from this unexplained illness by getting him interested in the mets who were on the way to winning the pennant,i would come over some evenings for dinner and watch the game with him and when i went out to a couple of games at shea stadium i d told him to keep his eyes open and see if he could spot me in the stands,roth
1039,1040,by the time i left his symptoms had all but disappeared and he was nearly fit again and also very much a a fan for the first time really since i was a small boy and he used to take my brother and me out to ruppert stadium in newark to see the old triplea newark bears play a sunday doubleheader against our rivals from across the marshes the jersey city giants,when i wound up in london during the playoffs i phoned him each night to find out about the games,roth
1041,1042,i loved his exuberant descriptions,mets won he told me as though it had been a triumph for him as well,roth
1043,1044,twelfth inning,a helluva game,roth
1045,1046,gooden against ryan,strawberry hit a home run,roth
1047,1048,then they tied it,slow down i said,roth
1049,1050,they won in the twelfth,backman hits a ball too hot for the third baseman,roth
1051,1052,couldn t hold on to it,he got on first,roth
1053,1054,then the pitcher for the houston astronauts threw a wild pitch to first and he went to second,so there was no sense pitching to hernandez and he put him on,roth
1055,1056,then carter came up,he is for twentytwo or twentythree,roth
1057,1058,and he hit the ball back up the middle backman scored and that was it,how long ago did it end i asked,roth
1059,1060,about half an hour ago,a hundred and twenty thousand bucks plus the honor my father said,roth
1061,1062,mets two houston three gentiles nothing,now they re going down to houston right,roth
1063,1064,they just have to win one he said,phil they ll beat him,roth
1065,1066,first of all he s pitching for the second time after three days rest,or is it four days rest,roth
1067,1068,i ll speak to you tomorrow,and congratulations on wiesel,roth
1069,1070,and laughing when i called the next night,well what happened i said,roth
1071,1072,it s still on,you wouldn t believe it,roth
1073,1074,i m watching it now,it s beautiful he said,roth
1075,1076,well i m going to sleep i said,it s eleventhirty here,roth
1077,1078,but at midnight after having brushed my teeth and gone to bed i got out of bed and came down to the kitchen to call him again,i wasn t just calling because of the mets,roth
1079,1080,what happened i asked him,phil,roth
1081,1082,i think dykstra got him around,and then this guy hit a home run in the houston bottom of the fourteenth,roth
1083,1084,and now it s the top of the fifteenth,he popped up,roth
1085,1086,well that isn t a strikeout,go ahead herm,roth
1087,1088,i m a rich man,pitch by pitch,roth
1089,1090,it s been an unbelievable game but it was three nothing going into the ninth,the mets had only got two hits,roth
1091,1092,you know something,it s almost time for the red sox to get started,roth
1093,1094,that s supposed to start at eight o clock and here it is seven already,i ll give you a ring tomorrow to see what happened,roth
1095,1096,you just get some sleep he said,at seven the next morning his london phoned to tell me the results,roth
1097,1098,you ve never seen anything like it,i knew you d be wondering,roth
1099,1100,they were down three in the ninth,they get three runs in the ninth,roth
1101,1102,they go ahead four three,for the mets,roth
1103,1104,the mets go ahead four three,then houston gets a home run ties it up four four,roth
1105,1106,in the sixteenth inning the mets get three runs,they go ahead seven four,roth
1107,1108,houston gets up,guy gets on base and the next guy gets a home run,roth
1109,1110,seven six,i m telling you,roth
1111,1112,after morosco gave up the runs in the sixteenth hernandez came out to the just read this in the you know what he said to him,our reprieve lasted about twentyfour hours,roth
1113,1114,then the brain tumor took charge again,for the next month and a half nothing happened and nothing was of us knew what exactly to do,roth
1115,1116,since the first neurosurgeon had said that the tumor would not respond to radiation and the second had indicated that the chances radiation would help were small the biopsy began to seem an ordeal that we had no business forcing on him particularly as i had learned by asking around that it could be very painful and given where the needle was to be blindly inserted not without some risk,and if the result was only to present us with the option we already operation that could leave him worse off rather than was gained by subjecting him to it,roth
1117,1118,to make things more difficult only a few days after our consultation dr,benjamin left america for over a month to lecture in europe and there was no way that i could air my doubts with him until his return on june,roth
1119,1120,he had given us the name of someone to whom he was willing to entrust the biopsy but though my father went back over to new york to see that time accompanied by my brother who had flown in from chicago for a week to be with him and to spell me a all felt there were too many unanswered questions to proceed before dr,benjamin s return if at all,roth
1121,1122,and my father was hardly equipped to make the decision to go ahead on his own,he d conducted himself gallantly with the two brain surgeons but now caught in the vise of their differing proposals he succumbed to a wild helplessness,roth
1123,1124,he began to say things to me that didn t make much sense and then for longer periods said nothing or suddenly unprovoked lashed out at lil so uncontrollably that even he was startled afterward by his vehemence and meekly apologized,apologizing to lil would not have seemed like an unfortunate development had it not signaled demoralization rather than remorse,roth
1125,1126,he repeated to me to my brother to everyone that he didn t want a biopsy or an operation through the back of his head or the roof of his he wanted was what he had wanted from the start to be able to see his food and to read his paper and as he put it to navigate on his own,why couldn t they just remove the cataract from his good eye and give him back his sight,roth
1127,1128,i found a draft of a letter to the ophthalmologist on the dining room table one day when i came over for lunch dear dr,krohn i want my sight back,roth
1129,1130,i want my eye fixed,that s what i want,roth
1131,1132,meyerson who had never struck me as a fool had warned us that things were going to get worse in a relatively short time unless something was done,meyerson had told us that to remove the tumor he would go in through the back of the skull and take eight to ten hours to get it out and benjamin had told us that to remove the tumor he would go up through an incision in the roof of the something like the route of the biopsy extract it in thirteen or fourteen hours and my father was telling me that the one prospect was as horrifying as the other and that submitting to either was unthinkable,roth
1133,1134,all i want is my sight back,listen to what he is saying,roth
1135,1136,he is telling you what he wants and it s very simple,he wants his eye fixed,roth
1137,1138,he s not a s made it through eightysix years on his own kind of wisdom so honor that wisdom and just give him what it is he wants but then in the next minute it would seem to me that by yielding to his unrealistic appraisal of the crisis i was only trying to evade the hard choice and so around again i went unconvinced that there was any reward commensurate with the risks involved in surgery yet conscious that if nothing was done in a relatively short time his condition could deteriorate horribly,one morning after my brother had flown back to chicago i made a call to palm beach to sandy kuvin a doctor cousin of ours,roth
1139,1140,over the years at my request he had been checking in on my father when my father was vacationing in florida and he had given us sensible advice about such health problems as had cropped up for my father down there,sandy was a couple of years older than i a father of three college kids and a vigorous supporter of israel who spent nearly half his working year at a medical research clinic in jerusalem for which he d raised the endowment and which was named for him,roth
1141,1142,i d made a tour of the place with one of his staff the last time i d been in jerusalem,we d all grown up in the same part of newark we d gone to the same high school in the forties and though he and i had only met up again i began visiting my father in florida each annual evening together at a local restaurant and our afternoons at his airy house on a palm beach inlet had been friendly and enjoyable each of us getting a kick out of seeing how far the other fellow had traveled from the halls of weequahic high,roth
1143,1144,after i explained the situation and described to him my indecision sandy said to me he s an old man s lived a long life and by now that tumor is growing pretty slowly,in ten years or so it s caused no more damage than the hearing loss in one ear and the facial paralysis on one side of his face,roth
1145,1146,maybe some of his headaches come from it and it may be that when he walks some of his uncertainty isn t just from the bad vision but from this thing pressing on the eighth nerve,maybe nothing he said and maybe everything,roth
1147,1148,if he wants his vision give him his vision and if he has it for as little as a month before he dies well he will at least have had what he wanted for a month,doc will you do me a favor,roth
1149,1150,will you telephone him,don t let on that we spoke,roth
1151,1152,call him out of the blue and let him tell you his story and then tell him what you told it s growing slowly and to forget it,because he s really headed for the bottom if something doesn t lift him soon,roth
1153,1154,chinning himself up on life again,you know what he said,roth
1155,1156,i told him what s happening and he said herman forget it,you ve had it for ten years and the pace that it s growing at is so slow that you can have it for another ten years before it does any more harm kuvin told me i could be killed by ten other things before the tumor gets any larger with something that sounded like real delight he enumerated for me the potential killers,roth
1157,1158,at their house,eleventhirty am,roth
1159,1160,he wants you to come to the wedding too,did that or did that not constitute a relatively short time,roth
1161,1162,if you go i ll go i said,phil i want my eyesight back,roth
1163,1164,i want dr,krohn to fix my eye,roth
1165,1166,i didn t see how in good conscience we could simply ignore the tumor until we were sure there was nothing to treat it other than the butchery that was unacceptable to all of us,i dreaded the thought that the needle that was to be stuck up through the roof of his mouth could damage something inside his skull but i allowed myself to be convinced by benjamin that dr,roth
1167,1168,persky who would perform the procedure was as skilled a practitioner as we could find,the super of his building drove my father and lil over to manhattan to the hospital where i met them and after an interminable bureaucratic delay got him registered and up to his room,roth
1169,1170,there he was given some supper to my surprise he was able to absorb himself completely in the meal,then lil left and i took him down to be interviewed by a young resident to whom he told the history of his illness as well as several brief anecdotes out of his childhood,roth
1171,1172,back in his room we got the pajamas out of his overnight case and after he had been to the bathroom i helped him into the bed,he was exhausted and his face with the patch off the blind eye on the drooping side looked dreadful,roth
1173,1174,yet he seemed if anything less dejected than he d been during the period when nothing was being done,there was a new ordeal to face and facing ordeals did not allow for hopelessness,roth
1175,1176,it called forth instead that amalgam of defiance and resignation with which he had learned to confront the humiliations of old age,at the registration desk downstairs he had been told that it cost a day to watch the tv set in the room and he had refused to pay it,roth
1177,1178,when i saw him on the bed staring at the ceiling with the one working eye i told him that i would pay for it,come on i said,roth
1179,1180,i don t allow myself the luxury,i m fine,roth
1181,1182,you want me to read you the news i asked,his teeth were lying on the bedside table where he d left them,roth
1183,1184,i put them into the plastic dish the hospital provided for dentures and capping it put the dish away in the table drawer,these teeth were new ones made for the lower right side of his mouth,roth
1185,1186,because of the facial disfigurement the dentist was having a lot of trouble fitting them precisely only two days earlier out taking a walk with me my father had yanked them from his these goddamn things,too many teeth then when he had them in his hand he didn t know what to do with them,roth
1187,1188,we were crossing north broad street at the time and the light was about to turn against us,here i d said give them to me and i took the dentures and stuck them in my pocket,roth
1189,1190,to my astonishment having them in my own hand was utterly satisfying,far from feeling squeamish or repelled as i continued along guiding him by one arm up onto the curb i was amused by the rightness of it as though we d now officially become partners in a comical though i d assumed the role of straight man to a clown whose illfitting false teeth invariably brought the house down a joke on a par with durante s nose or eddie cantor s eyes,roth
1191,1192,by taking the dentures slimy saliva and all and dumping them in my pocket i had quite inadvertently stepped across the divide of physical estrangement that not so unnaturally had opened up between us once i d stopped being a boy,i waited beside the bed for another few minutes and then as he still gave no sign of awakening i quietly left him,roth
1193,1194,at the nurse s desk i stopped to find out when he was due to go down to the operating room the next day,then from a telephone booth at the end of the corridor i phoned my brother in chicago,roth
1195,1196,i hope we re not doing this just to be doing something i said,won t put up with any distraction,roth
1197,1198,i ll speak to you tomorrow when he comes up from the operating room,just before hailing the cab i d been talking under the hotel canopy to the wife of an old friend whom i d run into as i was leaving the essex house on the way downtown to the hospital,roth
1199,1200,if i hadn t already lost time talking out in front of the hotel i would have decided against entrusting my life to those eyes and got out of the cab but as i wanted to be sure to be at the hospital to see my father before he went in to the operating room i said as a matter of fact no,one of my friends does,roth
1201,1202,we had a ways to go yet,it happens all the time buddy he told me,roth
1203,1204,hey i said and reminded him where we were going,to correct his error he decided to proceed all the way east to the fdr,roth
1205,1206,drive and then shoot south,this entailed going even farther in the wrong direction to get onto the drive,roth
1207,1208,i d allowed myself far more time than was necessary to get to the hospital by eleventhirty but now because of a tieup at the entrance to the drive it was already after eleven before the taxi had even begun to edge toward the heavy flow of southbound traffic,you a doctor he asked fixing me i saw in the mirror with that warlike look,roth
1209,1210,yes i said,no i said just one of the staff doctors,roth
1211,1212,the man was a mastodon and though the taxi was a fullsize sedan he overflowed his half of the front seat and rose to a fraction of an inch of the in his hands the wheel was a tiny infant an infant he was throttling,of his face all i could see in the mirror were those eyes which looked as though when they jumped out of his head they d be as capable as his hands of ending your life,roth
1213,1214,his aura was even more menacing than his opening remark had suggested and i didn t like the idea of shooting down the drive with him especially since it was not only from his having turned the wrong way almost right his attention was targeted on something more compelling than taking me where i wanted to go,you know something doc he said swinging suddenly with no lack of daring into the fast lane going south my old man s in his grave now without his four front teeth,roth
1215,1216,misery loves company,he used to get my older brother to beat me up on the street,roth
1217,1218,my older brother beat me up and my old man never stopped him,so one day when i was twenty i went up to him and knocked his fucking teeth out and i said you know what that s for,roth
1219,1220,for never protecting me against bobby i didn t go to his funeral even,you re not the first i assured him,roth
1221,1222,my mother is no better he said and mother he expectorated as though it were not a word but something putrid that he d bit into,but he had me wrong if he believed i was an ironist of the sort who like his father needed to go to his grave minus four front teeth,roth
1223,1224,i was a psychiatrist i did not stoop to judgments and that fortunately seemed to sink in soon enough,he was by no means stupid but boy was he lacking in trust,roth
1225,1226,by having failed to protect him from bobby his late father had unleashed upon the world one very skeptical younger son,i would have been no more surprised had he raised a teacup from the seat beside him and with his pinky pointing politely daintily taken a little sip,roth
1227,1228,what the hell are you talking about,you shouldn t have to pay for my mistake swinging from the drive onto thirtyfourth street he grew still more magnanimous,roth
1229,1230,i looked in the mirror expecting to find that he was ready to kill me for calling him kind,but no he liked it,roth
1231,1232,this guy is human i thought in the worst sense of the word,in front of the hospital when i hopped out of the cab i was a good psychiatrist and gave him the only advice i thought he could actually follow,roth
1233,1234,keep punchin i told him,hey you too doc he said and the face which i now saw was that of a manbaby of an overfleshed harddrinking rancorous infant age forty had dissolved into a surfeited smile indicating that on just my first professional outing a positive transference had been effected,roth
1235,1236,he actually did it i realized annihilated the father,he is of the primal horde of sons who as freud liked to surmise have it in them to nullify the father by hate and fear him and after overcoming him honor him by devouring him,roth
1237,1238,and i m from the horde that can t throw a punch,we aren t like that and we can t do it to our fathers or to anyone else,roth
1239,1240,we re the sons appalled by violence with no capacity for inflicting physical pain useless at beating and clubbing unfit to pulverize even the most deserving enemy though not necessarily without turbulence temper even ferocity,we have teeth as the cannibals do but they are there imbedded in our jaws the better to help us articulate,roth
1241,1242,when we lay waste when we efface it isn t with raging fists or ruthless schemes or insane sprawling violence but with our words our brains with mentality with all the stuff that produced the poignant abyss between our fathers and us and that they themselves broke their backs to give us,encouraging us to be so smart and such yeshiva buchers they little knew how they were equipping us to leave them isolated and uncomprehending in the face of all our forceful babble,roth
1243,1244,i suppose it was the fear of this drastic outdistancing of my father that had caused me in my first years of college to feel as though i were something like his double or his medium emotionally to imagine that i was there at college in his behalf and that it wasn t just i who was being educated but he whom i was delivering from ignorance as well,just the opposite was happening of course every book i underlined and marginally notated every course i took and paper i wrote was expanding the mental divide that had been growing wider and wider between us since i had prematurely entered high school at twelve just about the age when he had left school for good to help support his immigrant parents and all their children,roth
1245,1246,yet for many months there was nothing my reasonable self could do to shake off the sense of merging with him that overcame me in the library and in the classroom and at my dormitory desk the impassioned if crazy conviction that i was somehow inhabited by him and quickening his intellect right along with mine,when i reached my father s hospital room it was empty,roth
1247,1248,there was nothing of his on the bedside table and in the closet i saw that his clothes his robe and his little suitcase were gone,most frightening to see was the bare mattress stripped of all its bedding,roth
1249,1250,i rushed back down the hall to the nurse s desk thinking it s over it s over he s been spared the worst and there to my enormous relief i learned that he had simply been taken to the operating room a few minutes earlier,i d missed him because of the extended session with my own patient the parricidal driver,roth
1251,1252,he was not dead,i sat beside his bed until visiting hours were over watching with wonder as his pulse maintained itself at a steady rate of sixty beats a minute,roth
1253,1254,around the room the other patients fresh from surgery were registering drastically fluctuating blood pressure readings while his remained virtually fixed at over,i couldn t of course interpret the ekg pattern flickering steadily across the screen but it didn t seem to me to be signaling anything erratic or arrhythmical,roth
1255,1256,he was still systemically a marvel and therefore fated to be spared nothing,they had given him ice to suck on to ease the pain inside his mouth,roth
1257,1258,i kept feeding it to him and replenishing the bowl,his mouth hurt so much he could hardly talk,roth
1259,1260,and when he finally had something to say he made it short and sweet,how do you feel now i asked after he d been up from the recovery room for about an hour,roth
1261,1262,the voice was weak the tone grim the message unambiguous,in the bed across the way there was a very frail old oriental man with a tube inserted directly into his throat,roth
1263,1264,he d had intestinal surgery and kept gagging wretchedly and trying to hawk up phlegm,his daughter a rather pretty little woman of about forty terrifically efficient and concentrated entirely on her father silently went about doing what she could to make him comfortable but it did not seem possible to alleviate his misery,roth
1265,1266,though his face remained expressionless every few minutes we heard him struggling with the tube as if he were about to choke to death,the mouth i asked,roth
1267,1268,he shook his head to indicate that his mouth still felt awful,the nurse said that the doctor had decided that my father was in too much distress to leave that day,roth
1269,1270,he also hadn t urinated and they couldn t let him go home until he had,my father told me that he hadn t moved his bowels either and he kept getting out of the bed to go to the toilet and try,roth
1271,1272,each time i would guide him to the bathroom and then stand outside the door waiting there in case he needed help,from time to time the oriental woman and i looked at each other tending our fathers and smiled,roth
1273,1274,lil came to visit seth came with his wife ruth sandy and helen phoned him from chicago claire who was back from london phoned him from connecticut jonathan phoned him from where he was working out on the road and then late in the day while i was helping him to eat what he could of his watery unappetizing supper dr,benjamin appeared tailored splendidly and radiating all the selfassurance that one would hope to see in one s neurosurgeon,roth
1275,1276,he was accompanied by a crisplooking administrative aide in a tie and a white shirt who exercised his duty with military precision,by comparison my father slumped in front of his supper tray his foodstained hospital gown ineptly tied at the back his teeth out and half his face down the drain looked like a small old the small old lady he looked like was his mother bertha zahnstecher roth as i remembered her in the hospital near the end of her life,roth
1277,1278,i recalled very clearly being home from college and standing beside her bed while he was feeding her and she was mumbling to him in yiddish,benjamin gave us the results of the biopsy,roth
1279,1280,the tumor was an extremely rare type formed out of a kind of cartilaginous material a little like your fingernail he told my father,it was benign but not susceptible to radiation,roth
1281,1282,he proposed to remove it surgically in two operations each about seven or eight hours long,the first time he would go in through the mouth to extract part of the bulk that way and then some months later he would go in through the back of the head to extract the rest,roth
1283,1284,probably it hadn t been tactically possible for him but i wished that the doctor could have taken me aside to apprise me of all this first,it was a lot to tell an old man whose strength that evening you could have measured in teaspoons,roth
1285,1286,after the doctor had spoken his piece my father looked for a long time at the tray on which they d served him another dinner of cold consommé and yogurt and a chocolate drink and jello and a popsicle,it was impossible to guess from his lost unfocused gaze what if anything he was thinking about,roth
1287,1288,i was thinking of the fingernail that had been aggrandizing the hollows of his skull for a decade the material as obdurate and gristly as he was that had cracked open the bone behind his nose and with a stubborn unrelenting force just like his had pushed tusklike through into the cavities of his face,when finally my father seemed to remember benjamin s presence he looked up and said to him well doctor i ve got a lot of people waiting for me on the other side and with his head jutting out toward the bowl he dropped his spoon into the jello and resumed the attempt to eat something,roth
1289,1290,i walked out into the corridor with the doctor and his aide,i don t see how he could survive two operations like that i said,roth
1291,1292,your father is a strong man the doctor replied,a strong eightysixyearold man,roth
1293,1294,we shook hands but as he and his aide started away he turned back to offer a gentle reminder,mr,roth
1295,1296,by the next morning he still hadn t urinated and as he didn t look forward to being catheterized any more than anyone else does i told him to go into the toilet and turn the water on in the sink and sit there until something happened,he went in three times and the last time after twenty minutes he came out and said it had worked,roth
1297,1298,he made it work,after i had helped him get into his street clothes i went off to phone my brother and tell him we were about to check out of the hospital and drive up to the connecticut house where claire and i had moved for the summer,roth
1299,1300,well now we know for sure that there s nothing to do i said to my brother,two operations are out of the question,roth
1301,1302,i went up to say goodbye to her,your father better she asked her english heavily accented and hard to make out,roth
1303,1304,for now i replied,your father is a brave man she said,roth
1305,1306,so is yours i said,the room had a woodburning stove in it and a brightcolored north african rug and it was a room he said that he always loved to sleep in during the years when he d come to visit with my mother and later after her death when he and lil came up a couple of times each summer for a weekend with us in the country,roth
1307,1308,i got him upstairs to take a nap after lunch,that morning claire had made a big pot of vegetable soup for him for the next few days and had cut some flowers in the garden to liven up his room but it turned out that he still couldn t take anything warm in his mouth and was so worn out from the twohour drive up from the hospital that he d just sat staring into the soup bowl unable to respond to her attempts to make him feel at home,roth
1309,1310,in his room he immediately fell asleep on top of the bedspread however when i came to check on him about twenty minutes later i saw as i passed the partially open door of the bathroom next to his bedroom that he was sitting on the toilet holding his head in his hands,on the way up we d had to stop twice at gas stations when he thought he might have to use a rest room,roth
1311,1312,you all right i called,it s okay it s okay he said but when i tried afterward to get him to take a little stroll around the grounds with me he said he was afraid to walk outside in case he needed to go to the toilet,roth
1313,1314,he still hadn t moved his bowels and he asked me to drive over to buy some prune juice at the general store to see if that would help,he was dreadfully down mentally and physically depleted though once when i happened to be in the hall outside the living room where he sat shrunkenlooking in the easy chair in front of the fireplace i heard him muttering something that turned out not to be about his own misery at all,roth
1315,1316,that poor chinaman he was saying,the next morning he was stronger at breakfast and was even able to drink some tepid tea and to tolerate in his mouth about half of the bowl of oatmeal that claire had prepared for him and cooled with some milk,roth
1317,1318,i went up to his bedroom while they were talking at the claire listened as he told her and not for the first time either what a saint his mother had been cooking for eight nine and ten people taking in immigrant relatives who arrived penniless at their door scrubbing the outside wooden staircase on her knees i intended to air his room make the bed for him and collect the soiled things from his hospital suitcase and take them over to the laundry that afternoon with our week s wash,but when i pulled back the top sheet of his bed i saw that the bottom sheet was stained with his blood and so was the seat of his fresh pajamas,roth
1319,1320,i threw his pajamas into the laundry hamper got him a clean pair of my own and then stripped the bed and made it up fresh,where his midsection would lie i stretched a double thickness of heavy bath towels across the width of the bed to prevent him from staining the bottom sheet again,roth
1321,1322,i was alarmed by the evidence of so much rectal bleeding and didn t know how to account for it,i wondered if he did,roth
1323,1324,i had no chance to find out because immediately after he had finished talking to cleaning up the breakfast dishes she d heard the details of the bankruptcy of the little shoe store he d opened up with my mother after their took the newspaper from the day before and went up again to the bathroom,four days he said mournfully,roth
1325,1326,the biopsy the anesthetic lying in the s thrown your system off,another day or two of regular meals a little exercise and you ll be fine,roth
1327,1328,how about coming outside,seth and ruth will be here any minute,roth
1329,1330,downstairs he said no to a walk and sank down in the living room easy chair again,i sat on the sofa with the times and offered to read to him about dukakis and bush,roth
1331,1332,bush he said disgustedly and his boss mr,raygun,roth
1333,1334,you know what he learned to do in eight years mr,raygun,roth
1335,1336,sleep and salute,the greatest saluter in the country,roth
1337,1338,i never saw a better saluter i began to read to him from the front page of the times but he interrupted to tell me that he had left his teeth upstairs and that he didn t want the children to see him without them,so i set down the paper and went upstairs to get them from the shelf beside the toilet where he d put them while he was trying in vain to move his bowels,roth
1339,1340,under the tap i rinsed the teeth of the remains of his breakfast and then carried them downstairs thinking his teeth his eyes his face his bowels his rectum his brain and there was plenty more left,it could be worse and it would be worse much worse but this was still a pretty healthy lot of misery for the beginning of an end,roth
1341,1342,one side of the room was now all sliding glass doors and looked off to the lawn the stone walls and the meadows and fields that opened out in front of the house,in the past i used to set him up there in a wicker chair facing the view and in warm weather he could sit all morning contentedly reading the daily times the news about israel first and then the articles about the reagan administration that enabled him to stoke up his hatred of the president for the rest of the day,roth
1343,1344,now with seth and ruth visiting for lunch and all of us making light conversation and the luminous day as seductive as a summer s day gets he was utterly isolated within a body that had become a terrifying escapeproof enclosure the holding pen in a slaughterhouse,near the end of lunch he pushed back his chair and started toward the steps to the kitchen,roth
1345,1346,it was the third time during the meal that he had got up to leave the table and i got up with him to help him upstairs,he wouldn t let me help however and since i figured he was setting off to try yet again to move his bowels i didn t want to embarrass him by insisting,roth
1347,1348,we were drinking our coffee when it occurred to me that he was still gone,i quietly left the table and while the others were talking slipped into the house certain that he was dead,roth
1349,1350,he wasn t though he might well have been wishing that he were,i smelled the shit halfway up the stairs to the second floor,roth
1351,1352,when i got to his bathroom the door was ajar and on the floor of the corridor outside the bathroom were his dungarees and his undershorts,standing inside the bathroom door was my father completely naked just out of the shower and dripping wet,roth
1353,1354,the smell was overwhelming,at the sight of me he came close to bursting into tears,roth
1355,1356,in a voice as forlorn as any i had ever heard from him or anyone he told me what it hadn t been difficult to surmise,i beshat myself he said,roth
1357,1358,the shit was everywhere smeared underfoot on the bathmat running over the toilet bowl edge and at the foot of the bowl in a pile on the floor,it was splattered across the glass of the shower stall from which he d just emerged and the clothes discarded in the hallway were clotted with it,roth
1359,1360,it was on the corner of the towel he had started to dry himself with,in this smallish bathroom which was ordinarily mine he had done his best to extricate himself from his mess alone but as he was nearly blind and just up out of a hospital bed in undressing himself and getting into the shower he had managed to spread the shit over everything,roth
1361,1362,i saw that it was even on the tips of the bristles of my toothbrush hanging in the holder over the sink,taking the towel out of his hand i helped him back under the shower,roth
1363,1364,take the soap and start from scratch i said and while he obediently began again to soap his body all over i gathered his clothes and the towels and the bathmat together in a heap and went down the hall to the linen closet and got a pillowcase to dump them in,i also found a fresh bath towel for him,roth
1365,1366,then i got him out of the shower and took him straight into the hallway where the floor was still clean and wrapped him up in the towel and began to dry him,i got him into his bedroom where he sat on the edge of the bed and continued to towel himself while i went off and got a terrycloth robe of mine,roth
1367,1368,when he was dry i helped him into the robe and then pulled back the top sheet of the bed and told him to get in and take a nap,don t tell the children he said looking up at me from the bed with his one sighted eye,roth
1369,1370,i won t tell anyone i said,don t worry about it,roth
1371,1372,it could have happened to anyone,the bathroom looked as though some spiteful thug had left his calling card after having robbed the house,roth
1373,1374,as my father was tended to and he was what counted i would just as soon have nailed the door shut and forgotten that bathroom forever,it s like writing a book i i have no idea where to begin but i stepped gingerly across the floor and reached out and threw open the window which was a start,roth
1375,1376,then i went down the back stairway to the kitchen and keeping out of sight of seth and ruth and claire who were still in the summer room talking i got a bucket a brush and a box of spic and span from the cabinet under the sink and two rolls of paper towels and came back upstairs to the bathroom,where his shit lay in front of the toilet bowl in what was more or less a contiguous mass it was easiest to get rid of,roth
1377,1378,just scoop it up and flush it away,and the shower door and the windowsill and the sink and the soap dish and the light fixtures and the towel bars were no problem,roth
1379,1380,lots of paper towels and lots of soap,but where it had lodged in the narrow uneven crevices of the floor between the wide old chestnut planks i had my work cut out for me,roth
1381,1382,the scrub brush seemed only to make things worse and eventually i took down my toothbrush and dipping it in and out of the bucket of hot sudsy water proceeded inch by inch from wall to wall one crevice at a time until the floor was as clean as i could get it,after some fifteen minutes on my knees i decided that flecks and particles down so deep that i still couldn t reach them we would simply all live with,roth
1383,1384,i removed the curtain from the window even though it looked to be clean and shoved it in the pillowcase with all the other soiled things and then i went into claire s bathroom and got some eau de cologne which i sprinkled freely over the swabbed and scoured room flicking it off my fingertips like holy water,i set up a small summer fan in one corner and got it going and i went back to claire s bathroom and washed my arms and my hands and my face,roth
1385,1386,there was a little shit in my hair so i washed that out too,i tiptoed back into the bedroom where he was asleep still breathing still living still with another setback outlasted by this man whom i had known unendingly as my father,roth
1387,1388,i felt awful about his heroic hapless struggle to cleanse himself before i had got up to the bathroom and about the shame of it the disgrace he felt himself to be and yet now that it was over and he was so deep in sleep i thought i couldn t have asked anything more for myself before he too was right and as it should be,you clean up your father s shit because it has to be cleaned up but in the aftermath of cleaning it up everything that s there to feel is felt as it never was before,roth
1389,1390,it wasn t the first time that i d understood this either once you sidestep disgust and ignore nausea and plunge past those phobias that are fortified like taboos there s an awful lot of life to cherish,though maybe once is enough i added addressing myself mentally to the sleeping brain squeezed in by the cartilaginous tumor if i have to do this every day i may not wind up feeling quite so thrilled,roth
1391,1392,i carried the stinking pillowcase downstairs and put it into a black garbage bag which i tied shut and i carried the bag out to the car and dumped it in the trunk to take to the laundry,and why this was right and as it should be couldn t have been plainer to me now that the job was done,roth
1393,1394,so that was the patrimony,and not because cleaning it up was symbolic of something else but because it wasn t because it was nothing less or more than the lived reality that it was,roth
1395,1396,there was my patrimony not the money not the tefillin not the shaving mug but the shit,i helped him bathe the next night,roth
1397,1398,that morning making up his bed i had again found blood stains on his pajama trousers and on the layer of bath towels covering the bottom sheet and when i d asked if he was aware of all that blood he told me that it was what happened when he didn t take a sitz bath before going to sleep,but if that s all it is you can bathe in the front bathroom i said,roth
1399,1400,you should have told me,i sat on the edge of the tub while the water ran testing the temperature with my mother i remembered used to test it with her elbow,roth
1401,1402,he sat waiting on the lowered toilet seat in my red terrycloth robe,when the tub was full i put the rubberized shower mat on the tub floor to guard against his taking a fall getting in and out,roth
1403,1404,then i offered my arm but he wouldn t let me help him even when i insisted,instead he made me stand aside and by kneeling and swiveling about he managed to get one leg into the water and then the other and once inside to circle around slowly on his knees until he was facing the front,roth
1405,1406,that s a complicated maneuver i said,weakly at first then more vigorously he began to flex his knees and i could see the muscles working in his thin shanks,roth
1407,1408,i looked at his penis,i don t believe i d seen it since i was a small boy and back then i used to think it was quite big,roth
1409,1410,it turned out that i had been right,it was thick and substantial and the one bodily part that didn t look at all old,roth
1411,1412,it looked pretty serviceable,stouter around i noticed than my own,roth
1413,1414,good for him i thought,if it gave some pleasure to him and my mother all the better i looked at it intently as though for the very first time and waited on the thoughts,roth
1415,1416,but there weren t any more except my reminding myself to fix it in my memory for when he was dead,it might prevent him from becoming ethereally attenuated as the years went by,roth
1417,1418,i must remember accurately i told myself remember everything accurately so that when he is gone i can recreate the father who created me you must not forget anything,he was kicking his legs forcefully up and down now rather like a baby playing in the water but there was nothing of a baby s delight in his grimly set halfface,roth
1419,1420,he seemed in deadly earnest about this bath as though like nearly everything of late it too must be undertaken with the utmost determination,it was after i was transferred to south jersey he told me,roth
1421,1422,i just took over the maple shade district,i had forty men down there,roth
1423,1424,big office,twelve secretaries,roth
1425,1426,i got a phone call in the middle of the night that there was somebody in the they said broke into the office,i got out of bed and before i could make it to the toilet the same thing happened,roth
1427,1428,then with a hand on each side of his buttocks he held his cheeks apart,the doctor told me to do this he said,roth
1429,1430,fine i said,it s a good idea,roth
1431,1432,he was a manager who drove his employees as unsparingly as he drove himself and the transfer to the maple shade district had been his third promotion since when he d been elevated from an assistant manager in newark,what these promotions meant was that he was given responsibility for a larger office with a greater potential for increasing his income but in even worse shape and doing less business than the previous office which he had rescued from its difficulties and whipped into one of the most productive in the territory,roth
1433,1434,for him advancement was generally a kind of demotion as well and the struggle was perpetually uphill,as i sat watching him let the warm water soothe the rectal fissures that he had told me caused his bleeding i was thinking that the metropolitan life insurance company could never sufficiently have recognized what it was they had in herman roth,roth
1435,1436,they had rewarded him with a decent enough pension on his retirement twentythree years before and during his working life he had received numerous plaques and scrolls and lapel buttons attesting to his achievement,scores of managers must of course have worked as hard and with no less success but of the thousand metropolitan district managers scattered around the country there simply could not have been another who on being notified in the middle of the night that his office had been broken into use his beshat himself out of fear,roth
1437,1438,for that kind of fealty the company should have beatified herman roth as the church beatifies martyrs who suffer for its cause,and had i as his son received devotion any less primitive and slavish,roth
1439,1440,not always the most enlightened devotion from which i already wanted to be disentangled by the time i was sixteen and feeling myself beginning to be disfigured by it but devotion that i now found gratifying to be able to requite somewhat by sitting on the lid of the toilet overseeing him as he kicked his legs up and down like a baby in a bassinet,you can say that it doesn t mean much for a son to be tenderly protective of a father once the father is powerless and nearly destroyed,roth
1441,1442,i can only reply that i felt as protective of his vulnerability as an emotional family man vulnerable to family friction as a breadwinner vulnerable to financial uncertainty as a roughhewn son of jewish immigrants vulnerable to social prejudice when i was still at home and he was powerfully healthy and driving me crazy with advice that was useless and strictures that were pointless and reasoning that caused me all alone in my room to smack my forehead and howl in despair,this was exactly the discrepancy that had made repudiating his authority such an oppressive conflict as laden with grief as it was with scorn,roth
1443,1444,he wasn t just any father he was the father with everything there is to hate in a father and everything there is to love,i would have thought he d say like a father to me but his description was in fact more discriminating than my commonplace expectations while at the same time much more flagrant unblinking and enviably unselfconsciously blunt,roth
1445,1446,yes he was always teaching me something not the conventional american dad stuff not the school stuff or the sports stuff or the prince charming stuff but something coarser than could be accommodated by my predictably vainglorious boyhood yearnings for a judicious dignified father to replace the undereducated father who i found myself halfashamed of at the very same time that his assailability particularly as a target of antisemitic discrimination quickened my solidarity with him and hardened my hatred of his belittlers he taught me the vernacular,he was the vernacular unpoetic and expressive and pointblank with all the vernacular s glaring limitations and all its durable force,roth
1447,1448,antisemitism had in fact been the subject of a brief exchange only the previous fall between john creedon the president and ceo,of metropolitan life and me as a result of an autobiographical piece that i d published in the new york times book review in october,roth
1449,1450,after reminding me that he had met my father several years earlier creedon went on to tell me that my father had said nothing to him on that occasion about any such discrimination and he was certainly confident creedon continued that no discrimination of any sort existed at the metropolitan today,what had actually prompted him to write he said was a letter taking exception to my times piece from an old associate of his a retired md,roth
1451,1452,who had been an officer of the company in the,along with his own letter creedon enclosed the correspondence i had unwittingly instigated between the two of them,roth
1453,1454,the doctor s letter to creedon devoted three paragraphs to refuting my characterization of the metropolitan as discriminatory during the thirties and forties,he told creedon that he was shocked that philip roth should believe this and as evidence to the contrary noted that one of the best known senior officers of the metropolitan was a jew louis i dublin worldfamous for his public health and statistical pronouncements in the name of metropolitan and that another jew lee frankel was a senior officer and virtually the righthand man of haley fisk the company president,roth
1455,1456,i suppose he went on mr,roth will say in his defense that these are his childhood impressions and perhaps he is just reflecting comments and attitudes expressed at home about the company,roth
1457,1458,creedon described my father as an interesting person and added that if the views he d once held about the metropolitan s religious bias were accurately reported in his son s autobiography they had clearly changed since,if the doctor was shocked that i should think that a great american insurance company had ever discriminated against jews i was myself not a little surprised that two of that company s eminent executives whose letters were otherwise wholly wellmeaning should find this simple historical fact had still to be denied in the late even to themselves,roth
1459,1460,however had there been nothing more annoying in these letters than this unlikely innocence i probably would have responded with a cordial note saying that i had reason to hold a different opinion and ended it there,what rankled me and goaded me on was that they were both determined to blame an unflattering perception of their company on my father on unsubstantiated attitudes and views of his rather than on the company s prior practices,roth
1461,1462,i phoned my father after getting these letters and said to him hey you were wrong all those years about the metropolitan,they loved jews,roth
1463,1464,couldn t promote them fast enough,when i was finished he began to laugh a little sardonically,roth
1465,1466,well what do you think i said,the guy s wet behind the ears,roth
1467,1468,sure dublin was a jew he said,so was my boss peterfreund,roth
1469,1470,but for a jew to advance in that company like a christian,in those days,roth
1471,1472,come on,i d been directed there by one of the officers of the b nai brith antidefamation league when i d phoned the adl,roth
1473,1474,to ask where i might do research on discrimination in the insurance industry,after i d compiled pages of notes drawn from articles published over the years in the new york times from memos of the civil rights section of the ajc and from various books and periodicals i composed a twoandahalfpage letter to john creedon providing documentation for those attitudes of my father s which he and the doctor had been so quick to discredit,roth
1475,1476,since the passage of the fair employment practice act in there has of course been steady and successful pressure on business and industries previously discriminatory to recruit hire and promote to managerial and executive positions members of minority groups,i ended by saying in the light of what all these findings reveal about discriminatory practices in the history of the major american insurance companies i wonder why it should be my father s views that you hope have changed the historical facts do not allow for a revision of his views,roth
1477,1478,after he read it he didn t seem to know what to make of what i had done,how do you find all this stuff he asked me,roth
1479,1480,the archives at the american jewish committee,creedon,roth
1481,1482,you know how much pension i ve received since i retired,i figured it out here just last week,roth
1483,1484,am i he laughed,i had nothing absolutely nothing,roth
1485,1486,mother and i were flat broke and they hired me,you worked,roth
1487,1488,you sweated blood for them,you have a history and so do they,roth
1489,1490,what s so unusual about that,do me a favor will you,roth
1491,1492,in my zuckerman novels i had given nathan zuckerman a father who could not stand his writer son s depiction of jewish characters whereas fate had given me a fiercely loyal and devoted father who had never found a thing in my books to enraged him were the jews who attacked my books as antisemitic and selfhating,no what made my father nervous wasn t what i wrote about jews but as it turned out what i had now written about gentiles to gentiles and to gentiles who had been his bosses,roth
1493,1494,i certainly didn t mean to upset you,to me he never mentioned it again nor did i receive a reply from anyone at the metropolitan,roth
1495,1496,he was with us in connecticut for a week after the biopsy and by the time he was ready to return to elizabeth there was very little pain in his mouth and he was able to eat again with appetite he had gained back the few pounds that he d lost in the hospital and even recovered enough strength to take a short walk with me after breakfast and again in the afternoon,every morning he came into the kitchen saying slept like a top and in the evening after dinner he sat across from claire with his coffee and long after i had slipped away to read or to watch the ball game he was still in the kitchen narrating his stories to her about the family and their fortunes in america,roth
1497,1498,they were tedious stories to anyone who had grown up outside the family largely pointless stories and one would have assumed by now tremendously repetitious even to him this one died this one married this one lost his money this one lost his wife this one thank god finally did okay,yet he recited them night after night with no less freshness than yul brynner singing tis a puzzlement in the king and i for the four thousandth time,roth
1499,1500,every night at the kitchen table claire sat and listened drooping with boredom but by no means unimpressed by the urgency with which this meandering saga unfolded or by the hypnotic hold that the mundane destiny of an ordinary immigrant family seemed still to have on him in his eightyseventh year,how his late brother charlie who d died in married fanny spitzer in how after fanny died fourteen years later charlie married sophie lasker how sophie was a mother to milton rhoda kenny and jeanette how in only twentyeight years old jeanette died how his brother morris the gogetting prosperous brother who died at twentynine had a shoelace factory down on pacific street where my grandfather used to put tips on the shoelaces how morris had two houses and four garages how when he died he left his fortune behind to a spendthrift wife who after morris s death bought a velie,roth
1501,1502,you ever hear of the velie automobile,look it up,roth
1503,1504,velie,it was a big roadster,roth
1505,1506,everything went ella sold everything,then she got married again,roth
1507,1508,she married a guy and he impregnated her and she thought she had a lump in her stomach,and this guy was an army captain and he took all her money morris s fortune and he went to germany he made her buy her father uncle klein said they had to pay the money to an american bank and he wouldn t give up the bill of lading,roth
1509,1510,uncle klein used to have a fiveandtencent store on the corner of avon clinton avenue clinton and hunterdon it was his deuteronomy the history of his israel and ever since his retirement whether he was on a caribbean cruise or in a florida hotel lobby or in a doctor s waiting room very few who wound up sitting across from him for any length of time didn t get at least the abridged version of his sacred text,gentiles whom he had sometimes run into in his travels with my mother had been known to pick themselves up and move off in midsentence and even on those occasions when my mother dared to explain to him why a perfect stranger might not be interested in charlie s belmont avenue shoe store or morris s motion picture theater next door to the shoelace factory on pacific street he never seemed to get the idea or to want to,roth
1511,1512,all the privation and rebuilding and regeneration all those people all that dying all their could anyone fail to be moved and even ultimately to be as awestruck as he was by how in america our roths had persevered and endured,at the end of the week i drove him home to elizabeth stopping first in manhattan to take him to the ophthalmologist,roth
1513,1514,we had decided that there was nothing to do now but forget the tumor and proceed with the eye operation,he was to have a preoperative examination that afternoon and was scheduled to go back into the hospital at the beginning of july after the holiday weekend for the removal of the cataract,roth
1515,1516,my brother was flying in to see him through that,as he was ninety percent blind in the right eye the operation on the other eye was going to render him virtually sightless the doctor told us for perhaps as long as three or four weeks,roth
1517,1518,we had very little time to find somebody to look after him during his convalescence but fortunately after only a day or two of phoning around i discovered that my brother s former housekeeper ingrid burlin who for five years had helped sandy raise his two boys after his first wife died of cancer in was just completing a job with a manhattan family,ingrid was willing to begin working for us the day he got home from the cataract operation and to continue on until he left with lil in december for their four months in west palm beach if the tumor spared him for west palm beach,roth
1519,1520,ingrid was now in her forties an exceedingly goodnatured intelligent and reliable woman to whom both my mother and my father had grown very close during the years she d been with my brother and it seemed a piece of astonishing good luck that she should be available to look after him at just this moment,ingrid was to come in on the bus from manhattan for eight hours a day five or six days a week to cook for him shop for him keep the apartment clean for him and what afforded us the most relief keep him company all day while he was housebound,roth
1521,1522,since sandy and i knew that our father wasn t about to dip into his cds or his savings accounts in order to pay ingrid s salary we agreed to divide the cost between us and to reimburse ourselves from the bequest after his death,there was enough money there to pay ingrid for three years if as was unlikely he remained alive that long,roth
1523,1524,on the drive down when i saw that his spirits had begun to plummet now that the week with us was over and everything loomed up just as overwhelmingly as it had before i reminded him that ingrid s presence was going to make a big was the cataract operation,what with ingrid around the house and his sight restored he would be far less dependent on lil and perhaps the tension between them that his illness had exacerbated would become manageable again,roth
1525,1526,but saying that got him going in a way i hadn t foreseen,suddenly she s a jew he said to me,roth
1527,1528,i had to drag her to services,till she knew me she never went at all,roth
1529,1530,lil didn t even know where the synagogue was,but the friday before my operation she left me to go to services,roth
1531,1532,i told her even a dog stands by his master,he was rather in the mood to hate now that he was headed home,roth
1533,1534,i wondered if some of what he expressed might not be veiled hatred of me for taking him home,or maybe he was furious over that question he had not bothered to ask dr,roth
1535,1536,benjamin or dr,meyerson or me the writer son because he knew that none of us even with all our schooling our degrees our smooth sentences and clever words could make any more sense of it than he did,roth
1537,1538,why should a man die,it was enough to put anybody in a rage that question,roth
1539,1540,he was indispensable goddamnit if no longer to others then to himself,so why should he die,roth
1541,1542,someone with brains answer that,she doesn t do anything right he told me,roth
1543,1544,nor could i remind him now that the bal harbour women whom he d wowed in when he d appeared in the condominium pool freshly widowered doing fifteen minutes of his methodical slow breaststroke every noon and then in his trunks and his robe sitting in the sun telling the girls the jokes from the elizabeth not be so crazy for the company of the man he was in,he didn t need me to remind him anyway it occurred to him spontaneously a second or two later and made him even angrier than before this time ostensibly at lil s sister not a great favorite of his nor he of hers from what i surmised,roth
1545,1546,why doesn t she marry her he demanded,only he was married if not to my mother any longer to their marriage,roth
1547,1548,some time ago in a mellower mood he d said to me i sometimes think that mother sent lil to me i was surprised by this dreaminess which was so very uncharacteristic but as i didn t see where it did any wondered even if it might not be just the lullaby to soothe his conscience and diminish a little the shame and guilt perpetuating his fidelity to a said who knows,maybe she did he d seemed to be trying to find a way not so much to loving lil wholeheartedly even he was too experienced to expect that as to granting her a position of equality in his distinctive clan with what was to him its unparalleled history,roth
1549,1550,he had always been wonderfully attentive and devoted to any friend who was ill and probably never came closer to being a loving husband than when he supported lil over the period of a year through two mastectomies and afterward helped nurse her back to health,but only as his patient did she get anywhere near being a darling wife and once he began to falter once he became increasingly needy himself she was doomed by being imperfect never to achieve the status of bess roth whom he now exalted along with his mother as a paragon of womanhood,roth
1551,1552,with lil once the romantic infatuation had waned he lived out the less censored version of what he had done with my mother particularly toward the end,temporarily worn down by the rush of rage he soon let his head slump forward and fell asleep,roth
1553,1554,when he awoke on route the object of his fury was drivers and driving,somebody changed lanes in front of me he said disgustedly what the hell is that guy doing somebody whizzed past me on my left he cried doesn t anybody observe the fiftyfivemile limit anymore then these goddamn trucks then smoking,roth
1555,1556,now they ve got the telephones,there s a brilliant invention,roth
1557,1558,they drive and they talk on the telephone,maybe ingrid can help out abe he suddenly said to me,roth
1559,1560,what,abe appeared to be quite alert and moved with an amazingly upright confident gait for a man that old though when he and my father went off in the afternoon to take their turn around the block they linked arms to be sure that neither of them tripped on the cracked cement of the local sidewalks,roth
1561,1562,the halt and the blind my father called the pair of them wryly,sometimes they went down north broad street as far as the drugstore sometimes they accompanied each other to the barbershop and one day when i drove over they d just come back from going to vote together in the mayoral primary,roth
1563,1564,the results of the primary were a foregone conclusion my father told me but voting had given him and abe something to do,i got up and answered the phone and there was abe on the other end a real zing in his sprightly voice,roth
1565,1566,hello herman no philip i said,your father want to take a walk he wants to sit and talk now abe,roth
1567,1568,maybe he ll go out later barely ten minutes had passed when the phone rang again,your father want to take a walk no abe not right now i m afraid and after i d hung up for the second time i left the receiver off the hook just as i had the night before my mother s funeral when wilkins another neighbor was trying to spook my father with his crazy laugh,roth
1569,1570,what s ingrid s number in new york,david krohn moved heaven and earth to get you scheduled as soon as possible,roth
1571,1572,i wept for half an hour he said,and you know who i realize i was weeping for,roth
1573,1574,mother,when she died i ran around the hospital shouting where s my wife,roth
1575,1576,what are you doing for my wife i didn t have time to cry i was so angry,in the meantime he d had the cataract to his left eye practically he and lil had gone to florida for their usual stay of four months,roth
1577,1578,in december in palm beach they even attended the wedding that sandy kuvin had invited him to the previous spring back when the brain surgeon had told me that unless we okayed the operation in a relatively short time he d be much worse when i thought that he d never see florida again,when he returned to elizabeth at the end of march and i went over to welcome him home i saw that his condition had already worsened since i d visited him in florida the month before,roth
1579,1580,his head was beginning to hurt him practically every day the facial paralysis seemed to have got worse causing his speech to thicken now nearly to the point of unintelligibility and he had become alarmingly unsteady on his feet,late one night a few weeks after coming home when he got out of bed to go to the bathroom he lost his balance or momentarily blacked out and fell,roth
1581,1582,he was on the bathroom floor some ten minutes before lil woke up and heard him calling,he came away with nothing worse than some badly bruised ribs but the damage to his morale was enormous,roth
1583,1584,at about this time a friend told me about a living will a legal document its own you to declare in advance that in the event of extreme physical or mental disability from which there s no reasonable expectation of recovery you refuse any sort of lifesupport system,the signer designates who will make the necessary medical treatment decisions if he or she is incapable of doing so,roth
1585,1586,i called my lawyer to ask if living wills were valid in new jersey and when she said yes i instructed her to draw up two living wills one for my father and another for me,the next week i drove over to new jersey to have dinner with my father lil and ingrid who was working as his housekeeper again now that he was d begun the previous july just after he d had the cataract removed,roth
1587,1588,i brought with me my own living will signed and notarized at a local luncheonette that afternoon and the living will that had been prepared by my lawyer for him which assigned the power to make medical he was not my brother and me,i was hoping that if i showed him that i d had a living will drawn up for myself signing his might seem to him not so much portentous as commonsensical something any adult ought to do regardless of age or physical condition,roth
1589,1590,but when i got there and discovered how depressed he still was as a result of the bathroom fall i found it was even harder for me to talk about the living will than it had been to tell him about the brain tumor the year before,in fact i couldn t do it,roth
1591,1592,ingrid had prepared a big turkey dinner and i had brought some wine and we sat a long time at the dining table where instead of explaining what a living will was and why i wanted him to have one i tried to get his mind as far from death as i could by telling him about a book that i d just finished reading,i d picked it up while browsing in a judaica store on upper broadway when i d been out taking a walk a few days before,roth
1593,1594,it was called the jewish boxers hall of archive photographs and chapterlong biographies of thirtynine boxers a number of them world champions or title claimants who had been active in the ring when my father was young,as a boy along with my brother i had been taken by him to the thursday night fights at newark s laurel garden and though i for one no longer had an interest in the sport he still enjoyed enormously watching boxing on television,roth
1595,1596,i asked him how many of the oldtime jewish fighters he thought he could name,i thought i saw him fight,roth
1597,1598,there was what shisname the big lug levinsky,ruby goldstein,roth
1599,1600,he dropped dead refereeing a fight at the old st,nick s arena,roth
1601,1602,but there was lew tendler,he finally opened a restaurant,roth
1603,1604,i used to go to it in philadelphia,a steak house,roth
1605,1606,they were terrific characters,they were poor boys just like the colored that made the grade in boxing,roth
1607,1608,most of them wasted their money they died poor men,the only one who i think made money was tendler,roth
1609,1610,i remember the era very vividly of tendler attell and leonard,barney ross,roth
1611,1612,he was a helluva fighter,i saw him fight in newark,roth
1613,1614,there was bummy was a jew,there was slapsie maxie rosenbloom,roth
1615,1616,sure,abie bain my father said he was a nut from jersey hillside around these parts,roth
1617,1618,and he was a bum,they were all bums,roth
1619,1620,you know how it was these kids grew up they had a tough life the slums no money and they always had an adversary,the christian religion was an adversary,roth
1621,1622,they fought two battles,they fought because they were fighters and they fought because they were jews,roth
1623,1624,they d put two guys in the ring an italian and a jew an irishman and a jew and they fought like they meant it they fought to hurt,there was always a certain amount of hatred in it,roth
1625,1626,charlie was no good even as a kid my father said,how so i asked,roth
1627,1628,they threw him out and put him in an ungraded school and he wound up killing people for longie,they were a bad bunch charlie and his friends,roth
1629,1630,they were all jewish boys around the third ward,the polocks used to kill the jews who had beards in the third ward i m saying not just in the old country and so the jewish boys started a had a name but it doesn t come to me right they d kill the polocks,roth
1631,1632,i mean personally kill them,they were all no good,roth
1633,1634,he died,natural causes,roth
1635,1636,he wasn t that old,even the bastards die my father said,roth
1637,1638,enough i thought and went home where unable to sleep i passed the night studying in appendix v the wonandlost records of some fifty jewish world champions and contenders including jersey s own abie bain who d won by eleven and strangely according to this book had thirtyone no decisions,early the next morning however before he d begun to have a chance to be worn down by worrying i telephoned my father and launched into my spiel i told him how my lawyer had suggested that i ought to have a living will how she had explained its function to me how i had said it sounded like a good idea and had asked her as she was preparing one for me to draw up one for him as well,roth
1639,1640,i said let me read you mine,listen and of course his reaction was nothing like what i d feared it would be,roth
1641,1642,how could i have forgotten that i was dealing with somebody who d spent a lifetime talking to people about the thing they least wanted to think about,when i was a small boy and would go with him to his office on a saturday morning he used to tell me life insurance is the hardest thing in the world to sell,roth
1643,1644,you know why,because the only way the customer can win is if he dies he was an old and knowledgeable expert in these contracts dealing with death more used to them by far than i was and as i slowly read him each sentence over the phone he responded as matteroffactly as if i were reading the fineprint boilerplate prose off an insurance policy,roth
1645,1646,then i said so,instead of feeling like the insurance man s son i felt like an insurance man myself one who d just sold his first policy to a customer who could win only if he died,roth
1647,1648,when claire and i went for dinner on a may friday a few weeks later the focus of the evening as far as i knew was to be ingrid s wonderful bouillabaisse a dish my father liked to eat but couldn t for the life of him pronounce,for convenience s sake he had come to call it ballaboosteh a workable and witty enough approximation since that is the yiddish encomium for housewife or homemaker and it seemed to encapsulate both the heartiness of the fare that ingrid was cooking up for us and the soothing managerial role she had quickly come to play in the household,roth
1649,1650,despite his now having to hold his arms out to balance himself against the walls of the apartment when he moved from room to having to take only the tiniest steps so as to keep from s presence had enormously alleviated his sense of vulnerability and thus contrary to my naive expectations enabled him to increase his criticism of lil,i didn t think that it was possible for him to ferret out still more things that were wrong with her but for lil s imperfections even with only one good eye his vision was microscopic,roth
1651,1652,she can t even buy a cantaloupe he told me in disgust on the phone one morning and because i had by then heard just about enough on the general subject of what lil could not do i answered look a cantaloupe is a hard thing to the hardest thing there is to buy when you stop to think about it,a cantaloupe isn t an apple you know where you can tell from the outside what s going on inside,roth
1653,1654,i d rather buy a car than a d rather buy a house than a cantaloupe,if one time in ten i come away from the store with a decent cantaloupe i consider myself lucky,roth
1655,1656,i smell it sniff it press both ends with my thumb i smell another one press down again with my nine ten cantaloupes i can go through like this before finally i settle on one and i take it home and we cut it open for dinner and the thing is tasteless and hard as a rock,i ll tell you about making a mistake with a cantaloupe we all do it,roth
1657,1658,we weren t made to buy cantaloupe,do me a favor herm get off the woman s ass because it isn t just lil s weakness buying a shitty cantaloupe it s a human weakness,roth
1659,1660,on the friday evening we joined my father lil ingrid and seth and ruth for dinner in elizabeth our centerpiece turned out to be not the bouillabaisse but a guest whose presence i hadn t known about beforehand,a little surprisingly when our guest sat down at the table he told me that he had already had his dinner at home with his wife,roth
1661,1662,it seemed that he had been invited like a medieval bard or a strolling player to tell his story to us while we ate our tell it particularly to me,he was walter herrmann a survivor of two concentration camps who had come to newark in speaking only german fresh from auschwitz and only twentytwo he had somehow found a little money somewhere and with a partner bought a small grocery store just down chancellor avenue from my high school,roth
1663,1664,from there he had gone on to buy the whole building then the building next door and so on until eventually he sold off his extensive newark holdings in the before the bottom began to fall out of the property market into family s business in germany before the became a very rich man,my father knew him from the elizabeth y they used to play cards there when my father could still drive his car and was going to the y three or four times a week,roth
1665,1666,he had invited him to meet me because walter was writing a book about his wartime experience,this was not the first time my father had put an aspiring author in touch with me,roth
1667,1668,it did not matter to him either when i told him that there was absolutely nothing i could do for somebody who was writing say about home mortgages or annuity funds he would then press me for the office telephone number of my editor friends aaron asher or david rieff and bypassing me deal directly with them,some years back one of the manuscripts by a friend of his that he sent to aaron a book about the realestate business went on to be published successfully by harper row aaron s house at the time,roth
1669,1670,my father received a finder s fee and aaron took the two of us out to lunch in manhattan,after that there was no stopping him if there ever had been,roth
1671,1672,while we were all having a drink in the living room before his arrival walter had presented my father with a bottle of remembered that my father had mentioned this friend of his to me a few weeks back when i told him on the phone that my hunter literature class had just been reading a book about borowski s this way for the gas ladies and another about sereny s into that darkness,my duties over the years as a university professor were always a little shadowy to him and every once in a while he would ask me what exactly it was i taught in my classes and i would try to explain,roth
1673,1674,after i told him about the two concentration camp books he said i have a friend from the y who was in auschwitz,he s writing a book himself,roth
1675,1676,wonderful man is he maybe you can help him i have all i can do helping myself with my own books but you could give him some tips dad i don t have any,there are no tips what about aaron asher what about him has he moved again,roth
1677,1678,is he still at that place grove,show him your number he called again to his friend,roth
1679,1680,since it was a warmish night and walter was wearing a shortsleeved light sports jacket he d already removed and draped over the back of his had only to rotate his wrist a little for me to be able to read the numerals on his forearm,my sisterinlaw s parents were holocaust survivors i knew survivors in israel and of course it wasn t unusual to see camp numerals on the arms of all sorts of people one came across in new york,roth
1681,1682,i had also been seated among at least a dozen survivors the year before during the weeks i had attended the trial in jerusalem of john demjanjuk the treblinka guard known as ivan the terrible,probably the survivor whose number had had the greatest impact on me when i saw it was the italian writer primo levi,roth
1683,1684,in i had traveled to turin to do a long interview with him for the new york times and over the course of the four days together we had become mysteriously close close that when my time came to leave primo said i don t know which of us is the younger brother and which is the older brother and we embraced emotionally as though we might never meet again,it turned out that we never did,roth
1685,1686,we had spoken at length about auschwitz about his twelve months there as a young man and the two grave books he d written about the camps and this had become the heart of the interview,it was published in the times s sunday book section just six months before primo levi committed suicide by jumping from the top of the deep stairwell in his turin apartment same stairwell whose five flights of steps i had mounted with such anticipation every day i went there for our talks,roth
1687,1688,i wondered if primo levi and walter herrmann could possibly have met at auschwitz,they would have been about the same age and able to understand each other in that it might improve his chances of surviving primo had worked hard at auschwitz to learn the language of the master race,roth
1689,1690,in what way did walter account for his survival,what had he learned,roth
1691,1692,however amateurish or simply written the book i expected something like that to be its subject,walter held what i took to be a manuscript in a large manila envelope on his lap,roth
1693,1694,during the meal he spoke steadily into my ear about his bourgeois childhood in berlin the dancing classes the latin studies about his mother who had miraculously survived the war and his father whom the nazis had murdered he spoke about his boyhood heine he said kissing the tips of his fingers in let me know how much he had loved the works of franz werfel,then he told me how he had been able to hide for several years in berlin before the nazis caught up with him and sent him first to belsen and then to auschwitz only months before the war ended,roth
1695,1696,in berlin i asked,with women,roth
1697,1698,i was the only man left in berlin,i was eighteen nineteen,roth
1699,1700,all the german men were in the army and all the jewish men were gone,i was hidden by women he smiled impishly,roth
1701,1702,my book is not a book like elie wiesel writes or samuel pisar,elie wiesel is to me a genius,roth
1703,1704,i couldn t write such a tragic book,on the linen tablecloth beside my bouillabaisse bowl he placed a small worn piece of what looked like discolored parchment,roth
1705,1706,it was a muchhandled muchfolded identification paper that the germans had issued to him in the late thirties,i saw that like every other jewish male in the third reich walter herrmann had been given by the aryan authorities the middle name israel a photograph in one corner of the document showed a boy in his late teens slender fulllipped darkish vaguely tartarlooking and no adonis,roth
1707,1708,a resemblance to the man on my right was still there even though the picture was about fifty years old,but where today in his midsixties walter seemed no less confident than any other respectable wealthy jersey businessman the boy he had been back then looked like someone who would have been far more comfortable off in a corner reading franz werfel than as the only male left for the women of berlin,roth
1709,1710,the black hair that grew low on his forehead in the photograph and was styled in what looked like a pompadour had fallen out a week after the war he had lost it overnight he said when he came down with typhus and nearly died following the camp s liberation,this story which he had told about himself barely a minute or two after having been introduced to the family in the living room was my first indication that walter was not one of those survivors who prefer to keep their memories submerged,roth
1711,1712,he had an additional certificate of validation to produce before we got to the manuscript,this as he explained to me was the outer wrapping of a pack of cigarette papers on the inside of which he had penciled a tiny letter from auschwitz to his mother,roth
1713,1714,she had been in hiding somewhere in germany and for such a letter to have reached her would have taken some doing,yet clearly she had got it saved it and brought it with her to america for here it was in new jersey in what could have been a son s last words in,roth
1715,1716,pass em around my father told me and so walter s third reich id card and his twoinchwide auschwitz letter went from me to claire then from claire to seth and ruth who were born respectively in and and who seemed as bemused by the two documents as they were by the loquacious stranger with the number on his arm,they passed them on to lil who said of the picture walter you look like a real yeshiva bucher and she passed them on to my father who said i saw it at the y and he passed them on to practicalminded ingrid who examined each document altogether neutrally as though what she held in her hand had been handed over to her as identification for a check to be cashed,roth
1717,1718,finally the two documents were returned to their owner who slipped them back in the envelope and extracted next still not the pages of manuscript but a series of recent polaroid photographs of his grandchildren at one of their birthday parties,these too made their way around the table and only then did he withdraw from the envelope in a transparent plastic folder some half dozen sample pages from his book and hand them to me,roth
1719,1720,i work on a macintosh he told me,though i could tell that claire was less than captivated by walter s the car on the way home when i asked what she d made of walter she described him as a lurid alone at the table had been following my conversation with him,roth
1721,1722,my father a ringmaster intent on talking simultaneously to everyone was able only to tune in and out on walter and me and the others were no more interested in walter than he was in them,i myself didn t know what to make of him whether he was as forward about his auschwitz past with everyone he met or whether what looked to claire to be exhibitionism hadn t perhaps been galvanized a little by my father s promise of assistance from the writer son who gave his college classes books to read about the concentration camps,roth
1723,1724,i wrote it in german he explained as i removed the pages from the folder,the translation i made myself,roth
1725,1726,but my german by now is not that good and my english when i write is only soso,i am giving it to my daughter to fix the english for me speaking softly to me alone he said i don t know what my daughter will think,roth
1727,1728,she does not know how i survived in berlin,this isn t the way a child thinks of a parent,roth
1729,1730,my member was enormous once again and we had only finished,my fountain of juice flowed into her delicious hole,roth
1731,1732,her lips descended upon my swollen prick,oh do that to me again she said oh beloved again,roth
1733,1734,her dress fell revealing to me tits more magnificent than barbara s and bigger than helen s,i came,roth
1735,1736,she came,it was a delirium,roth
1737,1738,and meanwhile i thought there was a holocaust going on,well phil what do you think my father asked me,roth
1739,1740,at the table everyone was looking my way though no one as earnestly as walter,haven t finished i said,roth
1741,1742,she was starved for a man as only a woman of thirtyfive can be in wartime,she bathed me in her tub,roth
1743,1744,while the water drained i leaned back,as though it were a tencourse meal she fell upon my penis,roth
1745,1746,my son she said my son,i had never been devoured like this before,roth
1747,1748,only katrina had come close to this,look at it she said it is a wonder,roth
1749,1750,i came again,she came again,roth
1751,1752,i came again,on and on,roth
1753,1754,when i had finished all the pages i silently returned them to the folder,i shrugged,roth
1755,1756,walter of course wouldn t have dreamed of showing these pages to my father nor did it occur to my father to ask to read them,was i or was i not interested in books about the holocaust,roth
1757,1758,give it to me walter he said,i ll take care of it with aaron asher,roth
1759,1760,what about david rieff my father said to me,i made a gesture with my two hands that didn t mean a thing accompanied by an agreeable smile,roth
1761,1762,your son is not a man to commit himself walter said politely to my father,yeah he mumbled disgustedly and went back to his ballaboosteh,roth
1763,1764,on the phone just two days later my father said i m going to send you some mail,walter was here this afternoon,roth
1765,1766,he left a photograph and the information,a fulllength sable the softest most weightless sable you ve ever seen and a wonderful shawl collar of summer ermine,roth
1767,1768,i could restyle it for miss bloom and it would be gorgeous it should sell by all rights for well over a hundred thousand walter told us but he would talk to his son and they would come up with an interesting proposition,so special these furs he added that only two such coats were ever made i ll take both i told him,roth
1769,1770,i m afraid that only one is left walter replied,his humorless ardor about giving away at rockbottom this fulllength summer ermine and sable coat the last one in the world and just what we needed made me think of that chapter in survival in auschwitz in which primo levi describes the forbidden bartering and bargaining among the prisoners a ration of bread was the most common unit of currency but everything from a ragged shred of a shirt to the gold teeth in one s mouth was being continuously traded in the corner of the camp farthest from the ss,roth
1771,1772,barracks,could not walter as a young man have been among the most brazen of those auschwitz traders or was the capitalist zeal something he d picked up when he got to america,roth
1773,1774,this is one very mischievous jew,jewish mischief thank god survived the camps too,roth
1775,1776,every page,no kidding he sounded for the moment a little stunned,roth
1777,1778,that s why i didn t say anything when you asked me,i was sitting there having dinner with you all and he gives me this thing and it s pornography i was laughing now and my father joined in,roth
1779,1780,and he just left about half an hour ago my father said,his daughter is editing it my father said,roth
1781,1782,i don t like it because you become accustomed to it,it helped,roth
1783,1784,i don t have to hold on to abe,the old comedians,roth
1785,1786,the howard brothers,lou holtz,roth
1787,1788,cantor,benny,roth
1789,1790,and we sing songs together,abe likes that,roth
1791,1792,you remember lou holtz,i ve often wondered,roth
1793,1794,i always say it to claire but i never knew who the comedian was,he s before my time lou holtz,roth
1795,1796,we talk about harry lauder,then i sing a song to him about harry lauder and abe joins in,roth
1797,1798,that s how we walk up and down every day,abe loved harry lauder,roth
1799,1800,the scotch comedian,i used to watch him when i went to the palace in newark,roth
1801,1802,he used to come out and sing this one song,i forget it now that i have to remember,roth
1803,1804,he used to come out with a bent cane and he used to sing this scottish song,abe loves that song,roth
1805,1806,he always sings it,he can take care of himself,roth
1807,1808,you believe that stuff,even with the new fourpronged cane it was now downright dangerous for him to try to move about the apartment on his own let alone to walk outside anymore,roth
1809,1810,the arminarm singalongs with abe abruptly came to an end and then intermittently he began to develop trouble when he swallowed coughing and choking particularly hard while trying to get down liquids,he associated these difficulties with a lingering cold when in fact the enlarging tumor had begun to interfere with the part of the brain that controls the swallowing mechanism,roth
1811,1812,unlike my father i wasn t unprepared for this since a little more than a year before dr,benjamin had warned i d said no at the hospital to the brain the swallowing was likely to be affected next,roth
1813,1814,i got in touch with dr,wasserman to ask what if anything could be done for him,roth
1815,1816,some tests were ordered and they confirmed that he had begun to aspirate what he ate and was in danger of contracting bronchial pneumonia by this taking of food or drink into his lungs through his windpipe,it would be better harold wasserman suggested to me if he didn t eat when i by his that could possibly mean harold explained how the danger of pneumonia could be circumvented by inserting a tube into my father s stomach and feeding him that way,roth
1817,1818,a gastrostomy it was called,and what does he do with his saliva i asked,roth
1819,1820,spits it out i was told,it s beginning to get horrible i told my brother and for the next few weeks he and i let our father go along blaming his new problem on the cold until the difficulty got dramatically we were assured that it would soon would not depress him further by explaining to him the real source of his trouble,roth
1821,1822,he seemed himself to sense that something serious was up however because when i asked on the phone if eating had gotten any easier he began to deny that it had ever become hard,it s just that i can t drink sweet liquids it s just if the food is too hot and so on,roth
1823,1824,i bring up phlegm he said because of my cold,i m not having any operation on my throat nobody s proposing an operation,roth
1825,1826,but you do seem to have a little swallowing problem i don t,despite my worries about my father i hadn t felt healthier in years and nearing the end of the revisions of deception the new novel was the sweet relief that finishing a book always is,roth
1827,1828,but early in august when i went to take my afternoon swim one day something unexpected happened only this time not to my father but to just one easy lap my head was splitting my heart was pounding madly and i could barely catch my breath,clinging to the edge of the pool i told myself it s anxiety,roth
1829,1830,what are you so anxious about sort of question that people in physical trouble had the sense not to bother about before the advent of the psychosomologists,what lay in store for my father had debilitated more than just my morale i felt dreadful i told myself because his months and months of misery with the brain tumor were to culminate now in having a feeding tube inserted permanently into his stomach,roth
1831,1832,my diagnosis was wrong,i felt dreadful after only one lap because over the course of fiftysix years virtually every major artery to my heart had become eighty to a hundred percent occluded and i was not far from a huge heart attack,roth
1833,1834,twentyfour hours after i climbed out of the swimming pool gasping for air i was saved from the heart from preceding my father to the he was spared having to bury an emergency quintuple bypass operation,at am,roth
1835,1836,on the night before the surgery when the symptoms took an alarming turn and some halfdozen interns residents and nurses began circling busily around the instruments monitoring my worsening condition a call went out to the surgeon to see if he wanted to change his plans and operate immediately,i realized that never had i been more at one with my father than i was at that moment not since college when i used to smuggle him secretly into class with me the intellectual homunculus for whose development i felt as responsible as i did for my own had our lives been if not identical so intermeshed and spookily interchangeable,roth
1837,1838,helpless at the center of this little medical hubbub i confronted with a clarifying shock the inevitability in which for him every second of existence was awash now,the difference of course was that after the surgery i felt once reborn and as though i had given birth,roth
1839,1840,my heart which for any number of years prior to the operation had apparently been performing on as little as twenty percent of its normal blood supply was being permeated by all the blood it could want,i would smile to myself in the hospital bed at night envisioning my heart as a tiny infant suckling itself on this blood coursing unobstructed now through the newly attached arteries borrowed from my leg,roth
1841,1842,this i thought is what the thrill must be like nursing one s own strident drumlike postoperative heartbeat was not mine but its,so that the night nurse couldn t hear i whispered to that baby just under my breath suck yes suck suck away it s yours all yours for you and never in my life had i been happier,roth
1843,1844,i don t know how much of that recurrent fantasy and its accompanying litany was a consequence of the euphoria of having had my life saved and how much was the lingering aftereffect of five hours under heavy anesthesia but during those first few nights when the pain in my chest wall made continuous sleep impossible the thought that i was giving suck to my own newborn heart provided hours of the most intense pleasure sessions during which i did not have to use any imagination at all to feel myself androgynously partaking of the most delirious maternal joy,it strikes me now looking back that in the exuberant reveries of those first postoperative nights i was as near to being the double of my own nurturing mother as during the anxious uncertain hours on the eve of the bypass i had come to feeling myself transposed interchangeable a sacrificial proxy failing father choking on his mortality at the dinner table,roth
1845,1846,i was never a heart patient alone in that bed i was a family of four,and suddenly like a crewcut proteus rising from the sea ron patimkin emerged from the lower depths we d just inhabited and his immensity was before us,roth
1847,1848,hey bren he said and pushed a palm flat into the water so that a small hurricane beat up against brenda and me,what are you so happy about she said,roth
1849,1850,no ronald,i treaded unobtrusively as i could as a third party unintroduced will step back and say nothing awaiting the amenities,roth
1851,1852,i was tired however from the afternoon s sport and wished to hell brother and sister would not tease and chat much longer,fortunately brenda introduced me,roth
1853,1854,ronald this is neil klugman,i returned the shake not quite as monumentally as he apparently expected my chin slipped an inch into the water and all at once i was exhausted,roth
1855,1856,want to race ron asked me goodnaturedly,go ahead neil race with him,roth
1857,1858,ill have to call my aunt,you didn t say anything,roth
1859,1860,swim baby brenda said to him and it ached me some when she kissed him on the face,i begged out of the race saying i had to make a phone call myself and once upon the tiled blue border of the pool looked back to see ron taking the length in sleek immense strokes,roth
1861,1862,he gave one the feeling that after swimming the length of the pool a half dozen times he would have earned the right to drink its contents i imagined he had like my uncle max a colossal thirst and a gigantic bladder,aunt gladys did not seem relieved when i told her she d have only three feedings to prepare that night,roth
1863,1864,fancyshmancy was all she said to me on the phone,we did not eat in the kitchen rather the six of myself ron mr,roth
1865,1866,and mrs,patimkin and brenda s little sister around the dining room table while the maid carlota a navahofaced negro who had little holes in her ears but no earrings served us the meal,roth
1867,1868,i was seated next to brenda who was dressed in what was au naturel for her bermudas the close ones white polo shirt tennis sneakers and white socks,across from me was julie ten roundfaced bright who before dinner while the other little girls on the street had been playing with jacks and boys and each other had been on the back lawn putting golf balls with her father,roth
1869,1870,mr,patimkin reminded me of my father except that when he spoke he did not surround each syllable with a wheeze,roth
1871,1872,he was tall strong ungrammatical and a ferocious eater,when he attacked his drenching it in bottled french veins swelled under the heavy skin of his forearm,roth
1873,1874,he ate three helpings of salad ron had four brenda and julie had two and only mrs,patimkin and i had one each,roth
1875,1876,i did not like mrs,patimkin though she was certainly the handsomest of all of us at the table,roth
1877,1878,she was disastrously polite to me and with her purple eyes her dark hair and large persuasive frame she gave me the feeling of some captive beauty some wild princess who has been tamed and made the servant to the king s was brenda,outside through the wide picture window i could see the back lawn with its twin oak trees,roth
1879,1880,i say oaks though fancifully one might call them sportinggoods trees,beneath their branches like fruit dropped from their limbs were two irons a golf ball a tennis can a baseball bat basketball a firstbaseman s glove and what was apparently a riding crop,roth
1881,1882,further back near the scrubs that bounded the patimkin property and in front of the small basketball court a square red blanket with a white o stitched in the center looked to be on fire against the green grass,a breeze must have blown outside for the net on the basket moved inside we ate in the steady coolness of air by westinghouse,roth
1883,1884,it was a pleasure except that eating among those brobdingnags i felt for quite a while as though four inches had been clipped from my shoulders three inches from my height and for good measure someone had removed my ribs and my chest had settled meekly in towards my back,there was not much dinner conversation eating was heavy and methodical and serious and it would be just as well to record all that was said in one swoop rather than indicate the sentences lost in the passing of food the words gurgled into mouthfuls the syntax chopped and forgotten in heapings spillings and gorgings,roth
1885,1886,to ron when s harriet calling,ron five o clock,roth
1887,1888,julie it was five o clock,ron their time,roth

1965,1966,mr,p what s this she business,roth
1967,1968,is that how you call your mother,what s dessert,roth
1969,1970,the phone rings and though we are awaiting dessert the meal seems at a formal end for ron breaks for his room julie shouts harriet and mr,patimkin is not wholly successful in stifling a belch though the failure even more than the effort ingratiates him to me,roth
1971,1972,mrs,patimkin is directing carlota not to mix the milk silverware and the meat silverware again and carlota is eating a peach while she listens under the table i feel brenda s fingers tease my calf,roth
1973,1974,i am full,we sat under the biggest of the oak trees while out on the basketball court mr,roth
1975,1976,patimkin played five and two with julie,in the driveway ron was racing the motor of the volkswagen,roth
1977,1978,will somebody please move the chrysler out from behind me he called angrily,i think i m behind the chrysler i said,roth
1979,1980,let s go she said,we backed the cars out so that ron could hasten on to his game,roth
1981,1982,then we reparked them and went back to watching mr,patimkin and julie,roth
1983,1984,i like your sister i said,so do i she said,roth
1985,1986,i don t know she said,better probably and then she added or maybe worse,roth
1987,1988,how can you tell,my father s nice to her but i ll give her another three years with my mother bill she said musingly,roth
1989,1990,i didn t mind that i said,she hates me,roth
1991,1992,other girls when they pack in september at least their mothers help them,not mine,roth
1993,1994,she ll be busy sharpening pencils for julie s pencil box while i m carrying my trunk around upstairs,and it s so obvious why,roth
1995,1996,it s so corny i m ashamed to say it,do you know my mother had the best backhand in new jersey,roth
1997,1998,really she was the best tennis player in the state man or woman,you ought to see the pictures of her when she was a girl,roth
1999,2000,she was so healthylooking,but not chubby or anything,roth
2001,2002,she was soulful truly,i love her in those pictures,roth
2003,2004,sometimes i say to her how beautiful the pictures are,i even asked to have one blown up so i could have it at school,roth
2005,2006,we have other things to do with our money young lady than spend it on old photographs money,my father s up to here with it but whenever i buy a coat you should hear her,roth
2007,2008,you don t have to go to bonwit s young lady ohrbach s has the strongest fabrics of any of them who wants a strong fabric,finally i get what i want but not till she s had a chance to aggravate me,roth
2009,2010,money is a waste for her,she doesn t even know how to enjoy it,roth
2011,2012,yes,him and she pointed out to mr,roth
2013,2014,patimkin who had just swished his third straight set shot through the basket to the disgruntlement apparently of julie who stamped so hard at the ground that she raised a little dust storm around her perfect young legs,he s not too smart but he s sweet at least,roth
2015,2016,he doesn t treat my brother the way she treats me,thank god for that,roth
2017,2018,oh i m tired of talking about them,since my freshman year i think every conversation i ve ever had has always wound up about my parents and how awful it is,roth
2019,2020,it s universal,patimkin while i sat beside brenda but i could not shake from my elephant s brain that shestill thinksweliveinnewark remark,roth
2021,2022,i did not speak however fearful that my tone would shatter our postdinner ease and intimacy,it had been so simple to be intimate with water pounding and securing all our pores and later with the sun heating them and drugging our senses but now in the shade and the open cool and clothed on her own grounds i did not want to voice a word that would lift the cover and reveal that hideous emotion i always felt for her and is the underside of love,roth
2023,2024,it will not always stay the i am skipping ahead,suddenly little julie was upon us,roth
2025,2026,want to play she said to me,patimkin called,roth
2027,2028,patimkin tossed the ball towards me while i wasn t looking and it bounced off my chest leaving a round dust spot like the shadow of a moon on my shirt,i laughed insanely,roth
2029,2030,can t you catch julie said,like her sister she seemed to have a knack for asking practical infuriating questions,roth
2031,2032,daddy s behind fortyseven to thirtynine,shoot mr,roth
2033,2034,patimkin said,with the lord s blessing and a soft breeze i made the layup,roth
2035,2036,you have fortyone,i go julie said,roth
2037,2038,mr,patimkin sat on the grass at the far end of the court,roth
2039,2040,he took his shirt off and in his undershirt and his whole day s growth of beard looked like a trucker,brenda s old nose fitted him well,roth
2041,2042,there was a bump in it all right up at the bridge it seemed as though a small eightsided diamond had been squeezed in under the skin,i knew mr,roth
2043,2044,patimkin would never bother to have that stone cut from his face and yet with joy and pride no doubt had paid to have brenda s diamond removed and dropped down some toilet in fifth avenue hospital,julie missed her set shot and i admit to a slight gay flutter of heart,roth
2045,2046,put a little spin on it mr,patimkin told her,roth
2047,2048,can i take it again julie asked me,yes what with paternal directions from the sidelines and my own grudging graciousness on the court there did not seem much of a chance for me to catch up,roth
2049,2050,and i wanted to suddenly i wanted to win to run little julie into the ground,brenda was back on one elbow under the tree chewing on a leaf watching,roth
2051,2052,and up in the house at the kitchen window i could see that the curtain had swished sun too low now to glare off electrical mrs,patimkin was looking steadily out at the game,roth
2053,2054,and then carlota appeared on the back steps eating a peach and holding a pail of garbage in her free hand,she stopped to watch too,roth
2055,2056,it was my turn again,over the years mr,roth
2057,2058,patimkin had taught his daughters that free throws were theirs for the asking he could afford to,however with the strange eyes of short hills upon me matrons servants and providers i somehow felt i couldn t,roth
2059,2060,but i had to and i did,thanks a lot neil julie said when the game was the crickets had come,roth
2061,2062,since i was twenty minutes early i decided to stroll in the park rather than cross over to work i didn t particularly care to join my colleagues who i knew would be sipping early morning coffee in the binding room smelling still of all the orange crush they d drunk that weekend at asbury park,i sat on a bench and looked out towards broad street and the morning traffic,roth
2063,2064,the lackawanna commuter trains were rambling in a few blocks to the north and i could hear them i sunny green cars old and clean with windows that opened all the way,some mornings with time to kill before work i would walk down to the tracks and watch the open windows roll in on their sills the elbows of tropical suits and the edges of briefcases the properties of businessmen arriving in town from maplewood the oranges and the suburbs beyond,roth
2065,2066,the park bordered by washington street on the west and broad on the east was empty and shady and smelled of trees night and dog leavings and there was a faint damp smell too indicating that the huge rhino of a water cleaner had passed by already soaking and whisking the downtown streets,down washington street behind me was the newark could see it without even looking two oriental vases in front like spittoons for a rajah and next to it the little annex to which we had traveled on special buses as schoolchildren,roth
2067,2068,the annex was a brick building old and vinecovered and always reminded me of new jersey s link with the beginning of the country with george washington who had trained his scrappy little bronze tablet informed us the very park where i now sat,at the far end of the park beyond the museum was the bank building where i had gone to college,roth
2069,2070,it had been converted some years before into extension of rutgers university in fact in what once had been the bank president s waiting room i had taken a course called contemporary moral issues,though it summer now nnd i was out of college three years it not hard for me to remember the other students my friends who had worked evenings in bamberger s and kresge s and had used the commissions they d earned pushing ladies outofseason shoes to pay their laboratory fees,roth
2071,2072,and then i looked out to broad street again,jammed between a grimywindowed bookstore and a cheesy luncheonette was the marquee of a tiny art many years had passed since i d stood beneath that marquee lying about the year of my birth so as to see hedy lamarr swim naked in ecstasy and then having slipped the ticket taker an extra quarter what disappointment i had felt at the frugality of her slavic charm sitting there in the park i felt a deep knowledge of newark an attachment so rooted that it could not help but branch out into affection,roth
2073,2074,suddenly it was nine o clock and everything was scurrying,wobblyheeled girls revolved through the doors of the telephone building across the way traffic honked desperately policeman barked whistled and waved motorists to and fro,roth
2075,2076,over at st,vincent s church the huge dark portals swung back and those blearyeyes that had risen early for mass now blinked at the light,roth
2077,2078,then the worshipers had stepped off the church steps and were racing down the streets towards desks riling cabinets secretaries bosses the lord had seen fit to remove a mite of harshness from their the comfort of airconditioners pumping at their windows,i got up and crossed over to the library wondering if brenda was awake yet,roth
2079,2080,the pale cement lions stood unconvincing guard on the library steps suffering their usual combination of elephantiasis and arteriosclerosis and i was prepared to pay them as little attention as i had for the past eight months were it not for a small colored boy who stood in front of one of them,the lion had lost all of its toes the summer before to a safari of juvenile delinquents and now a new tormentor stood before him sagging a little in his knees and growling,roth
2081,2082,he would growl low and long drop back wait then growl again,then he would straighten up and shaking his head he would say to the lion man you s a coward then once again he d growl,roth
2083,2084,the day began the same as any other,from behind the desk on the main floor i watched the hot highbreasted teenage girls walk twitchingly up the wide flight of marble stairs that led to the main reading room,roth
2085,2086,the stairs were an imitation of a staircase somewhere in versailles though in their toreador pants and sweaters these young daughters of italian leatherworkers polish brewery hands and jewish furriers were hardly duchesses,they were not brenda either and any lust that sparked inside me through the dreary day was academic and timepassing,roth
2087,2088,i looked at my watch occasionally thought of brenda and waited for lunch and then for after lunch when i would take over the information desk upstairs and john mckee who was only twentyone but wore elastic bands around his sleeves would march starchily down the stairs to work assiduously at stamping books in and out,john mcrubberbands was in his last year at newark state teachers college where he was studying at the dewey decimal system in preparation for his lifework,roth
2089,2090,the library was not going to be my lif ework i knew it,yet there had been some mr,roth
2091,2092,scapello an old eunuch who had learned somehow to disguise his voice as a man when i returned from my summer vacation i would be put in charge of the reference room a position that had been empty ever since that morning when martha winney had fallen off a high stool in the encyclopedia room and shattered all those frail bones that come together to form what in a woman half her age we would call the hips,i had strange fellows at the library and in truth there were many hours when i never quite knew how i d gotten there or why i stayed,roth
2093,2094,but i did stay and after a while waited patiently for that day when i would go into the men s room on the main floor for a cigarette and studying myself as i expelled smoke into the mirror would see that at some moment during the morning i had gone pale and that under my skin as under mckee s and scapello s and miss winney s there was a thin cushion of air separating the blood from the flesh,someone had pumped it there while i was stamping out a book and so life from now on would be not a throwing off as it was for aunt gladys and not a gathering in as it was for brenda but a bouncing off a numbness i began to fear this and yet in my muscleless devotion to my work seemed edging towards it silently as miss winney used to edge up to the britannica,roth
2095,2096,her stool was empty now and awaited me,just before lunch the lion tamer came wideeyed into the library,roth
2097,2098,he stood still for a moment only his fingers moving as though he were counting the number of marble stairs before him,then he walked creepily about on the marble floor snickering at the clink of his taps and the way his little noise swelled up to the vaulted ceiling,roth
2099,2100,otto the guard at the door told him to make less noise with his shoes but that did not seem to bother the little boy,he clacked on his tiptoes high secretively delighted at the opportunity otto had given him to practice this posture,roth
2101,2102,he tiptoed up to me,the heart section,roth
2103,2104,how do you spell it i said,heart,roth
2105,2106,man pictures,drawing books,roth
2107,2108,he started backing away as he had from the lion,all of them he mumbled,roth
2109,2110,that s okay i said,you go look at whichever ones you want,roth
2111,2112,the next flight up,follow the arrow to where it says stack three,roth
2113,2114,you remember that,stack three,roth
2115,2116,after lunch i came back to the inandout desk and there was john mckee waiting in his pale blue slacks his black shoes his barbercloth shirt with the elastic bands and a great knit tie green wrapped into a windsor knot that was huge and jumped when he talked,his breath smelled of hair oil and his hair of breath and when he spoke spittle cobwebbed the comers of his mouth,roth
2117,2118,i did not like him and at times had the urge to yank back on his armbands and slingshoot him out past otto and the lions into the street,has a little negro boy passed the desk,roth
2119,2120,with a thick accent,he s been hiding in the art books all morning,roth
2121,2122,someone should check on him,i was afraid to leave the desk here,roth
2123,2124,have you seen what they do at seth boyden,they threw beer bottles those big ones on the lawn,roth
2125,2126,i m going to call mr,scapello s office to check the art section,roth
2127,2128,scapello an ulcer so soon after his eggandpepper sandwich,scapello would not descend upon the boy with his chalky fingers i walked up the three flights to stack three past the receiving room where rheumyeyed jimmy boylen our fiftyoneyearold boy unloaded books from a cart past the reading room where bums off mulberry street slept over popular mechanics past the smoking corridor where dampbrowed summer students from the law school relaxed some smoking others trying to rub the colored dye from their tort texts off their fingertips and finally past the periodical room where a few ancient ladies who d been motored down from upper montclair now huddled in their chairs pincenezing over yellowed fraying society pages in old old copies of the newark news,roth
2129,2130,up on stack three i found the boy,he was seated on the glassbrick floor holding an open book in his lap a book in fact that was bigger than his lap and had to be propped up by his knees,roth
2131,2132,by the light of the window behind him i could see the hundreds of spaces between the hundreds of tiny black corkscrews that were his hair,he was very black and shiny and the flesh of his lips did not so much appear to be a different color as it looked to be unfinished and awaiting another coat the lips were parted the eves wide and even the ears seemed to have a heightened receptivity,roth
2133,2134,he looked he saw me that is,for all he knew i was john mckee,roth
2135,2136,that s okay i said before he could even move i m just passing through,these people man they sure does look cool,roth
2137,2138,it was an expensive largesized edition of gauguin reproductions,the page he had been looking at showed an print in color of three native women standing kneehigh in a rosecolored stream,roth
2139,2140,it was a silent picture he was right,that s tahiti,roth
2141,2142,it s very far,man the boy said that s the fuckin life the euphoria of his diction would have earned him eternal banishment from the newark public library and its branches had john or mr,roth
2143,2144,god forbid the hospitalized miss to investigate,who took these pictures he asked me,roth
2145,2146,gauguin,he didn t take them he painted them,roth
2147,2148,paul gauguin,he don t take pictures like no colored men would,roth
2149,2150,he s a good picture taker look look look here at this one,later i sent jimmy boylen hopping down the stairs to tell mckee that everything was all right,roth
2151,2152,the rest of the day was uneventful,i sat at the information desk thinking about brenda and reminding myself that that evening i would have to get gas before i started up to short hills which i could see now in my mind s eye at dusk rosecolored like a gauguin stream,roth
2153,2154,when i pulled up to the patimkin house that night everybody but julie was waiting for me on the front porch mr,and mrs ron and brenda wearing a dress,roth
2155,2156,i had not seen her in a dress before and for an instant she did not look like the same girl,but that was only half the surprise,roth
2157,2158,so many of those lincolnesque college girls turn out to be limbed for shorts alone,not brenda,roth
2159,2160,she looked in a dress as though she d gone through life so attired as though she d never worn shorts or bathing suits or pajamas or anything but that pale linen dress,i walked rather bouncingly up the lawn past the huge weeping willow towards the waiting patimkins wishing all the while that i d had my car washed,roth
2161,2162,before i d even reached them ron stepped forward and shook my hand vigorously as though he hadn t seen me since the diaspora,mrs,roth
2163,2164,patimkin smiled and mr,patimkin grunted something and continued twitching his wrists before him then raising an imaginary golf club and driving a ghost of a golf ball up and away towards the orange mountains that are called orange i m convinced because in that various suburban light that s the only color they do not come dressed in,roth
2165,2166,we ll be right back brenda said to me,you have to sit with julie,roth
2167,2168,she says ron pushed her in the pool this afternoon,we ve been waiting for you so we don t miss ron s plane,roth
2169,2170,and mrs,patimkin and ron moved off and i flashed brenda just the hint of a glare,roth
2171,2172,she reached out and took my hand a moment,how do you like me she said,roth
2173,2174,you re great to babysit for,we ll be right back then she waited a moment and when i failed to deflate the pout from my mouth she gave me a glare no hints about it,roth
2175,2176,i meant how do you like me in a dress then she ran off towards the chrysler trotting in her high heels like a colt,when i walked into the house i slammed the screen door behind me,roth
2177,2178,close the other door too a little voice shouted,neil julie called,roth
2179,2180,i m in the television room she called,nothing honey,roth
2181,2182,for a while i remained in the hall bitten with the urge to slide quietly out of the house into my car and back to newark where i might even sit in the alley and break candy with my own,i felt like carlota no not even as comfortable as that,roth
2183,2184,at last i left the hall and began to stroll in and out of rooms on the first floor,next to the living room was the study a small knottypine room jammed with eatercornered leather chairs and a complete set of information please almanacs,roth
2185,2186,on the wall hung three colored photopaintings they were the kind which regardless of the subjects be they vital or infirm old or youthful are characterized by budcheeks wet lips pearly teeth and shiny metallized hair,the subjects in this case were ron brenda and julie at about ages fourteen thirteen and two,roth
2187,2188,brenda had long auburn hair her diamondstudded nose and no glasses all combined to make her look a regal thirteenyearold who d just gotten smoke in her eyes,ron was rounder and his hairline was lower but that love of spherical objects and lined courts twinkled in his boyish eves poor little tulie was lost in the photopainter s platonic idea of childhood her tiny humanity was smothered somewhere back of gobs of pink and white,roth
2189,2190,there were other pictures about smaller ones taken with a brownie reflex before photopaintings had become fashionable,there was a tiny picture of brenda on a horse another of ron in bar mitzvah suit yamdkah and tallas and two pictures framed of a beautiful faded woman who must have been from the eyes mrs,roth
2191,2192,patimkin s mother and the other of mrs,patimkin herself her hair in a halo her eyes joyous and not those of a slowly aging mother with a quick and lovely daughter,roth
2193,2194,i walked through the archway into the dining room and stood a moment looking out at the sporting goods tree,from the television room that winged off the dining room i could hear julie listening to this is your life,roth
2195,2196,the kitchen which winged off the other side was empty and apparently with carlota off the patimkins had had dinner at the club,mr,roth
2197,2198,and mrs,patimkin s bedroom was in the middle of the house down the hall next to julie s and for a moment i wanted to see what size bed those giants slept imagined it wide and deep as a swimming i postponed my investigation while julie was in the house and instead opened the door in the kitchen that led down to the basement,roth
2199,2200,the basement had a different kind of coolness from the house and it had a smell which was something the upstairs was totally without,it felt cavernous down there but in a comforting way like the simulated caves children make for themselves on rainy days in hall closets under blankets or in between the legs of dining room tables,roth
2201,2202,i flipped on the light at the foot of the stairs and was not surprised at the pine paneling the bamboo furniture the pingpong table and the mirrored bar that was stocked with every kind and size of glass ice bucket decanter mixer swizzle stick shot glass pretzel the bacchanalian paraphernalia plentiful orderly and untouched as it can be only in the bar of a wealthy man who never entertains drinking people who himself does not drink who in fact gets a fishy look from his wife when every several months he takes a shot of schnapps before dinner,i went behind the bar where there was an aluminum sink that had not seen a dirty glass i m sure since ron s bar mitzvah party and would not see another probably until one of the patimkin children was married or engaged,roth
2203,2204,i would have poured myself a as a wicked wage for being forced into i was uneasy about breaking the label on a bottle of whiskey,you had to break a label to get a drink,roth
2205,2206,on the shelf back of the bar were two dozen to be jack daniels each with a little booklet tied to its collared neck informing patrons how patrician of them it was to drink the stuff,and over the jack daniels were more photos there was a blownup newspaper photo of ron palming a basketball in one hand like a raisin under the picture it said center ronald patimkin millburn high school pounds and there was another picture of brenda on a horse and next to that a velvet mounting board with ribbons and medals clipped to it essex county horse show union county horse show garden state fair morristown horse show and so for brenda for jumping and running or galloping or whatever else young girls receive ribbons for,roth
2207,2208,in the entire house i had nt seen one picture of mr,patimkin,roth
2209,2210,the rest of the basement back of the wide pinepaneled room was gray cement walls and linoleum floor and contained innumerable electrical appliances including a freezer big enough to house a family of eskimos,beside the freezer incongruosly was a tall old refrigerator its ancient presence was a reminder to me of the patimkin roots in newark,roth
2211,2212,this same refrigerator had once stood in the kitchen of an apartment in some fourfamily house probably in the same neighborhood where i had lived all my life first with my parents and then when the two of them went wheezing off to arizona with my aunt and uncle,after pearl harbor the refrigerator had made the move up to short hills patimkin kitchen and bathroom sinks had gone to war no new barracks was complete until it had a squad of patimkin sinks lined up in its latrine,roth
2213,2214,i opened the door of the old refrigerator it was not empty,no longer did it hold butter eggs herring in cream sauce ginger ale tuna fish salad an occasional it was heaped with fruit shelves swelled with it every color every texture and hidden within every kind of pit,roth
2215,2216,there were greengage plums black plums red plums apricots nectarines peaches long horns of grapes black yellow red and cherries cherries flowing out of boxes and staining everything scarlet,and there were and on the top shelf half of a huge watermelon a thin sheet of wax paper clinging to its bare red face like a wet lip,roth
2217,2218,oh patimkin,fruit grew in their refrigerator and sporting goods dropped from their trees,roth
2219,2220,i grabbed a handful of cherries and then a nectarine and i bit right down to its pit,she was wearing her bermudas and her white polo shirt which was unlike brenda s only in that it had a little dietary history of its own,roth
2221,2222,what i said,they re not washed yet julie said and in such a way that it seemed to place the refrigerator itself outofbounds if only for me,roth
2223,2224,that s all right i said and devoured the nectarine and put the pit in my pocket and stepped out of the refrigerator room all in one second,i still didn t know what to do with the cherries,roth
2225,2226,i was just looking around i said,julie didn t answer,roth
2227,2228,where s ron going i asked dropping the cherries into my pocket among my keys and change,harriet i asked,roth
2229,2230,i brought them around to the front and i swear it she did peek to see if they were empty,we confronted one another again she seemed to have a threat in her face,roth
2231,2232,then she spoke,i have no excuses to offer for what happened next,roth
2233,2234,i began to win and i liked it,can i take that one over julie said,roth
2235,2236,that wasn t fair neil,my shoelace came untied,roth
2237,2238,neil you leaned over the table,neil you gypped me out of a point,roth
2239,2240,you re a cheater she screamed at me,you cheat her jaw was trembling as though she carried a weight on top of her pretty head,roth
2241,2242,i hate you and she threw her racket across the room and it clanged off the bar just as outside i heard the chrysler crushing gravel in the driveway,the game isn t over i said to her,roth
2243,2244,you cheat,and you were stealing fruit she said and ran away before i had my chance to win,roth
2245,2246,later that night brenda and i made love our first time,we were sitting on the sofa in the television room and for some ten minutes had not spoken a word to each other,roth
2247,2248,julie had long since gone to a weepy bed and though no one had said anything to me about her crying i did not know if the child had mentioned my fistful of cherries which some time before i had flushed down the toilet,the television set was on and though the sound was off and the house quiet the gray pictures still wiggled at the far end of the room,roth
2249,2250,brenda was quiet and her dress circled her legs which were tucked back beneath her,we sat there for some while and did not speak,roth
2251,2252,then she went into the kitchen and when she came back she said that it sounded as though everyone was asleep,we sat a while longer watching the soundless bodies on the screen eating a silent dinner in someone s silent restaurant,roth
2253,2254,when i began to unbutton her dress she resisted me and i like to think it was because she knew how lovely she looked in it,but she looked lovely my brenda anyway and we folded it carefully and held each other close and soon there we were brenda falling slowly but with a smile and me rising,roth
2255,2256,how can i describe loving brenda,it was so sweet as though i d finally scored that twentyfirst point,roth
2257,2258,when i got home i dialed brenda s number but not before my aunt heard and rose from her bed,who are you calling at this hour,roth
2259,2260,he tells me shhh,phone calls one o clock at night we haven t got a big enough bill and then she dragged herself back into the bed where with a martyr s heart and bleary eyes she had resisted the downward tug of sleep until she d heard my key in the door,roth
2261,2262,brenda answered the phone,neil she said,roth
2263,2264,yes i whispered,i m in bed with you she said,roth
2265,2266,go to sleep sweet i m here and we hung up without goodbyes,in the morning as planned i called again but i could hardly hear brenda or myself for that matter for aunt gladys and uncle max were going on a workmen s circle picnic in the afternoon and there was some trouble about grape juice that had dripped all night from a jug in the refrigerator and by morning had leaked out onto the floor,roth
2267,2268,brenda was still in bed and so could play our game with some success but i had to pull down all the shades of my senses to imagine myself beside her,i could only pray our nights and mornings would come and soon enough they did,roth
2269,2270,every morning before the library opened the boy was waiting sometimes he seated himself on the lion s back sometimes under his belly sometimes he just stood around throwing pebbles at his mane,then he would come inside tap around the main floor until otto stared him up on tiptoes and finally headed up the long marble stairs that led to tahiti,roth
2271,2272,he did not always stay to lunch time but one very hot day he was there when i arrived in the morning and went through the door behind me when i left at night,the next morning it was that he did not show up and as though in his place a very old man appeared white smelling of life savers his nose and jowls showing erupted veins beneath them,roth
2273,2274,in a few minutes he returned with a big browncovered book in his hand,he placed it on my desk withdrew his card from a long moneyless billfold and waited for me to stamp out the book,roth
2275,2276,do you want to take this book out i said,he smiled,roth
2277,2278,i took his card and jammed the metal edge into the machine but i did not stamp down,just a minute i said,roth
2279,2280,i took a clipboard from under the desk and flipped through a few pages upon which were games of battleship and ticktacktoe that i d been playing through the week with myself,someone s called up and asked that we hold it for them,roth
2281,2282,when the colored kid showed up later in the day it was just where he d left it the afternoon before,as for brenda i saw her every evening and when there was not a night game that kept mr,roth
2283,2284,patimkin awake and in the tv room or a hadassah card party that sent mrs,patimkin out of the house and brought her in at unpredictable hours we made love before the silent screen,roth
2285,2286,one muggy lowskied night brenda took me swimming at the club,we were the only ones in the pool and all the chairs the cabanas the lights the diving boards the very water seemed to exist only for our pleasure,roth
2287,2288,she wore a blue suit that looked purple in the lights and down beneath the water it flashed sometimes green sometimes black,late in the evening a breeze came up off the golf course and we wrapped ourselves in one huge towel pulled two chaise longues together and despite the bartender who was doing considerable pacing back and forth by the bar window which overlooked the pool we rested side by side on the chairs,roth
2289,2290,finally the bar light itself flipped off and then in a snap the lights around the pool went down and out,my heart must have beat faster or something for brenda seemed to guess my sudden should go i thought,roth
2291,2292,i pushed the straps of her bathing suit down but she said no and rolled an inch away from me and for the first time in the two weeks i d known her she asked me a question about me,where are your parents she said,roth
2293,2294,tucson i said,why are you still here,roth
2295,2296,why aren t you with them she asked,i m not a child any more brenda i said more sharply than i d intended,roth
2297,2298,worse,it s convenient from there and it s cheap and it pleases my parents,roth
2299,2300,i want to know,and me she said finally,roth
2301,2302,well what about it,do i like it,roth
2303,2304,it s okay,i sold shoes once and like the library better,roth
2305,2306,i am twentythree years old,i haven t planned a thing in three years,roth
2307,2308,at least for the year i ve been out of the army,in the army i used to plan to go away weekends,roth
2309,2310,i m not a planner after all the truth i d suddenly given her i shouldn t have ruined it for myself with that final lie,do you love me neil,roth
2311,2312,i did not answer,do you she said,roth
2313,2314,was it obtuseness again,i know you will she said,roth
2315,2316,why don t you go in the water and i ll wait for you and close my eyes and when you come back you ll surprise me with the wet,the water felt colder than it had earlier and when i broke through and was headed blindly down i felt a touch of panic,roth
2317,2318,at the top again i started to swim the length of the pool and then turned at the end and started back but suddenly i was sure that when i left the water brenda would be gone,i d be alone in this damn place,roth
2319,2320,i started for the side and pulled myself up and ran to the chairs and brenda was there and i kissed her,nothing for quite a while,roth
2321,2322,bren i called softly are you all right but no one answered,i found her glasses on the chair beside me and held them in my hands,roth
2323,2324,your turn she said,this time i stayed below the water for a long while and when i surfaced again my lungs were ready to pop,roth
2325,2326,i threw my head back for air and above me saw the sky low like a hand pushing down and i began to swim as though to move out from under its pressure,i wanted to get back to brenda for i worried once there was no evidence was there if i stayed away too long she would not be there when i returned,roth
2327,2328,i wished that i had carried her glasses away with me so she would have to wait for me to lead her back home,i was having crazy thoughts i knew and yet they did not seem uncalled for in the darkness and strangeness of that place,roth
2329,2330,oh how i wanted to call out to her from the pool but i knew she would not answer and i forced myself to swim the length a third time and then a fourth but midway through the fifth i felt a weird fright again had momentary thoughts of my own extinction and that time when i came back i held her tighter than either of us expected,i settled back and waited for the sun to dawn over the ninth hole prayed it would if only for the comfort of its light and when brenda finally returned to me i would not let her go and her cold wetness crept into me somehow and made me shiver,roth
2331,2332,that s it brenda,i saw brenda every evening we went swimming we went for walks we went for rides up through the mountains so far and so long that by the time we started back the fog had begun to emerge from the trees and push out into the road and i would tighten my hands on the wheel and brenda would put on her glasses and watch the white line for me,roth
2333,2334,and we would few nights after my discovery of the fruit refrigerator brenda led me to it herself,we would fill huge soup bowls with cherries and in serving dishes for roast beef we would head slices of watermelon then we would eo up and out the back doorway of the basement and onto the back lawn and sit under the sportinggoods tree the light from the tv room the only brightness we had out there,roth
2335,2336,all we would hear for while were just the two of us spitting pits,i m not being nasty i d add quickly and brenda would laugh and say she felt like a greengage plum and i would disappear down into the basement and the cherry bowl would now be a greengage plum bowl and then a nectarine bowl and then a peach bowl until i have to admit it i cracked my frail bowel and would have to spend the following night sadly on the wagon,roth
2337,2338,and then too we went out for corned beef sandwiches pizza beer and shrimp ice cream sodas and hamburgers,we went to the lions club fair one night and brenda won a lions club ashtray by shooting three baskets in a row,roth
2339,2340,and when ron came home from milwaukee we went from time to time to see him play basketball in the semipro summer league and it was those evenings that i felt a stranger with brenda for she knew all the players names and though for the most part they were gawkylimbed and dull there was one named luther ferrari who was neither and whom brenda had dated for a whole year in high school,he was ron s closest friend and i remembered his name from the newark news he was one of the great ferrari brothers all state all of them in at least two sports,roth
2341,2342,it was ferrari who called brenda buck a nickname which apparently went back to her ribbonwinning days like ron ferrari was exceedinriy polite as though it were some affliction of those over six feet three he was gentlemanly towards me and gentle towards brenda and after a while i balked when the suggestion was made that we go to see ron play,and then one nightwe discovered that at eleven o clock the cashier of the hilltop theatre went home and the manager disappeared into his office and so that summer we saw the last quarter of at least fifteen movies and then when we were driving brenda home that would try to reconstruct the beginnings of the films,roth
2343,2344,our favorite last quarter of a movie was ma and pa kettle in the city our favorite fruit greengage plums and our favorite our only people each other,of course we ran into others from time to time some of brenda s friends and occasionally one or two of mine,roth
2345,2346,one night in august we even went to a bar out on route with laura simpson stolowitch and her fiancé but it was a dreary evening,brenda and i seemed untrained in talking to others and so we danced a great deal which we realized was one thing we d never done before,roth
2347,2348,laura s boyfriend drank stingers pompously and wanted me to call her stolo but i didn drank a tepid combination of something like ginger ale and soda,whenever we returned to the table simp would be talking about the dance and her fiancé about the film until finally brenda asked him which film and then we danced till closing time,roth
2349,2350,and when we went back to brenda s we filled a bowl with cherries which we carried into the tv room and ate sloppily for a while and later on the sofa we loved each other and when i moved from the darkened room to the bathroom i could always feel cherry pits against my bare soles,at home undressing for the second time that night i would find red marks on the undersides of my feet,roth
2351,2352,and how did her parents take all of this,mrs,roth
2353,2354,patimkin continued to smile at me and mr,patimkin continued to think i ate like a bird,roth
2355,2356,when invited to dinner i would for his benefit eat twice what i wanted but the truth seemed to be that after he d characterized my appetite that first time he never really bothered to look again,i might have eaten ten times my normal amount have finally killed myself with food he would still have considered me not a man but a sparrow,roth
2357,2358,no one seemed distressed by my presence though julie had cooled considerably consequently when brenda suggested to her father that at the end of august i spend a week of my vacation at the patimkin house he pondered a moment decided on the five iron made his approach shot and said yes,and when she passed on to her mother the decision of patimkin sink there wasn t much mrs,roth
2359,2360,patimkin could do,so through brenda s craftiness i was invited,roth
2361,2362,on that friday morning that was to be my last day of work my aunt gladys saw me packing my bag and she asked where i was going,i told her,roth
2363,2364,a week she said,thank god we always had a roof,roth
2365,2366,we never went begging in the streets she told me as i packed the bermudas i d just bought and your cousin susan we ll put through college uncle max should live and be well,you leave over sometimes i show your uncle max your plate it s a shame,roth
2367,2368,i get everything i want here,i m just taking a vacation,roth
2369,2370,i told your mother i would take care of her neil she shouldn t worry,c mon i said you re being silly,roth
2371,2372,i m not running away,i ll see it i ll believe it she wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron just as i was zipping up the sides of the suitcase,roth
2373,2374,don t close the bag yet,a few hours later mr,roth
2375,2376,scapello informed me that when i returned from my vacation after labor day i would be hoisted up onto martha winney s stool,he himself he said had made the same move some twelve years ago and so it appeared that if i could manage to maintain my balance i might someday be mr,roth
2377,2378,scapello,i would also get an eightdollar increase in salary which was five dollars more than the increase mr,roth
2379,2380,scapello had received years before,he shook my hand and then started back up the long flight of marble stairs his behind barging against his suit jacket like a hoop,roth
2381,2382,no sooner had he left my side then i smelled spearmint and looked up to see the old man with veiny nose and jowls,hello young man he said pleasantly,roth
2383,2384,i was shopping and i thought i d stop by to ask,i haven t gotten the card yet,roth
2385,2386,scapello had stopped midway up the stairs and turned as though he d forgotten to tell me something,look i said to the old man it should be back any day i said it with a finality that bordered on rudeness and i alarmed myself for suddenly i saw what would happen the old man making a fuss mr,roth
2387,2388,scapello gliding down the stairs mr,scapello scampering up to the stacks scapello scandalized scapello profuse scapello presiding at the ascension of john mckee to miss winney s stool,roth
2389,2390,i turned to the old man why don t you leave your phone number and i ll try to get a hold of it this but my attempt at concern and courtesy came too late and the man growled some words about public servants a letter to the mayor snotty kids and left the library thank god only a second before mr,scapello returned to my desk to remind me that everyone was chipping in for a present for miss winney and that if i liked i should leave a half dollar on his desk during the day,roth
2391,2392,after lunch the colored kid came in,when he headed past the desk for the stairs i called over to him,roth
2393,2394,come here i said,goagain s book,roth
2395,2396,look man i ain t doing nothing wrong,i didn t do no writing in anything,roth
2397,2398,listen if you like that book so much why don t you please take it home,then you won t have to come down here every day,roth
2399,2400,miller street school,but this here s summertime,roth
2401,2402,it s okay i m not in school,as long as you go to school you can have a library card,roth
2403,2404,don t you worry he said to me,ain t nobody done that yet and he tapped off to the stairs and stack three,roth
2405,2406,did i perspire that day,it was the coolest of the summer but when i left work in the evening my shirt was sticking to my back,roth
2407,2408,in the car i opened my bag and while the rushhour traffic flowed down washington street i huddled in the back and changed into a clean shirt so that when i reached short hills i d look as though i was deserving of an interlude in the suburbs,but driving up central avenue i could not keep my mind on my vacation or for that matter on my driving to the distress of pedestrians and motorists i ground gears overshot crosswalks hesitated at green and red lights alike,roth
2409,2410,i kept thinking that while i was on vacation that jowly bastard would return to the library that the colored kid s book would disappear that my new job would be taken away from me that in fact my old then why should i worry about all that the library wasn t going to be my life,labor day,roth
2411,2412,he s marrying harriet he s marrying harriet she began to sing it like a jumprope song nasal and rhythmic,they spoke long distance for forty minutes last night,roth
2413,2414,she s flying here next week and there s going to be a huge wedding,my parents are flittering all over the place,roth
2415,2416,they ve got to arrange everything in about a day or two,and my father s taking ron in the he s going to have to start at two hundred a week and then work himself up,roth
2417,2418,don t be funny young lady mrs,patimkin said,roth
2419,2420,i m going to be an aunt julie sang and she stuck her tongue out at brenda,when is harriet coming mr,roth
2421,2422,patimkin breathed through a mouthful of potatoes,after dinner my bag was to the guest room which was across from ron s room and right down the hall from brenda,roth
2423,2424,brenda came along to show me the way,can we,roth
2425,2426,my mother ll have a fit,i unpacked my bag and dropped my clothes into a drawer that was empty except for a packet of dress shields and a high school yearbook,roth
2427,2428,in the middle of my unpacking ron came clunking up the stairs,hi he called into my room,roth
2429,2430,congratulations i called back,i should have realized that any word of ceremony would provoke a handshake from ron he interrupted whatever it was he was about to do in his room and came into mine,roth
2431,2432,thanks he pumped me,i have one shirt with a brooks brothers label and i let it linger on the bed a while the arrows i heaped in the drawer,roth
2433,2434,ron sat there rubbing his forearm and grinning,after a while i was thoroughly unsettled by the silence,roth
2435,2436,how does it feel i asked after another longer silence,better,roth
2437,2438,good i said,ron finally risked a journey into language,roth
2439,2440,do you know anything about music he asked,i didn t know you were interested in music,roth
2441,2442,sure,i got all the andre kostelanetz records ever made,roth
2443,2444,you like mantovani,i got all of him too,roth
2445,2446,i like semiclassical a lot,you can hear my columbus record if you want he dwindled off,roth
2447,2448,finally he shook my hand and left,downstairs i could hear julie singing,roth
2449,2450,i m going to be an aaaunt and mrs,patimkin saying to her no honey you re going to be a sisterinlaw,roth
2451,2452,sing that sweetheart but julie continued to sing i m going to be an aaaunt and then i heard brenda s voice joining hers singing we re going to be an aaaunt and then julie joined that and finally mrs,patimkin called to mr,roth
2453,2454,patimkin will you make her stop encouraging her and soon the duet ended,and then i heard mrs,roth
2455,2456,patimkin again,i couldn t make out the words but brenda answered her,roth
2457,2458,their voices grew louder finally i could hear perfectly,i need a houseful of company at a time like this it was mrs,roth
2459,2460,patimkin,i asked you mother you asked your father,roth
2461,2462,i m the one you should have asked first,he doesn t know how much extra work this is for my god mother you d think we didn t have carlota and jenny carlota and jenny can t do everything,roth
2463,2464,this is not the salvation army what the hell does that mean watch your tongue young lady,that may be very well for your college friends oh stop it mother don t raise your voice to me,roth
2465,2466,when s the last time you lifted a finger to help around here i m not a slave i m a daughter you ought to learn what a day s work means why brenda said,why because you re lazy mrs,roth
2467,2468,patimkin answered and you think the world owes you a living whoever said that you ought to earn some money and buy your own clothes why,good god mother daddy could live off the stocks alone for god s sake,roth
2469,2470,what are you complaining about when s the last time you washed the dishes jesus christ brenda flared carlota washes the dishes don t jesus christ me oh mother and brenda was crying,the words belonged to night and day but i didn t recognize ron s tune,roth
2471,2472,in a minute he picked up the phone and asked the operator for a milwaukee number,while she connected him he rolled over and turned up the volume on the record player so that it would carry the nine hundred miles west,roth
2473,2474,i heard julie downstairs,your day ll come you little bastard she called,roth
2475,2476,brenda mrs,patimkin called,roth
2477,2478,mommy julie cried,patimkin shouted,roth
2479,2480,you call me mrs,p carlota shouted,roth
2481,2482,goddam her brenda said to me as she paced up and down my room,is ron in his room,roth
2483,2484,they all creep around in sneakers,that he s getting married just has her flipped,roth
2485,2486,and me,it was dark and cool the trees rustled and flapped as though they were sheets that had been hung out to dry,roth
2487,2488,everything outside hinted at september and for the first time i realized how close we were to brenda s departure for school,is it bren but she was not listening to me,roth
2489,2490,she walked across the room to a door at the far end of the room,she opened it,roth
2491,2492,i thought that was a closet i said,what s in here i said,roth
2493,2494,when the puny sixtywatt bulb was twisted on i saw that the place was full of old wing chairs with hairoil lines at the back a sofa with a paunch in its middle a bridge table two bridge chairs with their stuffing showing a mirror whose backing had peeled off shadeless lamps lampless shades a coffee table with a cracked glass top and a pile of rolled up shades,what is this i said,roth
2495,2496,a storeroom,come here she was on her hands and knees in front of the sofa and was holding up its paunch to peek beneath,roth
2497,2498,brenda what the hell are we doing here,it had begun to rain outside and we could smell the fall dampness coming through the vent that was outlined at the far end of the storeroom,roth
2499,2500,brenda got up from the floor and sat down on the sofa,her knees and bermudas were dirty and when she pushed her hair back she dirtied her forehead,roth
2501,2502,there among the disarrangement and dirt i had the strange experience of seeing us both of us placed among disarrangement and dirt we looked like a young couple who had just moved into a new apartment we had suddenly taken stock of our furniture finances and future and all we could feel any pleasure about was the clean smell of outside which reminded us we were alive but which in a pinch would not feed us,what money i said again,roth
2503,2504,the hundreddollar bills,from when i was a little girl and she breathed deeply,roth
2505,2506,when i was little and we d just moved from newark my father took me up here one day,he took me into this room and told me that if anything should ever happen to him he wanted me to know where there was some money that i should have,roth
2507,2508,he said it wasn t for anybody else but me and that i should never tell anyone about it not even ron,i d never seen them before,roth
2509,2510,i was nine around julie s age,i don t think we d been living here a month,roth
2511,2512,i remember i used to come up here about once a week when no one was home but carlota and crawl under the sofa and make sure it was still here,and it always was,roth
2513,2514,he never mentioned it once again,i guess i stopped looking at one time or another and then i forgot about it,roth
2515,2516,or just didn t think about it,i mean i always had enough i didn t need this,roth
2517,2518,why did you want it now i said,i don t know she said and went over and twisted the bulb off,roth
2519,2520,i didn t move from the chair and brenda in her tight shorts and shirt seemed naked standing there a few feet away,then i saw her shoulders shaking,roth
2521,2522,i wanted to find it and tear it up in little pieces and put the goddam pieces in her purse,here,roth
2523,2524,the next morning brenda made breakfast for the two of us,ron had gone off to his first day of d heard him singing in the shower only an hour after i d returned to my own room in fact i had still been awake when the chrysler had pulled out of the garage carrying boss and son down to the patimkin works in newark,roth
2525,2526,mrs,patimkin wasn t home either she had taken her car and had gone off to the temple to talk to rabbi kranitz about the wedding,roth
2527,2528,julie was on the back lawn playing at helping carlota hang the clothes,you know what i want to do this morning brenda said,roth
2529,2530,we were eating a grapefruit sharing it rather sloppily for brenda couldn t find a paring knife and so we d decided to peel it down like an orange and eat the segments separately,what i said,roth
2531,2532,run she said,god yes,roth
2533,2534,in high school we had to run a mile every month,so we wouldn t be momma s boys,roth
2535,2536,some kids were playing with a dog out in the grassy center of the track and at the far end near the woods a figure in white shorts with slits in the side and no shirt was twirling twirling and then flinging a shot put as far as he could,after it left his hand he did a little eagleeyed tap dance while he watched it arch and bend and land in the distance,roth
2537,2538,you know brenda said you look like me,she meant i was sure that i was somehow beginning to look the way she wanted me to,roth
2539,2540,like herself,let s see who s faster she said and then we started along the track,roth
2541,2542,within the first eighth of a mile the three little boys and their dog were following us,as we passed the corner where the shot putter was he waved at us brenda called hi and i smiled which as you may or may not know makes one engaged in serious running feel inordinately silly,roth
2543,2544,at the quarter mile the kids dropped off and retired to the grass the dog turned and started the other way and i had a tiny knife in my side,still i was abreast of brenda who as we started on the second lap called hi once again to the lucky shot nutter who was reclining on the grass now watching us and rubbing his shot like a crystal ball ah i thought there s the sport,roth
2545,2546,how about us throwing the shot put i panted,after she said and i saw beads of sweat clinging to the last strands of hair that shagged off her ear,roth
2547,2548,when we approached the half mile brenda suddenly swerved off the track onto the grass and tumbled down her departure surprised me and i was still running,you re good she said,roth
2549,2550,my hands were on my hips and i was looking at the ground and sucking air was sucking me i didn t have much to say about it,uhhuh i breathed,roth
2551,2552,let s do this every morning she said,we ll get up and have two grapefruit and then you ll come out here and ran,roth
2553,2554,i ll time you,in two weeks you ll break four minutes won t you sweetie,roth
2555,2556,i ll get ron s stop watch she was so d slid over on the grass and was pushing my socks up against my wet ankles and calves,she bit my kneecap,roth
2557,2558,okay i said,and the next morning my mouth still edgy from the grapefruit segments we were at the track,roth
2559,2560,we had ron s stop watch and a towel for me for when i was finished,my legs are a little sore i said,roth
2561,2562,do some exercises brenda said,i ll do them with you she heaped the towel on the grass and together we did deep knee bends and situps and pushups and some highknee raising in place,roth
2563,2564,i felt overwhelmingly happy,i m just going to run a half today bren,roth
2565,2566,we ll see what i do and i heard brenda click the watch and then when i was on the far side of the track the clouds trailing above me like my own white fleecy tail i saw that brenda was on the ground hugging her knees and alternately checking the watch and looking out at me,we were the only ones there and it all reminded me of one of those scenes in racehorse movies where an old trainer like walter brennan and a young handsome man clock the beautiful girl s horse in the early kentucky morning to see if it really is the fastest twoyearold alive,roth
2567,2568,there were differences all being simply that at the quarter mile brenda shouted out to me a minute and fourteen seconds but it was pleasant and exciting and clean and when i was finished brenda was standing up and waiting for me,instead of a tape to break i had brenda s sweet flesh to meet and i did and it was the first time she said that she loved me,roth
2569,2570,we morning and by the end of the week i was running a mile and always at the end there was the little click of the watch and brenda s arms,at night i would read in my pajamas while brenda in her room read and we would wait for ron to go to sleep,roth
2571,2572,some nights we had to wait longer than others and i would hear the leaves swishing outside for it had grown cooler at the end of august and the airconditioning was turned off at night and we were all allowed to open our windows,finally ron would be ready for bed,roth
2573,2574,he would stomp around his room and then he would come to the door in his shorts and tshirt and go into the bathroom where he would urinate loudly and brush his teeth,after he brushed his teeth i would go in to brash mine,roth
2575,2576,we would pass in the hall and i would give him a hearty and sincere goodnight once in the bathroom i would spend a moment admiring my tan in the mirror behind me i could see ron s jock straps hanging out to dry on the hot and cold knobs of the shower,nobody ever questioned their tastefulness as adornment and after a few nights i didn t even notice them,roth
2577,2578,while ron brushed his teeth and i waited in my bed for my turn i could hear the record player going in his room,generally after coming in from basketball he would call was now only a few days away from then would lock himself up with sports illustrated and mantovani however when he emerged from his room for his evening toilet it was not a mantovani record i would hear playing but something else apparently what he d once referred to as his columbus record,roth
2579,2580,i imagined that was what i heard for i could not tell much from the last moments of sound,all i heard were bells moaning evenly and soft patriotic music behind them and riding over it all a deep kind of edward r murrow gloomy voice and so goodbye columbus the voice intoned columbus then there would be silence and ron would be back in his room the light would switch off and in only a few minutes i would hear him rumbling down into that exhilarating restorative vitaminpacked sleep that i imagined athletes to enjoy,roth
2581,2582,one morning near sneakingaway time i had a dream and when i awakened from it there was just enough dawn coming into the room for me to see the color of brenda s hair,i touched her in her sleep for the dream had unsettled me it had taken place on a ship an old sailing ship like those you see in pirate movies,roth
2583,2584,with me on the ship was the little colored kid from the was the captain and he my mate and we were the only crew members,for a while it was a pleasant dream we were anchored in the harbor of an island in the pacific and it was very sunny,roth
2585,2586,up on the beach there were beautiful bareskinned negresses and none of them moved but suddenly we were moving our shin out of the harbor and the negresses moved slowly down to the shore and began to throw leis at us and say goodbye columbus goodbye columbus and though we did not want to go the little boy and i the boat was moving and there was nothing we could do about it and he shouted at me that it was my fault and i shouted it was his for not having a library card but we were wasting our breath for we were further and further from the island and soon the natives were nothing at all,space was all out of proportion in the dream and things were sized and squared in no way i d ever seen before and i think it was that more than anything else that steered me into consciousness,roth
2587,2588,i did not want to leave brenda s side that morning and for a while i played with the little point at the nape of her neck where she d had her hair cut,i stayed longer than i should have and when finally i returned to my room i almost ran into ron who was preparing for his day at patimkin kitchen and bathroom sinks,roth
2589,2590,so we would be with each other until the summer s last moment,this should have made me overjoyed but as brenda trotted back down the stairs to accompany her family to the they were to pick up was not joyful but disturbed as i had been more and more with the thought that when brenda went back to radcliffe that would be the end for me,roth
2591,2592,i was convinced that even miss winney s stool was not high enough for me to see clear up to boston,nevertheless i tossed my clothing back into the drawer and was able finally to tell myself that there d been no hints of ending our affair from brenda and any suspicions i had any uneasiness was spawned in my own uncertain heart,roth
2593,2594,then i went into ron s room to call my aunt,hello she said,roth
2595,2596,i m having a good time,mrs,roth
2597,2598,what should he be,uncle max is uncle max,roth
2599,2600,you ll find out,i ll drop them a note,roth
2601,2602,be a good girl i said,goodbye honey and i hung up,roth
2603,2604,down in the kitchen carlota was getting dinner ready,i was always amazed at how carlota s work never seemed to get in the way of her life,roth
2605,2606,she made household chores seem like illustrative gestures of whatever it was she was singing even if as now it was i get a kick out of you she moved from the oven to the automatic pushed buttons turned dials peeked in the glassdoored oven and from time to time picked a big black grape out of a bunch that lay on the sink,she chewed and chewed humming all the time and then with a deliberated casualness shot the skin and the pit directly into the garbage disposal unit,roth
2607,2608,i said hello to her as i went out the back door and though she did not return the greeting i felt a kinship with one who like me had been partially wooed and won on patimkin fruit,nothing diverted felt openstomached as though i hadn t eaten for months and though i went back inside and came out with my own handful of grapes the feeling continued and i knew it had nothing to do with my caloric intake it was only a rumor of the hollowness that would come when brenda was away,roth
2609,2610,the fact of her departure had of course been on my mind for a while but overnight it had taken on a darker hue,curiously the darkness seemed to have something to do with harriet ron s intended and i thought for a time that it was simply the reality of harriet s arrival that had dramatized the passing of time we had been talking about it and now suddenly it was as brenda s departure would be here before we knew it,roth
2611,2612,but it was more than that the union of harriet and ron reminded me that separation need not be a permanent state,people could marry each other even if they were young,roth
2613,2614,and yet brenda and i had never mentioned marriage except perhaps for that night at the pool when she d said when you love me everything will be all right well i loved her and she me and things didn t seem all right at all,or was i inventing troubles again,roth
2615,2616,i supposed i should really have thought my lot improved considerably yet there on the lawn the august sky seemed too beautiful and temporary to bear and i wanted brenda to marry me,marriage though was not what i proposed to her when she drove the car up the driveway alone some fifteen minutes later,roth
2617,2618,that proposal would have taken a kind of courage that i did not think i had,i did not feel myself prepared for any answer but halleluiah any other kind of yes wouldn t have satisfied me and any kind of no even one masked behind the words let s wait sweetheart would have been my end,roth
2619,2620,so i imagine that s why i proposed the surrogate which turned out finally to be far more daring than i knew it to be at the time,harriet s plane is late so i drove home brenda called,roth
2621,2622,i have to tell carlota and she went inside,in a few minutes she appeared on the porch,roth
2623,2624,she wore a yellow dress that cut a widebottomed u across her shoulders and neck and showed where the tanned flesh began above her breasts,on the lawn she stepped out of her heels and walked barefoot over to where i was sitting under the oak tree,roth
2625,2626,women who wear high heels all the time get tipped ovaries she said,what she said,roth
2627,2628,i know this is out of the blue though really it s not i want you to buy a diaphragm,don t worry sweetie we re careful,roth
2629,2630,it s not even safety i added,you just want me to own one is that it,roth
2631,2632,whose,she did not answer me but rubbed her fingers along the ridge of her collarbone to wipe away the tiny globes of perspiration that had suddenly formed there,roth
2633,2634,patimkin had laid the day before,come back here i said,roth
2635,2636,you re the one who s being selfish,my pleasure,roth
2637,2638,she walked over to me leaving white footprints on the grass,i didn t think you were such a creature of the flesh she said,roth
2639,2640,didn t you i said,i ll tell you something that you ought to know,roth
2641,2642,why you re even bothering,that s all,roth
2643,2644,no explanation,just do it,roth
2645,2646,i closed my eyes and leaned back and in fifteen minutes or maybe less i heard somebody stroking at the cotton golf ball,she had changed into shorts and a blouse and was still barefoot,roth
2647,2648,we didn t speak with each other but i watched her bring the club back of her ear and then swing through her chin tilted up with the line of flight a regular golf ball would have taken,that s five hundred yards i said,roth
2649,2650,she didn t answer but walked after the cotton ball and then readied for another swing,brenda,roth
2651,2652,bren i know it was probably a surprise,it was for me,roth
2653,2654,it s not because you asked me to either,i don t know where you get that from,roth
2655,2656,i just me,that s exactly it,roth
2657,2658,don t you see,i just know,roth
2659,2660,you re the one who s being dramatic,you think there would be something affairish about it then,roth
2661,2662,you re the one who s thinking about last summer about an end for us,i want this to end,roth
2663,2664,that s why i ask you to stay another week that s why i let you sleep with me in my own house,what s the matter with you,roth
2665,2666,harriet ehrlich impressed me as a young lady singularly unconscious of a motive in others or herself,all was surfaces and she seemed a perfect match for ron and too for the patimkins,roth
2667,2668,mrs,patimkin in fact did just as brenda prophesied harriet appeared and brenda s mother lifted one wing and pulled the girl in towards the warm underpart of her body where brenda herself would have liked to nestle,roth
2669,2670,harriet was built like brenda although a little chestier and she nodded her head insistently whenever anyone spoke,sometimes she would even say the last few words of your sentence with you though that was infrequent for the most part she nodded and kept her hands folded all evening as the patimkins planned where the newlyweds should live what furniture they should buy how soon they should have a through this i kept thinking that harriet was wearing white gloves but she wasn t,roth
2671,2672,brenda and i did not exchange a word or a glance we sat listening brenda somewhat more impatient than me,near the end harriet began calling mrs,roth
2673,2674,patimkin mother and once mother patimkin and that was when brenda went to sleep,i stayed behind mesmerized almost by the dissection analysis reconsideration and finally the embracing of the trivial,roth
2675,2676,at last mr,and mrs,roth
2677,2678,patimkin tumbled off to bed and julie who had fallen asleep on her chair was carried into her room by ron,that left us two nonpatimkins together,roth
2679,2680,what had i said,you must get first crack at the bestsellers she said,roth
2681,2682,sometimes i said,well she said flapping her hands on her knees i m sure we ll all have a good time together,roth
2683,2684,soon,i knocked gently on brenda s door,roth
2685,2686,are you still angry i asked at last,you can forget about my suggestion,roth
2687,2688,i just wish you d realize what it is you re getting angry about,when i got downstairs the following morning there was a great deal of activity,roth
2689,2690,in the living room i heard mrs,patimkin reading a list to harriet while julie ran in and out of rooms in search of a skate key,roth
2691,2692,carlota was vacuum ing the carpet every appliance in the kitchen was bubbling twisting and shaking,brenda greeted me with a perfectly pleasant smile and in the dining room where i walked to look out at the back lawn and the weather she kissed me on the shoulder,roth
2693,2694,hello she said,so we can t run,roth
2695,2696,i ll read or something,shopping,roth
2697,2698,she s going to buy a wedding dress,for after the wedding,roth
2699,2700,when i came back brenda was gone and there were only carlota mrs,patimkin and myself in the house,roth
2701,2702,i tried to stay out of whichever rooms they were in but finally mrs,patimkin and i wound up sitting opposite each other in the tv room,roth
2703,2704,she was checking off names on a long sheet of paper she held next to her on the table were two thin phone books which she consulted from time to time,no rest for the weary she said to me,roth
2705,2706,i smiled hugely embracing the proverb as though mrs,patimkin had just then coined it,roth
2707,2708,yes,of course i said,roth
2709,2710,would you like some help,patimkin said,roth
2711,2712,she s in arizona now,she s with my father,roth
2713,2714,they went there for their asthma,i m staying with my aunt in newark,roth
2715,2716,she s not in hadassah,my aunt sylvia is though,roth
2717,2718,do you know her aaron klugman and sylvia,they belong to your club,roth
2719,2720,they have a daughter my cousin i couldn t stop myself live in livingston,maybe it isn t hadassah my aunt sylvia belongs to i think it s some tb organization,roth
2721,2722,or cancer,muscular dystrophy maybe,roth
2723,2724,patimkin said,patimkin i thought had begun to warm to me she let the purple eyes stop peering and just look out at the world for a while without judging,roth
2725,2726,are you interested in b nai brith she asked me,petulantly mrs,roth
2727,2728,patimkin went back to her lists and i realized it had been foolish of me to risk lightheartedness with her about jewish affairs,you re active in the temple aren t you i asked with all the interest i could muster,roth
2729,2730,yes she said,what temple do you belong to she asked in a moment,roth
2731,2732,we used to belong to hudson street synagogue,patimkin caught a false tone in my voice,roth
2733,2734,personally i thought i had managed my rueful confession pretty well especially when i recalled the decade of paganism prior to my parents departure,regardless mrs,roth
2735,2736,patimkin asked strategically it we re all going to temple friday night,why don t you come with us,roth
2737,2738,well i haven t gone in a long time i sort of i smiled,i m just jewish i said wellmeaningly but that too sent mrs,roth
2739,2740,patimkin back to her hadassah work,desperately i tried to think of something that would convince her i wasn t an infidel,roth
2741,2742,is he orthodox or conservative she asked,buber had only one set of dishes in her kitchen,roth
2743,2744,orthodox i said faintly,that s very nice she said,roth
2745,2746,i do,what are you i popped ushing,roth
2747,2748,orthodox,my husband is conservative which meant i took it that he didn t care,roth
2749,2750,patimkin looked at me and i wondered whether courtesy demanded that i agree,oh i don t know i said at last i d say brenda is conservative,roth
2751,2752,hello mrs,patimkin said,roth
2753,2754,patimkin glanced up at me then she put one hand over the mouthpiece,yes,roth
2755,2756,mr,patimkin has some silver patterns i have to see,roth
2757,2758,patimkin kitchen and bathroom sinks was in the heart of the negro section of newark,years ago at the time of the great immigration it had been the jewish section and still one could see the little fish stores the kosher delicatessens the turkish baths where my grandparents had shopped and bathed at the beginning of the century,roth
2759,2760,even the smells had lingered whitefish corned beef sour now on top of these was the grander greasier smell of auto wrecking shops the sour stink of a brewery the burning odor from a leather factory and on the streets instead of yiddish one heard the shouts of negro children playing at willie mays with a broom handle and half a rubber ball,the neighborhood had changed the old jews like my grandparents had struggled and died and their offspring had struggled and prospered and moved further and further west towards the edge of newark then out of it and up the slope of the orange mountains until they had reached the crest and started down the other side pouring into gentile territory as the scotchirish had poured through the cumberland gap now in fact the negroes were making the same migration following the steps of the jews and those who remained in the third ward lived thp most squalid of lives and dreamed in their fetid mattress of the piny smell of georgia nights,roth
2761,2762,i wondered for an instant only if i would see the colored kid from the library on the streets here,i didn t of course though i was sure he lived in one of the scabby peeling buildings out of which dogs children and aproned women moved continually,roth
2763,2764,on the top floors windows were open and the very old who could no longer creak down the long stairs to the street sat where they had been put in the screenless windows their elbows resting on fluffless pillows and their heads tipping forward on their necks watching the push of the young and the pregnant and the unemployed,who would come after the negroes,roth
2765,2766,who was left,no one i thought and someday these streets where my grandmother drank hot tea from an old jahrzeit glass would be empty and we would all of us have moved to the crest of the orange mountains and wouldn t the dead stop kicking at the slats in their coffins then,roth
2767,2768,two trucks were being loaded in the rear and mr,patimkin when i saw him had a cigar in his mouth and was shouting at someone,roth
2769,2770,it was ron who was wearing a white tshirt that said ohio state athletic association across the front,though he was taller than mr,roth
2771,2772,patimkin and almost as stout his hands hung weakly at his sides like a small boy s mr,patimkin s cigar locomoted in his mouth,roth
2773,2774,six negroes were loading one of the trucks feverishly stomach bowls at one another,ron left mr,roth
2775,2776,patimkin s side and went back to directing the men,he thrashed his arms about a good deal and though on the whole he seemed rather confused he didn t appear to be at all concerned about anybody dropping a sink,roth
2777,2778,suddenly i could see myself directing the would have an ulcer in an hour,i could almost hear the enamel surfaces shattering on the floor,roth
2779,2780,and i could hear myself watch it you guys,be careful will you,roth
2781,2782,whoops,oh please itl watch,roth
2783,2784,oh suppose mr,patimkin should come up to me and say okay boy you want to marry my daughter let s see what you can do well he would see in a moment that floor would be a shattered mosaic a crunchy path of enamel,roth
2785,2786,klugman what kind of worker are you,patimkin was headed back to the fish bowl to answer a ringing phone and i wrenched myself free of my reverie and headed towards the office too,roth
2787,2788,when i entered mr,patimkin looked up from the phone with his eyes the sticky cigar was in his free moved it at me a greeting,roth
2789,2790,from outside i heard ron call in a high voice you can t all go to lunch at the same time,patimkin shot at me though when he went back to his conversation i saw there was only one chair in the office his,roth
2791,2792,people did not sit at patimkin you earned your money the hard way standing up,i busied myself looking at the several calendars that hung from filing cabinets they showed illustrations of women so dreamy so fantastically thighed and uddered that one could not think of them as pornographic,roth
2793,2794,thé artist who had drawn the calendar girls for lewis construction company and earl s track and auto repair and grossman and son paper box had been painting some third sex i had never seen,sure sure sure mr,roth
2795,2796,patimkin said into the phone tomorrow don t tell me tomorrow,who was it,roth
2797,2798,lewis from the construction company,earl from track repair,roth
2799,2800,shit on that mr,patimkin said,roth
2801,2802,you re not the only one in town my good friend and he winked at me,ahha a conspiracy against grossman,roth
2803,2804,me and mr,patimkin,roth
2805,2806,i smiled as collusively as i knew how,it was only a big x,roth
2807,2808,my kid ll be here he said,patimkin laugh,roth
2809,2810,mr,patimkin hung up without a goodbye,roth
2811,2812,he looked out the back to see how ron was doing,what am i a genius,roth
2813,2814,i learned,mr,roth
2815,2816,patimkin looked at his cigar,a man works hard he s got something,roth
2817,2818,you don t get anywhere sitting on your behind you know the biggest men in the country worked hard believe me,even rockefeller,roth
2819,2820,success don t come he did not say this so much as he mused it out while he surveyed his dominion,he was not a man enamored of words and i had the feeling that what had tempted him into this barrage of universals was probably the combination of ron s performance and my the outsider who might one day be an insider,roth
2821,2822,but did mr,patimkin even consider that possibility,roth
2823,2824,i did not know i only knew that these few words he did speak could hardly transmit all the satisfaction and surprise he felt about the life he had managed to build for himself and his family,he looked out at ron again,roth
2825,2826,look at him if he played basketball like that they d throw him the hell off the court but he was smiling when he said it,he walked over to the door,roth
2827,2828,patimkin shouted,smart boy,roth
2829,2830,huh he tapped his head,that took brains huh,roth
2831,2832,he ain t got the stomach for business,he s an idealist and then i think mr,roth
2833,2834,patimkin suddenly realized who i was and eagerly corrected himself so as not to offend,that s all right you know if you re a schoolteacher or like you you know a student or something like that,roth
2835,2836,here you need a little of the gonif in you,you know what that means,roth
2837,2838,you know more than my own kids,they re goyim my kids that s how much they understand he watched the negro loading gang walk past the office and shouted out to them you guys know how long an hour is,roth
2839,2840,do you have that stuff for mrs,patimkin i asked,roth
2841,2842,ronald get him the silver patterns ron turned away and mr,patimkin said when i got married we had forks and knives from the five and ten,roth
2843,2844,this kid needs gold to eat off but there was no anger far from it,i drove to the mountains in my own car that afternoon and stood for a while at the wire fence watching the deer lightly prance coyly feed under the protection of signs that read do not feed the deer by order of south mountain reservation,roth
2845,2846,alongside me at the fence were dozens of kids they giggled and screamed when the deer licked the popcorn from their hands and then were sad when their own excitement sent the young loping away towards the far end of the field where their tawnyskinned mothers stood regally watching the traffic curl up the mountain road,young whiteskinned mothers hardly older than i and in many instances younger chatted in their convertibles behind me and looked down from time to time to see what their children were about,roth
2847,2848,i had seen them before when brenda and i had gone out for a bite in the afternoon or had driven up here for lunch in clotches of three and four they sat in the rustic hamburger joints that dotted the reservation area while their children gobbled hamburgers and malteds and were given dimes to feed the jukebox,though none of the little ones were old enough to read the song titles almost all of them could holler out the words and they did while the mothers a few of whom i recognized as high school mates of mine compared suntans supermarkets and vacations,roth
2849,2850,they looked immortal sitting there,their hair would always stay the color they desired their clothes the right texture and shade in their homes they would have simple swedish modem when that was fashionable and if huge ugly baroque ever came back out would go the long midgetlegged marble coffee table and in would come louis quatorze,roth
2851,2852,these were the goddesses and if i were paris i could not have been able to choose among them so microscopic were the differences,their fates had collapsed them into one,roth
2853,2854,only brenda shone,money and comfort would not erase her hadn t yet or had they,roth
2855,2856,what was i loving i wondered and since i am not one to stick scalpels into myself i wiggled my hand in the fence and allowed a tinynosed bui to lick my thoughts away,when i returned to the patimkin house brenda was in the living room looking more beautiful than i had ever seen her,roth
2857,2858,she was modeling her new dress for harriet and her mother,even mrs,roth
2859,2860,patimkin seemed softened by the sight of her it looked as though some sedative had been injected into her and so relaxed the brendahating muscles around her eyes and mouth,brenda without glasses modeled in place when she looked at me it was a kind of groggy halfwaking look i got and though others might have interpreted it as sleepiness it sounded in my veins as lust,roth
2861,2862,mrs,patimkin told her finally that she d bought a very nice dress and i told her she looked lovely and harriet told her she was very beautiful and that she ought to be the bride and then there was an uncomfortable silence while all of us wondered who ought to be the groom,roth
2863,2864,then when mrs,what is it honey i said,roth
2865,2866,neil i called margaret sanger clinic she said,neil they did ask if i was married,roth
2867,2868,i hung up she walked away and around the oak tree,when she appeared again she d stepped out of her shoes and held one hand on the tree as though it were a maypole she were circling,roth
2869,2870,you can call them back i said,she shook her head,roth
2871,2872,no i can t,i don t even know why i called in the first place,roth
2873,2874,look bren i said rushing to her we ll go together to a doctor,we ll go to the most posh gynecologist in new york,roth
2875,2876,one who gets harper s bazaar for the reception room,you ll come with me she asked,roth
2877,2878,i m on vacation i said but i had answered the wrong question,bren i ll wait and when you re all done we ll buy a drink,roth
2879,2880,it s the most right thing we can do she walked away and i was exhausted from pleading,somehow i felt i could have convinced her had i been a bit more crafty and yet i did not want it to be craftiness that changed her mind,roth
2881,2882,it was four days after the day she d called margaret put it off and put it off but finally on friday three days before ron s wedding and four before her departure we were heading through the lincoln tunnel which seemed longer and fumier than ever like hell with tiled walls,finally we were in new york and smothered again by the thick day,roth
2883,2884,i pulled around the policeman who directed traffic in his shirt sleeves and up onto the port authority roof to park the car,do you have cab fare i said,roth
2885,2886,there was a sudden shower while our cab went crosstown and when the rain stopped the streets were sticky and shiny and below the pavement was the rumble of the subways and in all it was like entering the ear of a lion,the doctor s office was in the squibb building which is across from bergdorf goodman s and so was a perfect place for brenda to add to her wardrobe,roth
2887,2888,for some reason we had never once considered her going to a doctor in newark perhaps because it was too close to home and might allow for possibilities of discovery,when brenda got to the revolving door she looked back at me her eyes were very watery even with her glasses and i did not say a word afraid what a word any word might do,roth
2889,2890,i kissed her hair and motioned that i would be across the street by the plaza fountain and then i watched her revolve through the doors,out on the street the traffic moved slowly as though the humidity were a wall holding everything back,roth
2891,2892,even the fountain seemed to be bubbling boiling water on the people who sat at its edge and in an instant i decided against crossing the street and turned south on fifth and began to walk the steaming pavement towards st,patrick s,roth
2893,2894,on the north steps a crowd was gathered everyone was watching a model being photographed,i took a seat at the rear and while i couldn t bring myself to kneel i did lean forward onto the back of the bench before me and held my hands together and closed my eyes,roth
2895,2896,i wondered if i looked like a catholic and in my wonderment i began to make a little speech to myself,can i call the selfconscious words i spoke prayer,roth
2897,2898,at any rate i called my audience god,god i said i am twentythree years old i want to make the best of things,roth
2899,2900,now the doctor is about to wed brenda to me and i am not entirely certain this is all for the best,what is it i love lord,roth
2901,2902,why have i chosen,who is brenda,roth
2903,2904,the race is to the swift,should i have stopped to think,roth
2905,2906,i was getting no answers but i went on,if we meet you at all god it s that we re carnal and acquisitive and thereby partake of you,roth
2907,2908,i am carnal and i know you approve i just know it,but how carnal can i get,roth
2909,2910,i am acquisitive,where do i turn now in my acquisitiveness,roth
2911,2912,where do we meet,which prize is you,roth
2913,2914,it was an ingenious meditation and suddenly i felt ashamed,and god only laughed that clown,roth
2915,2916,on the steps around the fountain i sat in a small arc of a rainbow that the sun had shot through the spray of the water,and then i saw brenda coming out of the squibb building,roth
2917,2918,she carried nothing with her like a woman who s only been window shopping and for a moment i was glad that in the end she had disobeyed my desire,as she crossed the street though that little levity passed and then i was myself again,roth
2919,2920,my answer at first was merely that victorious look of hers the one she d given simp the night she d beaten her the one i d gotten the morning i finished the third lap alone,and then the next day we hardly saw one another at all for with the lastminute wedding preparations came scurrying telegramming shouting crying short lunacy,roth
2921,2922,even the meals lost their patimkin fullness and were tortured out of kraft cheese stale onion rolls dry salami a little chopped liver and fruit cocktail,it was hectic all weekend and i tried as best i could to keep clear of the storm at whose eye ron clumsy and smiling and harriet flittering and courteous were being pulled closer and closer together,roth
2923,2924,by sunday night fatigue had arrested hysteria and all of the patimkins brenda included had gone off to an early sleep,when ron went into the bathroom to brush his teeth i decided to go in and brush mine,roth
2925,2926,while i stood over the sink he checked his supports for dampness then he hung them on the shower knobs and asked me if i would like to listen to his records for a while,it was not out of boredom and loneliness that i accepted rather a brief spark of lockerroom comradery had been struck there among the soap and the water and the tile and i thought that perhaps ron s invitation was prompted by a desire to spend his last moments as a single man with another single man,roth
2927,2928,if i was right then it was the first real attestation he d given to my masculinity,how could i refuse,roth
2929,2930,i sat on the unused twin bed,hey how about the columbus record,roth
2931,2932,then he smiled at me and leaned back onto his bed,his arms were behind his head and his eyes fixed on the ceiling,roth
2933,2934,they give this to all the seniors,with the but he hushed as soon as the sound began,roth
2935,2936,i watched ron and listened to the record,at first there was just a roll of drums then silence then another drum then softly a marching song the melody of which was very familiar,roth
2937,2938,when the song ended i heard the bells soft loud then soft again,and finally there came a voice boweldeep and historic the kind one associates with documentaries about the rise of fascism,roth
2939,2940,the year,the season fall,roth
2941,2942,judgment day,the lord had lowered his baton and the ohio state glee club were lining out the alma mater as if their souls depended on it,roth
2943,2944,smoky fires line fraternity row as pledges rake the leaves and turn them to a misty haze,glee club in great comeback,roth
2945,2946,then the voice the place the banks of the olentangy,the event homecoming game,roth
2947,2948,new stern illini over the ball,the snap,roth
2949,2950,linday fading to pass he finds a receiver he passes long long down it s intercepted by number herb clark of ohio state,clark evades one tackier he evades another as he comes up to midfield,roth
2951,2952,and it s the buckeyes ahead now to,the minnesota game a new high voice announced and for some of our seniors their last game for the red and white the players are ready to come out on the floor and into the spotlight,roth
2953,2954,there ll be a big hand of appreciation from this capacity crowd for some of the boys who won t be back next year,here comes larry gardner bia number out onto the floor bis larry from akron,roth
2955,2956,system larry the crowd roared back,and here comes ron patimkin dribbling out,roth
2957,2958,ron number from short hills new jersey,for several thousand young men and women it is a joyous yet a solemn occasion,roth
2959,2960,and for their parents a day of laughter and a day of tears,it is a bright green day it is june the seventh of the year one thousand nine hundred and fiftyseven and for these young americans the most stirring day of their lives,roth
2961,2962,for many this will be their last glimpse of the campus of columbus for many many years,life calls us and anxiously if not nervously we walk out into the world and away from the pleasures of these ivied walls,roth
2963,2964,but not from its memories,they will be the concomitant if not the fundament of our lives,roth
2965,2966,we shall choose husbands and wives we shall choose jobs and homes we shall sire children and grandchildren but we will not forget you ohio state,soft very soft for it is spring,roth
2967,2968,there was goose flesh on ron s veiny arms as the voice continued,we offer ourselves to you then world and come at you in search of life,roth
2969,2970,and to you ohio state to you columbus we say thank you thank you and goodbye,we will miss you in the fall in the winter in the spring but some day we shall return,roth
2971,2972,the band was upending its last truckload of nostalgia and i tiptoed from the room in step with the members of the class of,i closed my door but then opened it and looked back at ron he was still humming on his bed,roth
2973,2974,thee,i thought my brotherinlaw,roth
2975,2976,the wedding,let me begin with the relatives,roth
2977,2978,there was mrs,patimkin s side of the family her sister molly a tiny buxom hen whose ankles swelled and ringed her shoes and who would remember ron s wedding if for no other reason than she d martyred her feet in threeinch heels and molly s husband the butter and egg man harry grossbart who had earned his fortune with barley and com in the days of prohibition,roth
2979,2980,now he was active in the temple and whenever he saw brenda he swatted her on the can it was a kind of physical bootlegging that passed i guess for familial affection,then there was mrs,roth
2981,2982,patimkin s brother marty kreiger the kosher hotdog king an immense man as many stomachs as he had chins and already at fiftyfive with as many heart attacks as chins and stomachs combined,he had just come back from a health cure in the catskills where he said he d eaten nothing but allbran and had won at gin rummy,roth
2983,2984,when the photographer came by to take pictures marty put his hand on his wife s pancake breasts and said hey how about a picture of this his wife sylvia was a frail spindly woman with bones like a bird s,she had cried throughout the ceremony and sobbed openly in fact when the rabbi had pronounced ron and harriet man and wife in the eyes of god and the state of new jersey later at dinner she had hardened enough to slap her husband s hand as it reached out for a cigar,roth
2985,2986,however when he reached across to hold her breast she just looked aghast and said nothing,also there were mrs,roth
2987,2988,patimkin s twin sisters rose and pearl who both had white hair the color of lincoln convertibles and nasal voices and husbands who followed after them but talked only to each other as though in fact sister had married sister and husband had married husband,the husbands named earl klein and manny kartzman sat next to each other during the ceremony then at dinner and once in fact while the band was playing between courses they rose klein and kartzman as though to dance but instead walked to the far end of the hall where together they paced off the width of the floor,roth
2989,2990,earl i learned later was in the carpet business and apparently he was trying to figure how much money he would make if the hotel pierre favored him with a sale,on mr,roth
2991,2992,patimkin s side there was only leo his halfbrother,leo was married to a woman named bea whom nobody seemed to talk to,roth
2993,2994,bea kept hopping up and down during the meal and running over to the kiddie table to see if her little girl sharon was being taken care of,i told her not to take the kid,roth
2995,2996,get a babysitter i said leo told me this while brenda danced with ron s best man ferrari,she says what are we millionaires,roth
2997,2998,no for christ sake but my brother s kids gets married i can have a little celebration,no we got ta shlep the kid with us,roth
2999,3000,aah it gives her something to do he looked around the hall,up on the stage harry winters né weinberg was leading his band in a medley from my fair lady on the floor all ages all sizes all shapes were dancing,roth
3001,3002,mr,patimkin was dancing with julie whose dress had slipped down from her shoulders to reveal her soft small back and long neck like brenda s,roth
3003,3004,he danced in little squares and was making considerable effort not to step on julie s toes,harriet who was as everyone said a beautiful bride was dancing with her father,roth
3005,3006,ron danced with harriet s mother brenda with ferrari and i had sat down for a while in the empty chair beside leo so as not to get maneuvered into dancing with mrs,patimkin which seemed to be the direction towards which things were moving,roth
3007,3008,you re brenda s boy friend,huh leo said,roth
3009,3010,i in the evening i d stopped giving blushing explanations,leo poured himself a glass of champagne and then waited as though he expected a head to form on it when one didn t he filled the glass to the brim,roth
3011,3012,beautiful not beautiful what s the difference,i m a practical man,roth
3013,3014,i m on the bottom so i got ta be,you re aly khan you worry about marrying movie stars,roth
3015,3016,i wasn t born yesterday you know how old i was when i got married,thirtyfive years old,roth
3017,3018,i don t know what the hell kind of hurry i was in he drained his glass and refilled it,i ll tell you something one good thing happened to me in my whole life,roth
3019,3020,two maybe,before i came back from overseas i got a letter from my wasn t my wife then,roth
3021,3022,my motherinlaw found an apartment for us in queens,i don t remember,roth
3023,3024,i say two because my wife tells me i m sarcastic and a cynic,patimkin separated from julie and it looked as though the two men were going to switch partners,roth
3025,3026,instead the four of them stood on the dance floor and when i reached them they were laughing and julie was saying what s so funny ferrari said hi to me and whisked julie away which sent her into peals of laughter,mr,roth
3027,3028,patimkin had one hand on brenda s back and suddenly the other one was on mine,you kids having a good time he said,roth
3029,3030,yes she said,you like weddings daddy brenda said,roth
3031,3032,i like my kids he slapped me on the back,you two kids you want anything,roth
3033,3034,go have a good time,remember he said to brenda you re my then he looked at me,roth
3035,3036,whatever my buck wants is good enough for me,patimkin departed brenda and i danced closely and we only sat down when the waiters began to circulate with the main course,roth
3037,3038,the head table was noisy particularly at our end where the men were almost all teammates of ron s in one sport or another they ate a fantastic number of rolls,tank feldman ron s roommate who had flown in from toledo kept sending the waiter back for rolls for celery for olives and always to the squealing delight of gloria feldman his wife a nervous undernourished girl who continually looked down the front of her gown as though there was some sort of construction project going on under her clothes,roth
3039,3040,gloria and tank in fact seemed to be selfappointed precinct captains at our end,they proposed toasts burst into wild song and continually referred to brenda and me as love birds brenda smiled at this with her eyeteeth and i brought up a cheery look from some fraudulent auricle of my heart,roth
3041,3042,and the night continued we ate we drank we and pearl did the charleston with one another while their husbands examined woodwork and chandeliers and then i did the charleston with none other than gloria feldman who made coy hideous faces at me all the time we danced,near the end of the evening brenda who d been drinking champagne like her uncle leo did a rita hayworth tango with herself and julie fell asleep on some ferns she d whisked off the head table and made into a mattress at the far end of the hall,roth
3043,3044,no sooner had she left than leo was beside me a glass in one hand a new bottle of champagne in the other,no sign of the bride and groom he said leering,roth
3045,3046,he d lost most of his consonants by this time and was doing the best he could with long wet vowels,well you re next kid i see it in the cards you re nobody s and he stabbed me in the side with the top of the bottle spilling champagne onto the side of my rented tux,roth
3047,3048,he straightened up poured more onto his hand and glass but then suddenly he stopped,he was looking into the lights which were hidden beneath a long bank of flowers that adorned the front of the table,roth
3049,3050,he shook the bottle in his hand as though to make it fizz,the son of a bitch who invented the fluorescent bulb should drop dead he set the bottle down and drank,roth
3051,3052,up on the stage harry winters brought his musicians to a halt,the drummer stood up stretched and they all began to open up cases and put their instruments away,roth
3053,3054,on the floor relatives friends associates were holding each other around the waists and the shoulders and small children huddled around their parents legs,a couple of kids ran in and out of the crowd screaming at tag until one was grabbed by an adult and slapped soundly on the behind,roth
3055,3056,he began to cry and couple by couple the floor emptied,our table was a tangle of squashed everything napkins fruits flowers there were empty whiskey bottles droopy ferns and dishes puddled with unfinished cherry jubilee gone sticky with the hours,roth
3057,3058,at the end of the table mr,patimkin was sitting next to his wife holding her hand,roth
3059,3060,opposite them on two bridge chairs that had been nulled up sat mr and mrs ehrlich they spoke quietly and evenly as though they had known each other for years and years everything had slowed down now and from time to time people would come up to the patimkins and ehrlichs wish them mazel tov and then drag themselves and their families out into the september night which was cool and windy someone said and reminded me that soon would come winter and snow,they never wear out those things you know that leo was pointing to the fluorescent lights that shone through the flowers,roth
3061,3062,they last for years,they could make a car like that if they wanted that could never wear out,roth
3063,3064,it would ran on water in the summer and snow in the winter,but they wouldn t do it the big boys look at me leo said splashing his suit front with champagne i sell a good bulb,roth
3065,3066,you can t get the kind of bulb i sell in the drugstores,it s a quality bulb,roth
3067,3068,but i m the little guy,i don t even own a car,roth
3069,3070,his brother and i don t even own an automobile,i take a train wherever i go,roth
3071,3072,i m the only guy i know who wears out three pairs of rubbers every winter,most guys get new ones when they lose the old ones,roth
3073,3074,i wear them out like shoes,look he said leaning into me i could sell a crappy bulb it wouldn t break my heart,roth
3075,3076,patimkin who came down the table towards leo and me,he slapped leo on the back,roth
3077,3078,patimkin laughed,when i make out my income tax i go to see leo,roth
3079,3080,he knows just how much money i spent you need a ride home he asked me,no thanks,roth
3081,3082,i m waiting for brenda,patimkin said,roth
3083,3084,i watched him step down off the platform that held the head table and then start towards the exit,now the only people in the shambles of a myself leo and his wife and child who slept both of them with their heads pillowed on a crumpled tablecloth at a table down on the floor before us,roth
3085,3086,brenda still wasn t around,when you got it leo said rubbing his fingers together you can afford to talk like a big shot,roth
3087,3088,who needs a guy like me any more,salesmen you spit on them,roth
3089,3090,you can go to the supermarket and buy anything,where my wife shops you can buy sheets and pillowcases,roth
3091,3092,imagine a grocery store,me i sell to gas stations factories small businesses all up and down the east coast,roth
3093,3094,sure you can sell a guy in a gas station a crappy bulb that ll bum out in a week,for inside the pumps i m talking it takes a certain kind of bulb,roth
3095,3096,a utility bulb,all right so you sell him a crappy bulb and then a week later he puts in a new one and while he s screwing it in he still remembers your name,roth
3097,3098,not me,i sell a quality bulb,roth
3099,3100,it lasts a month five weeks before it even flickers then it gives you another couple days dim maybe but so you shouldn t go blind,it hangs on it s a quality bulb,roth
3101,3102,before it even bums out you notice it s getting darker so you put a new one in,what people don t like is when one minute it s sunlight and the next dark,roth
3103,3104,let it glimmer a few days and they don t feel so bad,nobody ever throws out my figure they ll save them can always use them in a pinch,roth
3105,3106,sometimes i say to a guy you ever throw out a bulb you bought from leo patimkin,you got ta use psychology,roth
3107,3108,that s why i m sending my kid to college,aaach he said and drank off half a glass of champagne,roth
3109,3110,i ll tell you i go as far as new london connecticut,that s as far as i ll go and when i come home at night i stop first for a couple drinks,roth
3111,3112,martinis,two i have sometimes three,roth
3113,3114,that seems fair don t it,but to her a little sip or a bathtubful it smells the same,roth
3115,3116,she says it s bad for the kid if i come home smelling,the kid s a baby for god s sake she thinks that s the way i m supposed to smell,roth
3117,3118,a fortyeightyearold man with a threeyearold kid,she ll give me a thrombosis that kid,roth
3119,3120,my wife she wants me to come home early and play with the kid before she goes to bed,come home she says and i ll make you a drink,roth

3167,3168,i figure she was one of those christian scientists or some cult or something,so i said but what about for soldiers guys going overseas who may get killed god forbid he shrugged his shoulders,roth
3169,3170,the smartest guy in the world i wasn t,but that s twenty years almost i was still wet behind the ears,roth
3171,3172,i ll tell you every once in a while my know she does for me what hannah schreiber did,i don t like to force her she works hard,roth
3173,3174,that to her is like a cab to me,i wouldn t force her,roth
3175,3176,i can remember every time i ll bet,once after a seder my mother was still living she should rest in peace,roth
3177,3178,my wife was up to here with mogen david,in fact twice after seders,roth
3179,3180,aachhh,everything good in my life i can count on my fingers,roth
3181,3182,god forbid some one should leave me a million dollars i wouldn t even have to take off my shoes,you call that a light,roth
3183,3184,that s a light to read by,it s purple for god s sake,roth
3185,3186,half the blind men in the world mined themselves by those damn things,you know who s behind them,roth
3187,3188,the optometrists,i ll tell you if i could get a couple hundred for all my stock and the territory i d sell tomorrow,roth
3189,3190,that s right leo a patimkin one semester accounting city college nights will sell equipment territory good name,i ll buy two inches in the times,roth
3191,3192,the territory is from here to everywhere,i go where i want my own boss no one tells me what to do,roth
3193,3194,you know the bible,let there be there s leo patimkin that s my trademark i ll sell that too,roth
3195,3196,i tell them that slogan the poilishehs they think i m making it up,what good is it to be smart unless you re in on the ground floor,roth
3197,3198,i got more brains in my pinky than ben got in his whole head,why is it he s on top and i m on the bottom,roth
3199,3200,why,believe me if you re born lucky you re lucky and then he exploded into silence,roth
3201,3202,i had the feeling that he was going to cry so i leaned over and whispered to him you better go home he agreed but i had to raise him out of his seat and steer him by one arm down to his wife and child,the little girl could not be awakened and leo and bea asked me to watch her while they went out into the lobby to get their coats,roth
3203,3204,when they returned leo seemed to have dragged himself back to the level of human communication,he shook my hand with real feeling,roth
3205,3206,i was very touched,you ll go far he said to me,roth
3207,3208,you re a smart boy you ll play it safe,bea stood alongside muttering goodbye all the while he spoke,roth
3209,3210,he shook my hand again and then picked the child out of her seat and they turned towards the door,from the back roundshouldered burdened childcarrying they looked like people fleeing a captured city,roth
3211,3212,brenda i discovered was asleep on a couch in the lobby,it was almost four o clock and the two of us and the desk clerk were the only ones in the hotel lobby,roth
3213,3214,at first i did not waken brenda for she was pale and wilted and i knew she had been sick,i sat beside her smoothing her hair back off her ears,roth
3215,3216,how would i ever come to know her i wondered for as she slept i felt i knew no more of her than what i could see in a photograph,i stirred her gently and in a halfsleep she walked beside me out to the car,roth
3217,3218,it was almost dawn when we came out of the jersey side of the lincoln tunnel,i switched down to my parking lights and drove on to the turnpike and there out before me i could see the swampy meadows that spread for miles and miles watery blotchy smelly like an oversight of god,roth
3219,3220,i thought of that other oversight leo patimkin halfbrother to ben,in a few hours he would be on a train heading north and as he passed scarsdale and white plains he would belch and taste champagne and let the flavor linger in his mouth,roth
3221,3222,alongside him on the seat like another passenger would be cartons of bulbs,he would get off at new london or maybe inspired by the sight of his halfbrother he would stay on again hoping for some new luck further north,roth
3223,3224,for the world was leo s territory every city every swamp every road and highway,he could go on to newfoundland if he wanted hudson bay and on up to thule and then slide down the other side of the globe and rap on frosted windows on the russian steppes if he wanted,roth
3225,3226,but he wouldn t,leo was fortyeight years old and he had learned,roth
3227,3228,he pursued discomfort and sorrow all right but if you had a heartful by the time you reached new london what new awfulness could you look forward to in vladivostok,the next day the wind was blowing the fall in and the branches of the weeping willow were fingering at the patimkin front lawn,roth
3229,3230,i drove brenda to the train at noon and she left me,it was cold and in jersey the leavey turned and fell overnight,roth
3231,3232,the following saturday i took a ride up to see the deer and did not even get out of the car for it was too brisk to be standing at the wire fence and so i watched the animals walk and run in the dimness of the late afternoon and after a while everything even the objects of nature the trees the clouds the grass the weeds reminded me of brenda and i drove back down to newark,already we had sent our first letters and i had called her late one night but in the mail and on the phone we had some difficulty discovering one another we had not the style yet,roth
3233,3234,that night i tried her again and someone on her floor said she was out and would not be in till late,upon my return to the library i was questioned by mr,roth
3235,3236,scapello about the gauguin book,the jowly gentleman had sent a nasty letter about my discourtesy and i was only able to extricate myself by offering a confused story in an indignant tone,roth
3237,3238,in fact i even managed to turn it around so that mr,scapello was apologizing to me as he led me up to my new post there among the encyclopedias the bibliographies the indexes and guides,roth
3239,3240,my bullying surprised me and i wondered if some of it had not been learned from mr,patimkin that morning i d heard him giving grossman an earful on the phone,roth
3241,3242,perhaps i was more of a businessman than i thought,i wondered what it had been like that day the colored kid had discovered the book was gone,roth
3243,3244,had he cried,for some reason i imagined that he had blamed it on me but then i realized that i was confusing the dream i d had with reality,roth
3245,3246,chances were he had discovered someone else van gogh vermeer but no they were not his kind of artists,what had probably happened was that he d given up on the library and gone back to playing willie mays in the streets,roth
3247,3248,he was better off i thought,no sense carrying dreams of tahiti in your head if you can t afford the fare,roth
3249,3250,let s see what else did i do,i ate i slept i went to the movies i sent brokenspined books to the did everything i d ever done before but now each activity was surrounded by a fence existed alone and my life consisted of jumping from one fence to the next,roth
3251,3252,there was no flow for that had been brenda,and then brenda wrote saying that she could be coming in for the jewish holidays which were only a week away,roth
3253,3254,i was so overjoyed i wanted to call mr,and mrs,roth
3255,3256,patimkin just to tell them of my pleasure,however when i got to the phone and had actually dialed the first two letters i knew that at the other end there would be silence if there was anything said it would only be mrs,roth
3257,3258,patimkin asking what is it you want mr,patimkin had probably forgotten my name,roth
3259,3260,that night after dinner i gave aunt gladys a kiss and told her she shouldn t work so hard,in less than a week it s rosh hashana and he thinks i should take a vacation,roth
3261,3262,ten people i m having,what do you think a chicken cleans itself,roth
3263,3264,oy gut aunt gladys called,what is it aunt gladys tugged at my shirt,roth
3265,3266,brenda i said,yes brenda said,roth
3267,3268,brenda aunt gladys said,honey i can t,roth
3269,3270,tuesdays i said glumly,you sound upset,roth
3271,3272,it is the jewish holidays,good night love i said,roth
3273,3274,aunt gladys cried when i told her i was going away for rosh hashana,and i was preparing a big meal she said,roth
3275,3276,please,scapello didn t want me to leave on rosh hashana either but i unnerved him i think by hinting that his coldness about my taking the two days off might just be so much veiled antisemitism so on the whole he was easier to manage,roth
3277,3278,at lunch time i took a walk down to penn station and picked up a train schedule to boston,that was my bedtime reading for the next three nights,roth
3279,3280,she did not look like brenda at least for the first minute,and probably to her i did not look like me,roth
3281,3282,but we kissed and held each other and it was strange to feel the thickness of our coats between us,i m letting my hair grow she said in the cab and that in fact was all she said,roth
3283,3284,not until i helped her out of the cab did i notice the thin gold band shining on her left hand,she hung back strolling casually about the lobby while i signed the register mr,roth
3285,3286,and mrs,neil klugman and then in the room we kissed again,roth
3287,3288,your heart s pounding i said to her,i know she said,roth
3289,3290,i sat down on the bed she didn t,i hung her coat and mine in the empty closet and left the and by the bed,roth
3291,3292,brenda was kneeling backwards in the chair looking out the window as though out the window was where she d rather be,i came up behind her and put my hands around her body and held her breasts and when i felt the cool draft that swept under the sill i realized how long it had been since that first warm night when i had put my arms around her and felt the tiny wings beating in her back,roth
3293,3294,and then i realized why i d really come to had been long enough,it was time to stop kidding about marriage,roth
3295,3296,is something the matter i said,but i asked what is it,roth
3297,3298,that s okay,i told my aunt i was coming here too,roth
3299,3300,i sat in the chair,when i asked,roth
3301,3302,the other day i guess she walked to the bureau and opened her purse,here you can read them in the order i got them she tossed an envelope at me it was dirtyedged and crumpled as though it had been in and out of her pockets a good many times,roth
3303,3304,i got this one this morning she said,i love you honey if you want a coat i ll buy you a coat,roth
3305,3306,you could always have anything you wanted,we have every faith in you so you won t be too upset by what your mother says in her letter,roth
3307,3308,of course she is a little hystericall because of the shock and she has been working so hard for hadassah,she is a woman and it is hard for her to understand some of the shocks in life,roth
3309,3310,of course i can t say we weren t all surprised because from the beginning i was nice to him and thought he would appreciate the nice vacation we supplied for him,some people never turn out the way you hope and pray but i am willing to forgive and call buy gones buy gones you have always up till now been a good buck and got good scholastic grades and ron has always been what we wanted a good boy most important and a nice boy,roth
3311,3312,this late in my life believe me i am not going to start hating my own flesh and blood,as for your mistake it takes two to make a mistake and now that you will be away at school and from him and what you got involved in you will probably do all right i have every faith you will,roth
3313,3314,you have to have faith in your children like in a business or any serious undertaking and there is nothing that is so bad that we can t forgive especially when our own flesh and blood is involved,we have a nice close nitt family and why not,roth
3315,3316,have a nice holiday and in temple i will say a prayer for you as i do every year,on monday i want you to go into boston and buy a coat,roth
3317,3318,whatever you need because i know how cold it gets up where you are give my regards to linda and remember to bring her home with you on thanksgiving like last year,you two had such a nice time,roth
3319,3320,i have always never said bad things about any of your friends or rons and that this should happen is only the exception that proves the rule,have a happy holiday,roth
3321,3322,my roommate last year she tossed another envelope to me,here,roth
3323,3324,i got this one in the afternoon,i started to read it and then put it down a moment,roth
3325,3326,when i got his i didn t know what was happening,i have been crying all morning and have had to skip my board meeting this afternoon because my eyes are so red,roth
3327,3328,i never thought this would happen to a daughter of mine,i wonder if you know what i mean if it is at least on your conscience so i won t have to degrade either of us with a description,roth
3329,3330,all i can say is that this morning when i was cleaning out the drawers and putting away your summer clothing i came upon something in your bottom drawer under some sweaters which you probably remember leaving there,i cried the minute i saw it and i haven t stopped crying yet,roth
3331,3332,your father called a while ago and now he is driving home because he heard how upset i was on the phone,i don t know what we ever did that you should reward us this way,roth
3333,3334,we gave you a nice home and all the love and respect a child needs,i always was proud when you were a little girl that you could take care of yourself so well,roth
3335,3336,you took care of julie so beautifully it was a treat to see when you were only fourteen years old,but you drifted away from your family even though we sent you to the best schools and gave you the best money could buy,roth
3337,3338,why you should reward us this way is a question i ll carry with me to the grave,about your friend i have no words,roth
3339,3340,he is his parents responsibility and i can not imagine what kind of home life he had that he could act that way,certainly that was a fine way to repay us for the hospitality we were nice enough to show to him a perfect stranger,roth
3341,3342,that the two of you should be carrying on like that in our very house i will never in my life be able to understand,times certainly have changed since i was a girl that this kind of thing could go on,roth
3343,3344,i keep asking myself if at least you didn t think of us while you were doing that,if not for me how could you do this to your father,roth
3345,3346,god forbid julie should ever learn of this,god only knows what you have been doing all these years we put our trust in you,roth
3347,3348,you have broken your parents hearts and you should know that,this is some thank you for all we gave you,roth
3349,3350,brenda i said,suppose you did come home and then you came back again,roth
3351,3352,the stars and moon were out silver and hard and from the window i could see over to the harvard campus where lights burned and then seemed to flicker when the trees blew across them,or maybe she did,roth
3353,3354,neil i couldn t think of everything,do you believe that she said after neither of us had spoken for a full minute,roth
3355,3356,it wasn t an oversight about leaving it she said,brenda sweetheart wouldn t the safest smartest easiest simplest thing been to have taken it with you,roth
3357,3358,do you think i need this,do you,roth
3359,3360,what happens now bren i said,don t start crying i said,roth
3361,3362,patimkin s from its envelope,why does your father capitalize all these letters she didn t answer,roth
3363,3364,as for your mistake i read aloud to brenda it takes two to make a mistake and now that you will be away at school and from him and what you got involved in you will probably do all right i have every faith you will,your father,roth
3365,3366,i have always never said bad things about any of your friends or rons and that this should happen is only the exception that proves the rale,have a happy holiday i stopped in brenda s face there was positively no threat of tears she looked suddenly solid and decisive,roth
3367,3368,well what are you going to do i asked,after this can i bring you home,roth
3369,3370,you can bring linda or me,you can go home or not go home,roth
3371,3372,that s another choice,they re still my parents,roth
3373,3374,they did send me to the best schools didn t they,your parents don t bother you any more,roth
3375,3376,i understand why the hell you left that thing lying around,don t you,roth
3377,3378,you re the one who doesn t understand,you re the one who from the very beginning was accusing me of things,roth
3379,3380,remember,isn t it so,roth
3381,3382,why don t you have your eyes fixed,why don t you have this fixed that fixed,roth
3383,3384,as if it were my fault that i could have them fixed,you kept acting as if i was going to ran away from you every minute,roth
3385,3386,a few minutes later i picked up my bag and put on my coat,i think brenda was crying too when i went out the door,roth
3387,3388,instead of grabbing a cab immediately i walked down the street and out towards the harvard yard which i had never seen before,i entered one of the gates and then headed out along a path under the tired autumn foliage and the dark sky,roth
3389,3390,i wanted to be alone in the dark not because i wanted to think about anything but rather because for just a while i wanted to think about nothing,i walked clear across the yard and up a little hill and then i was standing in front of the lamont library which brenda had once told me had patimkin sinks in its rest rooms,roth
3391,3392,from the light of the lamp on the path behind me i could see my reflection in the glass front of the building,inside it was dark and there were no students to be seen no librarians,roth
3393,3394,suddenly i wanted to set down my suitcase and pick up a rock and heave it right through the glass but of course i didn t,i simply looked at myself in the mirror the light made of the window,roth
3395,3396,i was only that substance i thought those limbs that face that i saw in front of me,i looked but the outside of me gave up little information about the inside of me,roth
3397,3398,i wished i could scoot around to the other side of the window faster than light or sound or herb clark on homecoming day to get behind that image and catch whatever it was that looked through those eyes,what was it inside me that had turned pursuit and clutching into love and then turned it inside out again,roth
3399,3400,what was it that had turned winning into losing and winning,i was sure i had loved brenda though standing there i knew i couldn t any longer,roth
3401,3402,and i knew it would be a long while before i made love to anyone the way i had made love to her,with anyone else could i summon up such a passion,roth
3403,3404,whatever spawned my love for her had that spawned such lust too,if she had only been slightly not brenda but then would i have loved her,roth
3405,3406,i looked hard at the image of me at that darkening of the glass and then my gaze pushed through it over the cool floor to a broken wall of books imperfectly shelved,i did not look very much longer but took a train that got me into newark just as the sun was rising on the first day of the jewish new year,roth
3407,3408,i was back in plenty of time for work,he did,roth
3409,3410,i didn t even know what he was talking about,jesus is historical he kept saying,roth
3411,3412,jesus is historical ozzie mimicked the monumental voice of rabbi binder,jesus was a person that lived like you and me ozzie continued,roth
3413,3414,so what,what do i give two cents whether he lived or not,roth
3415,3416,and what do you got ta open your mouth itzie lieberman favored closedmouthedness especially when it came to ozzie freedman s questions,mrs,roth
3417,3418,freedman had to see rabbi binder twice before about ozzie s questions and this wednesday at fourthirty would be the third time,itzie preferred to keep his mother in the kitchen he settled for behindtheback subtleties such as gestures faces snarls and other less delicate barnyard noises,roth
3419,3420,he was a real person jesus but he wasn t like god and we don t believe he is god slowly ozzie was explaining rabbi binder s position to itzie who had been absent from hebrew school the previous afternoon,the catholics itzie said helpfully they believe in jesus christ that he s god itzie lieberman used the catholics in its broadest include the protestants,roth
3421,3422,ozzie received itzie s remark with a tiny head bob as though it were a footnote and went on,his mother was mary and his father probably was joseph ozzie said,roth
3423,3424,that stuff s all bull,to have a baby you got ta get laid itzie theologized,roth
3425,3426,he said that intercourse a little curled smile shaped itself in the lower half of itzie s face like a pink mustache,but making light i mean when you think about it it s really something ozzie said,roth
3427,3428,i mean no kidding around ozzie said that d really be nothing,so i said i understood that,roth
3429,3430,the first time he had wanted to know how rabbi binder could call the jews the chosen people if the declaration of independence claimed all men to be created equal,rabbi binder tried to distinguish for him between political equality and spiritual legitimacy but what ozzie wanted to know he insisted vehemently was different,roth
3431,3432,that was the first time his mother had to come,then there was the plane crash,roth
3433,3434,fiftyeight people had been killed in a plane crash at la guardia,in studying a casualty list in the newspaper his mother had discovered among the list of those dead eight jewish names his grandmother had nine but she counted miller as a jewish name because of the eight she said the plane crash was a tragedy during freediscussion time on wednesday ozzie had brought to rabbi binder s attention this matter of some of his relations always picking out the jewish names,roth
3435,3436,rabbi binder had begun to explain cultural unity and some other things when ozzie stood up at his seat and said that what he wanted to know was different,rabbi binder insisted that he sit down and it was then that ozzie shouted that he wished all fiftyeight were jews,roth
3437,3438,that was the second time his mother came,and he kept explaining about jesus being historical and so i kept asking him,roth
3439,3440,and that i d never get barmitzvahed if he could help it,then itz then he starts talking in that voice like a statue real slow and deep and he says that i better think over what i said about the lord,roth
3441,3442,he told me to go to his office and think it over ozzie leaned his body towards itzie,but it was a friday night in november and already dark and when mrs,roth
3443,3444,freedman came through the door she tossed off her coat kissed ozzie quickly on the face and went to the kitchen table to light the three yellow candles two for the sabbath and one for ozzie s father,when his mother lit the candles she would move her two arms slowly towards her dragging them through the air as though persuading people whose minds were half made up,roth
3445,3446,and her eyes would get glassy with tears,even when his father was alive ozzie remembered that her eyes had gotten glassy so it didn t have anything to do with his dying,roth
3447,3448,it had something to do with lighting the candles,as she touched the flaming match to the unlit wick of a sabbath candle the phone rang and ozzie standing only a foot from it plucked it off the receiver and held it muffled to his chest,roth
3449,3450,when his mother lit candles ozzie felt there should be no noise even breathing if you could manage it should be softened,ozzie pressed the phone to his breast and watched his mother dragging whatever she was dragging and he felt his own eyes get glassy,roth
3451,3452,his mother was a round tired grayhaired penguin of a woman whose gray skin had begun to feel the tug of gravity and the weight of her own history,even when she was dressed up she didn t look like a chosen person,roth
3453,3454,but when she lit candles she looked like something better like a woman who knew momentarily that god could do anything,after a few mysterious minutes she was finished,roth
3455,3456,ozzie hung up the phone and walked to the kitchen table where she was beginning to lay the two places for the fourcourse sabbath meal,he told her that she would have to see rabbi binder next wednesday at fourthirty and then he told her why,roth
3457,3458,for the first time in their life together she hit ozzie across the face with her hand,all through the chopped liver and chicken soup part of the dinner ozzie cried he didn t have any appetite for the rest,roth
3459,3460,on wednesday in the largest of the three basement classrooms of the synagogue rabbi marvin binder a tall handsome broadshouldered man of thirty with thick strongfibered black hair removed his watch from his pocket and saw that it was four o clock,at the rear of the room yakoy blotnik the seventyoneyearold custodian slowly polished the large window mumbling to himself unaware that it was four o clock or six o clock monday or wednesday,roth
3461,3462,to most of the students yakoy blotnik s mumbling along with his brown curly beard scythe nose and two heeltrailing black cats made of him an object of wonder a foreigner a relic towards whom they were alternately fearful and disrespectful,to ozzie the mumbling had always seemed a monotonous curious prayer what made it curious was that old blotnik had been mumbling so steadily for so many years ozzie suspected he had memorized the prayers and forgotten all about god,roth
3463,3464,it is now freediscussion time rabbi binder said,it was a gusty clouded november afternoon and it did not seem as though there ever was or could be a thing called baseball,roth
3465,3466,so nobody this week said a word about that hero from the past hank limited free discussion considerably,and the soulbattering ozzie freedman had just received from rabbi binder had imposed its limitation,roth
3467,3468,when it was ozzie s turn to read aloud from the hebrew book the rabbi had asked him petulantly why he didn t read more rapidly,he was showing no progress,roth
3469,3470,ozzie said he could read faster but that if he did he was sure not to understand what he was reading,nevertheless at the rabbi s repeated suggestion ozzie tried and showed a great talent but in the midst of a long passage he stopped short and said he didn t understand a word he was reading and started in again at a dragfooted pace,roth
3471,3472,then came the soulbattering,consequently when freediscussion time rolled around none of the students felt too free,roth
3473,3474,the rabbi s invitation was answered only by the mumbling of feeble old blotnik,isn t there anything at all you would like to discuss rabbi binder asked again looking at his watch,roth
3475,3476,the rabbi requested that ozzie rise and give the rest of the class the advantage of his thought,ozzie rose,roth
3477,3478,i forget it now he said and sat down in his place,rabbi binder advanced a seat towards ozzie and poised himself on the edge of the desk,roth
3479,3480,it was itzie s desk and the rabbi s frame only a dagger slength away from his face snapped him to sitting attention,all his classmates turned in their seats and watched as he gave an unconvincing scratch to his forehead,roth
3481,3482,i can t assemble any he announced and plunked himself down,stand up rabbi binder advanced from itzie s desk to the one directly in front of ozzie when the rabbinical back was turned itzie gave it fivefingers off the tip of his nose causing a small titter in the room,roth
3483,3484,rabbi binder was too absorbed in squelching ozzie s nonsense once and for all to bother with titters,stand up oscar,roth
3485,3486,it was the handiest word,binder twisted quickly to see what had happened and in the midst of the commotion ozzie shouted into the rabbi s back what he couldn t have shouted to his face,roth
3487,3488,it was a loud toneless sound that had the timbre of something stored inside for about six days,you don t know,roth
3489,3490,perhaps it had only been meant to clamp the boy s mouth shut but ozzie ducked and the palm caught him squarely on the nose,the blood came in a short red spurt on to ozzie s shirt front,roth
3491,3492,the next moment was all confusion,ozzie screamed you bastard you bastard and broke for the classroom door,roth
3493,3494,rabbi binder lurched a step backwards as though his own blood had started flowing violently in the opposite direction then gave a clumsy lurch forward and bolted out the door after ozzie,the class followed after the rabbi s huge bluesuited back and before old blotnik could turn from his window the room was empty and everyone was headed full speed up the three flights leading to the roof,roth
3495,3496,if one should compare the light of day to the life of man sunrise to birth dropping down over the death then as ozzie freedman wiggled through the trapdoor of the synagogue roof his feet kicking backwards broncostyle at rabbi binder s outstretched that moment the day was fifty years old,as a rule fifty or fiftyfive reflects accurately the age of late afternoons in november for it is in that month during those hours thai one s awareness of light seems no longer a matter of seeing but of hearing light begins clicking away,roth
3497,3498,in fact as ozzie locked shut the trapdoor in the rabbi s face the sharp click of the bolt into the lock might momentarily have been mistaken for the sound of the heavier gray that had just throbbed through the sky,with all his weight ozzie kneeled on the locked door any instant he was certain that rabbi binder s shoulder would fling it open splintering the wood into shrapnel and catapulting his body into the sky,roth
3499,3500,but the door did not move and below him he heard only the rumble of feet first loud then dim like thunder rolling away,a question shot through his brain,roth
3501,3502,can this be me for a thirteenyearold who had just labeled his religious leader a bastard twice it was not an improper question,louder and louder the question came to is it me,roth
3503,3504,is it me he discovered himself no longer kneeling but racing crazily towards the edge of the roof his eyes crying his throat screaming and his arms flying everywhichway as though not his own,is it me,roth
3505,3506,is it me me me me me,in the few wild seconds it took ozzie s body to propel him to the edge of the roof his selfexamination began to grow fuzzy,roth
3507,3508,gazing down at the street he became confused as to the problem beneath the question was it isitmewhocalledbinderabastard,or isitmeprancingaroundon theroof,roth
3509,3510,however the scene below settled all for there is an instant in any action when whether it is you or somebody else is academic,the thief crams the money in his pockets and scoots out the window,roth
3511,3512,the bridegroom signs the hotel register for two,and the boy on the roof finds a streetful of people gaping at him necks stretched backwards faces up as though he were the ceiling of the hayden planetarium,roth
3513,3514,suddenly you know it s you,oscar,roth
3515,3516,oscar freedman a voice rose from the center of the crowd a voice that could it have been seen would have looked like the writing on scroll,oscar freedman get down from there,roth
3517,3518,immediately rabbi binder was pointing one arm stiffly up at him and at the end of that arm one finger aimed menacingly,it was the attitude of a dictator but eyes confessed personal valet had spit neatly in his face,roth
3519,3520,ozzie didn t answer,only for a blink s length did he look towards rabbi binder,roth
3521,3522,instead his eyes began to fit together the world beneath him to sort out people from places friends from enemies participants from spectators,in little jagged starlike clusters his friends stood around rabbi binder who was still pointing,roth
3523,3524,the topmost point on a star compounded not of angels but of five adolescent boys was itzie,what a world it was with those stars below rabbi binder below ozzie who a moment earlier hadn t been able to control his own body started to feel the meaning of the word control he felt peace and he felt power,roth
3525,3526,all right then said rabbi binder,he ran a hand through his black samson hair as though it were the gesture prescribed for uttering the first digit,roth
3527,3528,then with his other hand cutting a circle out of the small piece of sky around him he spoke,on the contrary at that moment as though one was the cue for which he had been waiting the world s least thunderous person appeared on the synagogue steps,roth
3529,3530,he did not so much come out the synagogue door as lean out onto the darkening air,he clutched at the doorknob with one hand and looked up at the roof,roth
3531,3532,for yakoy blotnik life had fractionated itself simply things were either goodforthejews or nogoodforthejews,he smacked his free hand to his insucked cheek gently,roth
3533,3534,oy gut and then quickly as he was able he jacked down his head and surveyed the street,there was rabbi binder like a man at an auction with only three dollars in his pocket he had just delivered a shaky two there were the students and that was all,roth
3535,3536,so far itwasn tsobadforthejews,but the boy had to come down immediately before anybody saw,roth
3537,3538,the problem how to get the boy off the roof,anybody who has ever had a cat on the roof knows how to get him down,roth
3539,3540,you call the fire department,or first you call the operator and you ask her for the fire department,roth
3541,3542,and the next thing there is great jamming of brakes and clanging of bells and shouting of instructions,and then the cat is off the roof,roth
3543,3544,you do the same thing to get a boy off the roof,that is you do the same thing if you are yakoy blotnik and you once had a cat on the roof,roth
3545,3546,when the engines all four of them arrived rabbi binder had four times given ozzie the count of three,the big hookandladder swung around the comer and one of the firemen leaped from it plunging headlong towards the yellow fire hydrant in front of the synagogue,roth
3547,3548,with a huge wrench he began to unscrew the top nozzle,rabbi binder raced over to him and pulled at his shoulder,roth
3549,3550,but there s no fire there s no binder shouted,when the fireman mumbled again the rabbi grasped his face with both his hands and pointed it up at the roof,roth
3551,3552,to ozzie it looked as though rabbi binder was trying to tug the fireman s head out of his body like a cork from a bottle,he had to giggle at the picture they made it was a family in black skullcap fireman in red fire hat and the little yellow hydrant squatting beside like a kid brother bareheaded,roth
3553,3554,from the edge of the roof ozzie waved at the portrait a onehanded flapping mocking wave in doing it his right foot slipped from under him,rabbi binder covered his eyes with his hands,roth
3555,3556,firemen work fast,before ozzie had even regained his balance a big round yellowed net was being held on the synagogue lawn,roth
3557,3558,the firemen who held it looked up at ozzie with stern feelingless faces,one of the firemen turned his head towards rabbi binder,roth
3559,3560,then he checked nothing on the sidewalk no dents in the net,is he gon na jump or what the fireman shouted,roth
3561,3562,in a voice not at all like a statue rabbi binder finally answered,why the reason he was on the roof ozzie remembered was to get away he hadn t even thought about jumping,roth
3563,3564,he had just run to get away and the truth was that he hadn t really headed for the roof as much as he d been chased there,what is it with you oscar,roth
3565,3566,frankly the question had just arisen,look oscar if you re gon na jump if you re not gon na jump don t jump,roth
3567,3568,he wanted to see rabbi binder cover his eyes one more time,he began screaming like some kind of engine wheeeee wheeeeee and leaning way out over the edge with the upper half of his body,roth
3569,3570,the firemen whipped around to cover the ground with the net,rabbi binder mumbled a few words to somebody and covered his eyes,roth
3571,3572,everything happened quickly jerkily as in a silent movie,the crowd which had arrived with the fire engines gave out a long fourthofjuly fireworks ooohaahhh,roth
3573,3574,in the excitement no one had paid the crowd much heed except of course yakoy blotnik who swung from the doorknob counting heads,fier und tsvansik finf und tsvantsik oy gut it wasn t like this with the cat,roth
3575,3576,rabbi binder peeked through his fingers checked the sidewalk and net,empty,roth
3577,3578,but there was ozzie racing to the other comer,the firemen raced with him but were unable to keep up,roth
3579,3580,whenever ozzie wanted to he might jump and splatter himself upon the sidewalk and by the time the firemen scooted to the spot all they could do with their net would be to cover the mess,rabbi binder couldn t take it any fire engines from nowhere the screaming suicidal boy the net,roth
3581,3582,he fell to his knees exhausted and with his hands curled together in front of his chest like a little dome he pleaded oscar stop it oscar,don t jump oscar,roth
3583,3584,ozzie momentarily stopped flapping,go ahead itzie broke off his point of the star and courageously with the inspiration not of a wiseguy but of a disciple stood alone,roth
3585,3586,he looked at itzie then agonizingly back to ozzie,oscar don t jump,roth
3587,3588,by the time mrs,freedman arrived to keep her fourthirty appointment with rabbi binder the whole little upside down heaven was shouting and pleading for ozzie to jump and rabbi binder no longer was pleading with him not to jump but was crying into the dome of his hands,roth
3589,3590,understandably mrs,freedman couldn t figure out what her son was doing on the roof,roth
3591,3592,so she asked,ozzie my ozzie what are you doing,roth
3593,3594,he stood against the low clouded darkening clicked down swiftly now as on a small softly and gazing down at the small bundle of a woman who was his mother,what are you doing ozzie she turned towards the kneeling rabbi binder and rushed so close that only a paperthickness of dusk lay between her stomach and his shoulders,roth
3595,3596,all that moved was the dome of his hands it shook back and forth like a weak pulse,rabbi get him down,roth
3597,3598,he ll kill himself,it s them,roth
3599,3600,freedman saw the crowd of boys and she heard what they were yelling,he s doing it for them,roth
3601,3602,he won t listen to me,it s them rabbi binder spoke like one in a trance,roth
3603,3604,freedman raised her two arms upward as though she were conducting the sky,for them he s doing it and then in a gesture older than pyramids older than prophets and floods her arms came slapping down to her sides,roth
3605,3606,a martyr i have,look she tilted her head to the roof,roth
3607,3608,ozzie was still flapping softly,in a startlingly even voice mrs,roth
3609,3610,freedman called to the boy on the roof,ozzie come down ozzie,roth
3611,3612,don t be a martyr my baby,be a martin be a martin and all the voices joined in singing for martindom whatever it was,roth
3613,3614,all ozzie knew was that two groups wanted two new things his friends were spirited and musical about what they wanted his mother and the rabbi were eventoned chanting about what they didn t want,the rabbi s voice was without tears now and so was his mother s,roth
3615,3616,the big net stared up at ozzie like a sightless eye,the big clouded sky pushed down,roth
3617,3618,from beneath it looked like a gray corrugated board,suddenly looking up into that unsympathetic sky ozzie realized all the strangeness of what these people his friends were asking they wanted him to jump to kill himself they were singing about it made them that happy,roth
3619,3620,and there was an even greater strangeness rabbi binder was on his knees trembling,if he jumped would the singing become dancing,roth
3621,3622,would it,what would jumping stop,roth
3623,3624,yearningly ozzie wished he could rip open the sky plunge his hands through and pull out the sun and on the sun like a coin would be stamped jump or don t jump,ozzie s knees rocked and sagged a little under him as though they were setting him for a dive,roth
3625,3626,his arms tightened stiffened froze from shoulders to fingernails,he felt as if each part of his body were going to vote as to whether he should kill himself or each part as though it were independent of him,roth
3627,3628,the light took an unexpected click down and the new darkness like a gag hushed the friends singing for this and the mother and rabbi chanting for that,ozzie stopped counting votes and in a curiously high voice like one who wasn t prepared for speech he spoke,roth
3629,3630,she was kneeling beside rabbi binder,he spoke again,roth
3631,3632,everybody kneel there was the sound of everybody kneeling,ozzie looked around,roth
3633,3634,with one hand he pointed towards the synagogue entrance,ozzie could hear rabbi binder saying in a gruff whisper he ll kill himself and when next he looked there was yakoy blotnik off the doorknob and for the first time in his life upon his knees in the gentile posture of prayer,roth
3635,3636,as for the is not as difficult as one might imagine to hold a net taut while you are kneeling,ozzie looked around again and then he called to rabbi binder,roth
3637,3638,make him tell me there was no doubt who him was,in a few moments ozzie heard an old comical voice say something to the increasing darkness about god,roth
3639,3640,next ozzie made everybody say it,and then he made them all say they believed in jesus one at a time then all together,roth
3641,3642,when the catechizing was through it was the beginning of evening,from the street it sounded as if the hoy on the roof might have sighed,roth
3643,3644,ozzie a woman s voice dared to speak,mamma don t you shouldn t hit me,roth
3645,3646,he shouldn t hit me,you shouldn t hit me about god mamma,roth
3647,3648,once again there was silence,i can come down now mamma the boy on the roof finally said,roth
3649,3650,he turned his head both ways as though checking the traffic lights,along with the rest of the ninth army i had been racing across germany so swiftly during the late winter and spring that when i boarded the plane i couldn t believe its destination lay to the west,roth
3651,3652,my mind might inform me otherwise but there was an inertia of the spirit that told me we were flying to a new front where we would disembark and continue our push until we d circled the globe marching through villages along whose twisting cobbled streets crowds of the enemy would watch us take possession of what up till then they d considered their own,i had changed enough in two years not to mind the trembling of the old people the crying of the very young the uncertainty and fear in the eyes of the once arrogant i had been fortunate enough to develop an infantryman s heart which like his feet at first aches and swells but finally grows horny enough for him to travel the weirdest paths without feeling a thing,roth
3653,3654,captain paul barrett was my co,in camp crowder,roth
3655,3656,the day i reported for duty he came out of his office to shake my hand,he was short gruff and fiery or wore his polished helmet liner pulled down to his little eyes,roth
3657,3658,in europe he had received a battlefield commission and a serious chest wound and he d been returned to the states only a few months before,he spoke easily to me and at the evening formation he introduced me to the troops,roth
3659,3660,the charge of quarters slept with his mouth open on a mattress on the floor,a trainee stood reading the next day s duty roster which was posted on the bulletin board just inside the screen door,roth
3661,3662,it was a warm evening and i could hear radios playing dance music over in the barracks,the trainee who had been staring at me whenever he thought i wouldn t notice finally took a step in my direction,roth
3663,3664,hey having a gi,party tomorrow night he asked,roth
3665,3666,a gi,party is a barracks cleaning,roth
3667,3668,you usually have them on friday nights i asked him,his shoulders were moving and i wondered if he was crying,roth
3669,3670,what s your name soldier i asked,he turned not crying at all,roth
3671,3672,instead his greenspeckled eyes long and narrow flashed like fish in the sun,he walked over to me and sat on the edge of my desk,roth
3673,3674,he reached out a hand,sheldon he said,roth
3675,3676,you against cleaning the barracks friday night grossbart i said,maybe we shouldn t have gi,roth
3677,3678,parties,maybe we should get a maid my tone startled me,roth
3679,3680,i felt i sounded like every top sergeant i had ever known,no sergeant he grew serious but with a seriousness that seemed to be only the stifling of a smile,roth
3681,3682,it s,he looked at me with those speckled eyes flashing and then made a gesture with his hand,roth
3683,3684,it was very more than a movement back and forth of the yet it managed to exclude from our affairs everything else in the orderly room to make the two of us the center of the world,it seemed in fact to exclude everything even about the two of us except our hearts,roth
3685,3686,what s on your mind whether i was still angry at the sheldon business or now at something else i hadn t time to tell but clearly i was angry,we thought you know like karl marx,roth
3687,3688,the marx brothers,those guys are,roth
3689,3690,what i mean to say his face and neck were red and his mouth moved but no words came out,in a moment he raised himself to attention gazing down at me,roth
3691,3692,it was as though he had suddenly decided he could expect no more sympathy from me than from thurston the reason being that i was of thurston s faith and not his,the young man had managed to confuse himself as to what my faith really was but i felt no desire to straighten him out,roth
3693,3694,very simply i didn t like him,when i did nothing but return his gaze he spoke in an altered tone,roth
3695,3696,it s the other guys in the barracks he leaned toward me,they think we re goofing off,roth
3697,3698,but we re not,that s when jews go to services friday night,roth
3699,3700,there s nothing i can do about it i said,grossbart stiffened and stood in front of me,roth
3701,3702,i mean sergeant he said almost snarling,look go see the chaplain,roth
3703,3704,i don t want to make trouble sergeant,that s the first thing they throw up to you,roth
3705,3706,you have your rights,spittle gleamed at the comers of his mouth,roth
3707,3708,near me i heard the scrunching of a guard s boots on gravel,beyond the lighted windows of the barracks young men in t shirts and fatigue pants were sitting on their bunks polishing their rifles,roth
3709,3710,suddenly there was a light rustling behind me,i turned and saw grossbart s dark frame fleeing back to the barracks racing to tell his jewish friends that they were like karl and harpo i was one of them,roth
3711,3712,the next morning while chatting with captain barrett i recounted the incident of the previous evening,somehow in the telling it must have seemed to the captain that i was not so much explaining grossbart s position as defending it,roth
3713,3714,marx i d fight side by side with a nigger if the fella proved to me he was a man,i pride myself he said looking out the window that i ve got an open mind,roth
3715,3716,consequently sergeant nobody gets special treatment here for the good or the bad,all a man s got to do is prove himself,roth
3717,3718,a man fires well on the range i give him a weekend pass,he scores high in pt he gets a weekend pass,roth
3719,3720,he earns it he turned from the window and pointed a finger at me,i admire you because of the ribbons on your chest,roth
3721,3722,i judge a man by what he shows me on the field of battle sergeant,it s what he s got here he said and then though i expected he would point to his chest he jerked a thumb toward the buttons straining to hold his blouse across his belly,roth
3723,3724,guts he said,ok sir,roth
3725,3726,marx you re going to be old before your time if you worry about how the men feel,leave that stuff to the s his business not yours,roth
3727,3728,let s us train these fellas to shoot straight,if the jewish personnel feels the other men are accusing them of i just don t know,roth
3729,3730,synagogue is right sergeant,i ll write that down for handy reference,roth
3731,3732,lahill was a dark burly fellow whose hair curled out of his clothes wherever it could,he had a glaze in his eyes that made one think of caves and dinosaurs,roth
3733,3734,lahill i said church,you remember,roth
3735,3736,jewish personnel who want to attend services this evening are to fall out in front of the orderly room at i said,they looked at their watches and fidgeted while they whispered back and forth,roth
3737,3738,it was getting dimmer and alone on the otherwise deserted field they looked tiny,when i opened the door i heard the noises of the gi,roth
3739,3740,party coming from the surrounding being pushed to the walls faucets pounding water into buckets brooms whisking at the wooden floors cleaning the dirt away for saturday s inspection,big puffs of cloth moved round and round on the windowpanes,roth
3741,3742,i walked outside and the moment my foot hit the ground i thought i heard grossbart call to the others tenhut or maybe when they all three jumped to attention i imagined i heard the command,grossbart stepped forward,roth
3743,3744,thank you sir he said,sergeant grossbart i reminded him,roth
3745,3746,you call officers sir i m not an officer,thank you anyway he said,roth
3747,3748,yes a tall boy behind him said,for what i asked,roth
3749,3750,grossbart snorted happily,for the announcement,roth
3751,3752,the corporal s announcement,it helped,roth
3753,3754,grossbart smiled,he means formal sir,roth
3755,3756,public he said to me,aaah but you pull a little weight grossbart said,roth
3757,3758,so we thank you then he turned to his companions,i shook it,roth
3759,3760,you from new york he asked,he was blinking his eyes a good deal as though he were fighting back tears,roth
3761,3762,what borough he asked,i turned to grossbart,roth
3763,3764,it s five after seven,i want you to meet mickey halpern,roth
3765,3766,private michael halpern he saluted,salute officers halpern i said,roth
3767,3768,the boy dropped his hand and on its way down in his nervousness checked to see if his shirt pockets were buttoned,shall i march them over sir grossbart asked,roth
3769,3770,afterward they re having refreshments,a ladies auxiliary from st,roth
3771,3772,you re welcome to come along grossbart said,to avoid his plea i looked away and saw in the windows of the barracks a cloud of faces staring out at the four of us,roth
3773,3774,hurry along grossbart i said,ok then he said,roth
3775,3776,he turned to the others,even after they had disappeared over the parade ground whose green was now a deep blue i could hear grossbart singing the doubletime cadence and as it grew dimmer and dimmer it suddenly touched a deep did the slant of the i was remembering the shrill sounds of a bronx playground where years ago beside the grand concourse i had played on long spring evenings such as this,roth
3777,3778,it was a pleasant memory for a young man so far from peace and home and it brought so many recollections with it that i began to grow exceedingly tender about myself,in fact i indulged myself in a reverie so strong that i felt as though a hand were reaching down inside me,roth
3779,3780,it had to reach so very far to touch me,it had to reach past those days in the forests of belgium and past the dying i d refused to weep over past the nights in german farmhouses whose books we d burned to warm us past endless stretches when i had shut off all softness i might feel for my fellows and had managed even to deny myself the posture of a swagger that i as a jew might well have worn as my boots whacked against the rubble of wesel minister and braunschweig,roth
3781,3782,but now one night noise one rumor of home and time past and memory plunged down through all i had anesthetized and came to what i suddenly remembered was myself,so it was not altogether curious that in search of more of me i found myself following grossbart s tracks to chapel no,roth
3783,3784,where the jewish services were being held,i took a seat in the last row which was empty,roth
3785,3786,two rows in front of me sat grossbart fishbein and halpern holding little white dixie cups,each row of seats was raised higher than the one in front of it and i could see clearly what was going on,roth
3787,3788,fishbein was pouring the contents of his cup into grossbart s and grossbart looked mirthful as the liquid made a purple arc between fishbeins hand and his,in the glaring yellow light i saw the chaplain standing on the platform at the front he was chanting the first line of the responsive reading,roth
3789,3790,grossbart s prayer book remained closed on his lap he was swishing the cup around,only halpern responded to the chant by praying,roth
3791,3792,the fingers of his right hand were spread wide across the cover of his open book,his cap was pulled down low onto his brow which made it round like a yarmulke,roth
3793,3794,from time to time grossbart wet his lips at the cup s edge fishbein his lone yellow face a dying light bulb looked from here to there craning forward to catch sight of the faces down the row then of those in front of him then behind,he saw me and his eyelids beat a tattoo,roth
3795,3796,his elbow slid into grossbart s side his neck inclined toward his friend he whispered something and then when the congregation next responded to the chant grossbart s voice was among the others,fishbein looked into his book now too his lips however didn t move,roth
3797,3798,finally it was time to drink the wine,the chaplain smiled down at them as grossbart swigged his in one long gulp halpern sipped meditating and fishbein faked devotion with an empty cup,roth
3799,3800,as i look down amongst the congregation chaplain grinned at the this night i see many new faces and i want to welcome you to fridaynight services here at camp crowder,i am major leo ben ezra your chaplain though an american the chaplain spoke by syllable though to communicate above all with the lip readers in his audience,roth
3801,3802,i have only a few words to say before we adjourn to the refreshment room where the kind ladies of the temple sinai st,after another momentary grin the chaplain raised his hands palms out his eyes flicking upward a moment as if to remind the troops where they were and who else might be in attendance,roth
3803,3804,in the sudden silence that followed i thought i heard grossbart cackle let the goyim clean the floors were those the words,i wasn t sure but fishbein grinning nudged halpern,roth
3805,3806,halpern looked dumbly at him then went back to his prayer book which had been occupying him all through the rabbi s talk,one hand tugged at the black kinky hair that stuck out under his cap,roth
3807,3808,his lips moved,the rabbi continued,roth
3809,3810,it is about the food that i want to speak to you for a moment,i know i know i know he intoned wearily how in the mouths of most of you the trafe food tastes like ashes,roth
3811,3812,i know how you gag some of you and how your parents suffer to think of their children eating foods unclean and offensive to the palate,what can i tell you,roth
3813,3814,i can only say close your eyes and swallow as best you can,eat what you must to live and throw away the rest,roth
3815,3816,i wish i could help more,for those of you who find this impossible may i ask that you try and try but then come to see me in private,roth
3817,3818,then everyone sang ain kelohainu after all those years i discovered i still knew the words,then suddenly the service over grossbart was upon me,roth
3819,3820,higher up,i m making an appointment to see him in private,roth
3821,3822,yesterday he threw up,from the hash,roth
3823,3824,he pushed his yarmulke back into a cap,what about you fishbein i asked,roth
3825,3826,a little,but i ll let it ride,roth
3827,3828,i have a very strong stomach and i don t eat a lot anyway i continued to look at him and he held up his wrist to reinforce what he d just said his watch strap was tightened to the last hole and he pointed that out to me,but services are important to you i asked him,roth
3829,3830,he looked at grossbart,i started to walk toward the door halpern stepped back to make way for me,roth
3831,3832,that s what happened in germany grossbart was saying loud enough for me to hear,they didn t stick together,roth
3833,3834,look grossbart,grossbart how old are you i asked,roth
3835,3836,the same,eighteen grossbart whispered,roth
3837,3838,but like he can t tie his shoes or brush his teeth himself,don t overdo that i said,roth
3839,3840,i left him standing there,i passed by halpern but he did not look at me,roth
3841,3842,then i was outside but behind i heard grossbart call hey mickey my leben come on back,one morning a week later while i was working at my desk captain barrett shouted for me to come into his office,roth
3843,3844,when i entered he had his helmet liner squashed down so far on his head that i couldn t even see his eyes,he was on the phone and when he spoke to me he cupped one hand over the mouthpiece,roth
3845,3846,his mother called a goddam congressman about the food he uncovered the mouthpiece and slid his helmet up until i could see his bottom eyelashes,yes sir he said into the phone,roth
3847,3848,yes sir,i m still here sir,roth
3849,3850,lightfoot harry s on the phone he said between his teeth,this congressman calls general lyman who calls colonel sousa who calls the major who calls me,roth
3851,3852,they re just dying to stick this thing on me,whatsa matter he shook the phone at me,roth
3853,3854,i don t feed the troops,i altered my approach,roth
3855,3856,i mean jews have a very close family life,a boy goes away from home sometimes the mother is liable to get very upset,roth
3857,3858,i m sure we can straighten it out by just asking him,the home life captain is very you re right it may sometimes get out of hand,roth
3859,3860,he turned back to the phone,sir he said,roth
3861,3862,here tells me jews have a tendency to be pushy,he says he thinks we can settle it right here in the,roth
3863,3864,yes,i will call back sir soon as i can he hung up,roth
3865,3866,we re going for a ride he said,the captain drove and i sat beside him,roth
3867,3868,it was a hot spring day and under my newly starched fatigues i felt as though my armpits were melting down onto my sides and chest,the roads were dry and by the time we reached the firing range my teeth felt gritty with dust though my mouth had been shut the whole trip,roth
3869,3870,the captain slammed the brakes on and told me to get the hell out and find grossbart,i found him on his belly firing wildly at the fivehundredfeet target,roth
3871,3872,waiting their turns behind him were halpern and fishbein,fishbein wearing a pair of steelrimmed gi,roth
3873,3874,glasses i hadn t seen on him before had the appearance of an old peddler who would gladly have sold you his rifle and the cartridges that were slung all over him,i stood back by the ammo boxes waiting for grossbart to finish spraying the distant targets,roth
3875,3876,fishbein straggled back to stand near me,hello sergeant marx he said,roth
3877,3878,how are you i mumbled,fine thank you,roth
3879,3880,sergeant i don t mean to you know ask what i shouldn the boy stopped,he was trying to speak intimately but the noise of the shooting forced him to shout at me,roth
3881,3882,what is it i asked,down the range i saw captain barrett standing up in the jeep scanning the line for me and grossbart,roth
3883,3884,my parents keep asking and asking where we re going fishbein said,everybody says the pacific,roth
3885,3886,i called to him,his eyes blazed and twinkled,roth
3887,3888,i wouldn t shoot you sarge he gave me a smile as wide as a pumpkin and turned the barrel aside,damn you grossbart this is no joke,roth
3889,3890,at the jeep he gave the captain a rifle salute,bart sir,roth
3891,3892,sheldon grossbart,it s a common error grossbart nodded at me i understood he indicated,roth
3893,3894,i looked away just as the mess truck pulled up to the range disgorging a halfdozen kps with rolledup sleeves,the mess sergeant screamed at them while they set up the chowline equipment,roth
3895,3896,grossbart your mama wrote some congressman that we don t feed you right,do you know that the captain said,roth
3897,3898,it was my father sir,excuse me sir,roth
3899,3900,you ve been in the army a month already,i ve never seen grossbart eat sir i said,roth
3901,3902,but you heard the rabbi grossbart said,barrett smiled at me and i resented it,roth
3903,3904,all right grossbart he said,what is it you want,roth
3905,3906,the little piece of paper,only to be allowed to live as a jew,roth
3907,3908,the men had been organized into two long chow lines,at the tail end of one i spotted rather his glasses spotted me,roth
3909,3910,they winked sunlight back at me,halpern stood next to him patting the inside of his collar with a khaki handkerchief,roth
3911,3912,they moved with the line as it began to edge up toward the food,the mess sergeant was still screaming at the kps,roth
3913,3914,for a moment i was actually terrified by the thought that somehow the mess sergeant was going to become involved in grossbart s problem,twelve goddam months in combat all through europe,roth
3915,3916,i admire this man the captain snapped a wrist against my chest,do you hear him peeping about the food,roth
3917,3918,do you,i want an answer grossbart,roth
3919,3920,look grossbart,marx here is a good goddam hero,roth
3921,3922,when you were in high school sergeant marx was killing germans,who does more for the by throwing up over a lousy piece of sausage a piece of firstcut meat or marx by killing those nazi bastards,roth
3923,3924,if i was a jew grossbart i d kiss this man s feet,he s a goddam hero and he eats what we give him,roth
3925,3926,why do you have to cause trouble is what i want to know,sergeant get him out of my way barrett swung himself back into the driver s seat,roth
3927,3928,i m going to see the chaplain the engine roared the jeep spun around in a whirl of dust and the captain was headed back to camp,for a moment grossbart and i stood side by side watching the jeep,roth
3929,3930,then he looked at me and said i don t want to start trouble,he was their son,roth
3931,3932,despite all the talk about his parents it was hard to believe in grossbart as a child an related by blood to anyone mother father or above all to me,this realization led me to another,roth
3933,3934,what does your father do grossbart i asked as we started to walk back toward the chow line,a son in the army he said jokingly,roth
3935,3936,and your mother i asked,he winked,roth
3937,3938,a ballabusta,clean press take the pants in that s the extent of it,roth
3939,3940,he turned toward me and when our eyes met his seemed to jump back to shiver in their sockets,yes he walked on and i kept pace,roth
3941,3942,it s what my father would have written if he had known how,it was his name though,roth
3943,3944,he signed it,he even mailed it,roth
3945,3946,i sent it home,with complete seriousness he thrust his right arm in front of me,roth
3947,3948,blood is blood sergeant he said pinching the blue vein in his wrist,what the hell are you trying to do grossbart i asked,roth
3949,3950,i ve seen you eat,do you know that,roth
3951,3952,we re in training,i was talking for him,roth
3953,3954,he would never write sergeant though i pleaded with him,he ll waste away to nothing if i don t help,roth
3955,3956,that s a good one sergeant he said smiling,but who knows,roth
3957,3958,who can tell,maybe you re the little bit,roth
3959,3960,what mickey says is the messiah is a collective idea,he went to yeshiva mickey for a while,roth
3961,3962,he says together we re the messiah,me a little bit you a little bit,roth
3963,3964,you d like to believe that wouldn t you grossbart,two days later a letter addressed to captain barrett passed over my desk,roth
3965,3966,it had come through the chain of the office of congressman franconi where it had been received to general lyman to colonel sousa to major lamont now to captain barrett,i read it over twice,roth
3967,3968,it was dated may the day barrett had spoken with grossbart on the rifle range,fortunately i was able to speak with sheldon on the phone the other night and i think i ve been able to solve our problem,roth
3969,3970,he is as i mentioned in my last letter a very religious boy and it was only with the greatest difficulty that i could persuade him that the religious thing to god himself would want sheldon to be to suffer the pangs of religious remorse for the good of his country and all mankind,it took some doing congressman but finally he saw the light,roth
3971,3972,in fact what he said and i wrote down the words on a scratch pad so as never to forget what he said was i guess you re right dad,so many millions of my fellowjews gave up their lives to the enemy the least i can do is live for a while minus a bit of my heritage so as to help end this struggle and regain for all the children of god dignity and humanity that congressman would make any father proud,roth
3973,3974,by the way sheldon wanted me to to pass on to name of a soldier who helped him reach this decision sergeant nathan marx,sergeant marx is a combat veteran who is sheldon s first sergeant,roth
3975,3976,this man has helped sheldon over some of the first hurdles he s had to face in the army and is in part responsible for sheldon s changing his mind about the dietary laws,i know sheldon would appreciate any recognition marx could receive,roth
3977,3978,thank you and good luck,i look forward to seeing your name on the next election ballot,roth
3979,3980,the communique informed general lyman that sergeant nathan marx was a credit to the us,army and the jewish people,roth
3981,3982,what was grossbart s motive in recanting,did he feel he d gone too far,roth
3983,3984,was the letter a strategic crafty attempt to strengthen what he considered our alliance,or had he actually changed his mind via an imaginary dialogue between grossbart pere and grossbart fils,roth
3985,3986,i was puzzled but only for a few is only until i realized that whatever his reasons he had actually decided to disappear from my life he was going to allow himself to become just another trainee,i saw him at inspection but he never winked at chow formations but he never flashed me a sign,roth
3987,3988,on sundays with the other trainees he would sit around watching the noncoms softball team for which i pitched but not once did he speak an unnecessary word to me,fishbein and halpern retreated grossbart s command i was sure,roth
3989,3990,apparently he had seen that wisdom lay in turning back before he plunged over into the ugliness of privilege undeserved,our separation allowed me to forgive him our past encounters and finally to admire him for his good sense,roth
3991,3992,meanwhile free of grossbart i grew used to my job and my administrative tasks,i stepped on a scale one day and discovered i had truly become a noncombatant i had gained seven pounds,roth
3993,3994,i found patience to get past the first three pages of a book,i thought about the future more and more and wrote letters to girls i d known before the war,roth
3995,3996,i even got a few answers,i sent away to columbia for a law school catalogue,roth
3997,3998,i continued to follow the war in the pacific but it was not my war,i thought i could see the end and sometimes at night i dreamed that i was walking on the streets of third avenue street where i had lived the three years i attended columbia,roth
3999,4000,i curled myself around these dreams and i began to be happy,and then one sunday when everybody was away and i was alone in the orderly room reading a monthold copy of the sporting news grossbart reappeared,roth
4001,4002,we ve got no training this afternoon,at first it offended me and then the feeling was swallowed by the general uneasiness i felt at the thought that everyone on the post was locked away in a dark movie theater and i was here alone with grossbart,roth
4003,4004,i folded up my paper,sergeant he said i d like to ask a favor,roth
4005,4006,the first one s about these rumors,you ll just have to wait to find out,roth
4007,4008,it s not information grossbart,my know he took a step toward the door and then turned back,roth
4009,4010,oh the other thing,louis and they say they ll give me a whole passover dinner if i can get down there,roth
4011,4012,just the two of us,last night i called my aunt and you should have heard her,roth
4013,4014,she said,i got gefilte fish works just a day sergeant,roth
4015,4016,you he said,ashamed that s what you are he said,roth
4017,4018,so you take it out on the rest of us,they say hitler himself was half a jew,roth
4019,4020,what are you after,is this just a weekend pass i m asking for,roth
4021,4022,it suddenly occurred to me that passover had been celebrated weeks before,i said so,roth
4023,4024,that s right he replied,who says no,roth
4025,4026,a month i was in the field eating hash,and now all i ask is a simple favor,roth
4027,4028,a jewish boy i thought would understand,my aunt s willing to go out of her make a seder a month he turned to go mumbling,roth
4029,4030,come back here i called,he stopped and looked at me,roth
4031,4032,grossbart why can t you be like the rest,i am different,roth
4033,4034,better maybe not,i can t stop being me that s all there is to it tears came to his eyes,roth
4035,4036,it s a hard thing to be a jew,but now i understand what mickey s a harder thing to stay one he raised a hand sadly toward me,roth
4037,4038,you stop sergeant,stop closing your heart to your own and wiping his face with his sleeve he ran out the door,roth
4039,4040,he wore a pair of starched khakis and carried a little leather ditty bag,i went out into the heat of the day,roth
4041,4042,it was quiet not a soul was in sight except over by the mess hall four kps sitting around a pan sloped forward from their waists gabbing and peeling potatoes in the sun,grossbart i called,roth
4043,4044,he looked toward me and continued walking,finally he stood before me,roth
4045,4046,where are you going i asked,st,roth
4047,4048,louis,i let him go only a step or two,roth
4049,4050,come back here i said and he followed me into the office where i typed out a pass and signed the captain s name and my own initials after it,he took the pass and then a moment later reached out and grabbed my hand,roth
4051,4052,you re right,i won t,roth
4053,4054,with a slice of carrot and a little horseradish,just show your pass at the gate,roth
4055,4056,you re a good jew sergeant,you like to think you have a hard heart but underneath you re a fine decent man,roth
4057,4058,all right grossbart i said,i felt very pleased with myself it was a great relief to stop fighting grossbart and it had cost me nothing,roth
4059,4060,barrett would never find out and if he did i could manage to invent some excuse,for a while i sat at my desk comfortable in my decision,roth
4061,4062,then the screen door flew back and grossbart burst in again,sergeant he said,roth
4063,4064,behind him i saw fishbein and halpern both in starched khakis both carrying ditty bags like grossbart s,sergeant i caught mickey and larry coming out of the movies,roth
4065,4066,but my aunt said i could bring friends,he pulled halpern up by his sleeve,roth
4067,4068,grossbart was shaking his head,you just pushed a little too hard grossbart,roth
4069,4070,i ll give him my aunt s address and a little note,halpern looked at me and so did fishbein,roth
4071,4072,grossbart was at the door pushing it open,mickey bring me a piece of gefilte fish at least he said and then he was outside again,roth
4073,4074,fishbein had now moved to the doorway where he lingered,he stood there for a moment with his mouth slightly open and then he pointed to himself,roth
4075,4076,and me he asked,his utter ridiculousness exhausted me,roth
4077,4078,i slumped down in my seat and felt pulses knocking at the back of my eyes,fishbein i said you understand i m not trying to deny you anything don t you,roth
4079,4080,if it was my army i d serve gefilte fish in the mess hall,i don t want enemies,roth
4081,4082,i m just like want to serve my time and go home,louis,roth
4083,4084,to shelly s aunt,we ll have a regular seder,roth
4085,4086,play hidethematzoh he gave me a broad blacktoothed smile,i saw grossbart again on the other side of the screen,roth
4087,4088,pst he waved a piece of paper,mickey here s the address,roth
4089,4090,he looked at me and i saw the shrug moving up his arms into his shoulders again,i took the cover off my typewriter and made out passes for him and fishbein,roth
4091,4092,go i said,that afternoon in a bar in joplin i drank beer and listened with half an ear to the cardinal game,roth
4093,4094,i tried to look squarely at what i d become involved in and began to wonder if perhaps the struggle with grossbart wasn t as much my fault as his,what was i that i had to muster generous feelings,roth
4095,4096,who was i to have been feeling so grudging so tighthearted,after all i wasn t being asked to move the world,roth
4097,4098,had i a right then or a reason to clamp down on grossbart when that meant clamping down on halpern too,and ugly agreeable soul,roth
4099,4100,out of the many recollections of my childhood that had tumbled over me these past few days i heard my grandmother s voice what are you making a tsimmes it was what she would ask my mother when say i had cut myself while doing something i shouldn t have done and her daughter was busy bawling me out i needed a hug and a kiss and my mother would moralize but my grandmother overrides justice,i should have known it too,roth
4101,4102,who was nathan marx to be such a penny pincher with kindness,surely i thought the messiah he should ever t niggle over nickels and dimes,roth
4103,4104,god willing he ll hug and kiss,the next day while i was playing softball over on the parade ground i decided to ask bob wright who was noncom in charge of classification and assignment where he thought our trainees would be sent when their cycle ended in two weeks,roth
4105,4106,i asked casually between innings and he said they re pushing them all into the pacific,that night i was just sliding into sleep when someone tapped on my door,roth
4107,4108,who is it i asked,for a moment i felt his presence without being able to see him,roth
4109,4110,how was it i asked,he popped into sight in the neardarkness before me,roth
4111,4112,great sergeant then he was sitting on the edge of the bed,i sat up,roth
4113,4114,how about you he asked,we sat silent for a while and a homey feeling invaded my ugly little cubicle the door was locked the cat was out the children were safely in bed,roth
4115,4116,sergeant can i tell you something,not about me,roth
4117,4118,about mickey,sergeant i never felt for anybody like i feel for him,roth
4119,4120,last night i heard mickey in the bed next to me,he was crying so it could have broken your heart,roth
4121,4122,he held my hand wouldn t let it go,he was almost hysterical,roth
4123,4124,he kept saying if he only knew where we were going,even if he knew it was the pacific that would be better than nothing,roth
4125,4126,not that i couldn t believe in the fact of halpern s crying his eyes always seemed redrimmed,but fact or not it became a lie when grossbart uttered it,roth
4127,4128,he was entirely strategic,but came with the force of was i,roth
4129,4130,there are strategies of aggression but there are strategies of retreat as well,and so recognizing that i myself had not been without craft and guile i told him what i knew,roth
4131,4132,i ll tell him,you mean you think you could do something,roth
4133,4134,there s nothing to be done,maybe the war ll end before you go,roth
4135,4136,i could see him clearly now his jaw had dropped and he looked like a dazed prizefighter,i noticed for the first time a little paper bag in his hand,roth
4137,4138,grossbart i smiled,all of us he handed me the bag,roth
4139,4140,i opened it sure that grossbart was joking,we thought you d probably like it,roth
4141,4142,you egg roll,i just reread the letter,roth
4143,4144,grossbart i said,but i was not calling to him,roth
4145,4146,how can you do this to people i went on,sergeant the day away did us all a world of good,roth
4147,4148,i didn t sidestep,grossbart you re a liar i said,roth
4149,4150,you re a schemer and a crook,you ve got no respect for anything,roth
4151,4152,nothing at all,not for me for the even for poor halpern,roth
4153,4154,honest to god i do,i love mickey,roth
4155,4156,you feel i lurched toward him and grabbed his shirt front,i shook him furiously,roth
4157,4158,grossbart get out,get out and stay the hell away from me,roth
4159,4160,because if i see you i ll make your life miserable,i couldn t stop the fury,roth
4161,4162,it engulfed me owned me till it seemed i could only rid myself of it with tears or an act of violence,i snatched from the bed the bag grossbart had given me and with all my strength threw it out the window,roth
4163,4164,and the next morning as the men policed the area around the barracks i heard a great cry go up from one of the trainees who had been anticipating only his morning handful of cigarette butts and candy wrappers,egg roll he shouted,roth
4165,4166,every single trainee was to be shipped to camp stoneman california and from there to the trainee but one,private sheldon grossbart,roth
4167,4168,he was to be sent to fort monmouth new jersey,i read the mimeographed sheet several times,roth
4169,4170,dee farrell fishbein fuselli fylypowycz glinicki gromke gucwa halpern hardy helebrandt right down to anton were to be headed west before the month was out,all except grossbart,roth
4171,4172,he had pulled a string and i wasn t it,why ohi,roth
4173,4174,who was shulman,and then so simply i knew i d discovered the string that grossbart had pulled,roth
4175,4176,in fact i could hear grossbart the day he d discovered shulman in the px or in the bowling alley or maybe even at services,glad to meet you,roth
4177,4178,where you from,bronx,roth

4189,4190,we got ta help each other you know,how are you nate,roth
4191,4192,bob i wonder if you could do me a favor i heard clearly my own words and they so reminded me of grossbart that i dropped more easily than i could have imagined into what i had planned,this may sound crazy bob but i got a kid here on orders to monmouth who wants them changed,roth
4193,4194,he had a brother killed in europe and he s hot to go to the pacific,says he d feel like a coward if he wound up stateside,roth
4195,4196,i don t know anything be done,anybody,roth
4197,4198,first guy in the alphabet,i don t care,roth
4199,4200,yeah i said,he s a jewish kid so he thought i could help him out,roth
4201,4202,the major hasn t been around here for weeks,temporary duty to the golf course,roth
4203,4204,see you sunday and i hung up perspiring,the following day the corrected orders appeared fishbein fuselli fylypowycz glinicki gromke grossbart gucwa halpern hardy lucky private harley alton was to go to fort monmouth new jersey where for some reason or other they wanted an enlisted man with infantry training,roth
4205,4206,after chow that night i stopped back at the orderly room to straighten out the guardduty roster,grossbart was waiting for me,roth
4207,4208,he spoke first,what do you have against me he cried,roth
4209,4210,against my family,he hasn t had enough troubles in a lifetime you ve got to add to them,roth
4211,4212,i curse the day i ever met you marx,shulman told me what happened over there,roth
4213,4214,there s no limit to your antisemitism is there,the damage you ve done here isn t enough,roth
4215,4216,you have to make a special phone call,i owe nobody nothing i ve done all i could do for them,roth
4217,4218,i heard his furious breathing behind me and it sounded like steam rushing from an engine of terrible strength,you ll be all right i said from the door,roth
4219,4220,and i thought so would fishbein and halpern be all right even in the pacific if only grossbart continued to the obsequiousness of the one the soft spirituality of the profit for himself,i stood outside the orderly room and i heard grossbart weeping behind me,roth
4221,4222,over in the barracks in the lighted windows i could see the boys in their t shirts sitting on their bunks talking about their orders as they d been doing for the past two days,with a kind of quiet nervousness they polished shoes shined belt buckles squared away underwear trying as best they could to accept their fate,roth
4223,4224,behind me grossbart swallowed hard accepting his,and then resisting with all my will an impulse to turn and seek pardon for my vindictiveness i accepted my own,roth
4225,4226,lou epstein lay with his wife in the room with the bed pushed eatercorner,his daughter sheila s bedroom was empty she was at a meeting with her fiance the folk singer,roth
4227,4228,in the comer of her room a childhood teddy bear balanced on its bottom a vote socialist button pinned to its left ear on her bookshelves where volumes of louisa may alcott once gathered dust were now collected the works of howard fast,the house was quiet,roth
4229,4230,the only light burning was downstairs in the dining room where the shabus can dies flickered in their tall golden holders and herbie s jahrzeit candle trembled in its glass,epstein looked at the dark ceiling of his bedroom and let his head that had been bangbanging all day go blank for a moment,roth
4231,4232,his wife goldie breathed thickly beside him as though she suffered from eternal bronchitis,ten minutes before she had undressed and he had watched as she dropped her white nightdress over her head over the breasts which had funneled down to her middle over the behind like a bellows the thighs and calves veined blue like a roadmap,roth
4233,4234,what once could be pinched what once was small and tight now could be poked and pulled,everything hung,roth
4235,4236,he had shut his eyes while she had dressed for sleep and had tried to remember the goldie of the lou epstein of,now he rolled his stomach against her backside remembering and reached around to hold her breasts,roth
4237,4238,the nipples were dragged down like a cow s long as his little finger,he rolled back to his own side,roth
4239,4240,a key turned in the front was whispering then the door gently shut,he tensed and waited for the didn t take those socialists long,roth
4241,4242,at night the noise from the zipping and the unzipping was enough to keep a man awake,what are they doing down there he had screamed at his wife one friday night trying on clothes now once again he waited,roth
4243,4244,it wasn t that he was against their playing,he was no puritan he believed in young people enjoying themselves,roth
4245,4246,hadn t he been a young man himself,but in he and his wife were handsome people,roth
4247,4248,lou epstein had never resembled that chinless lazy smart aleck whose living was earned singing folk songs in a saloon and who once had asked epstein if it hadn t been thrilling to have lived through a period of great social upheava like the thirties,and his daughter why couldn t she have grown up to be the girl across the street whom michael had the date with the one whose father had died,roth
4249,4250,now there was a pretty girl,but not his sheila,roth
4251,4252,what happened he wondered what happened to that little pinkskinned baby,what year what month did those skinny ankles grow thick as logs the peachesandcream turn to pimples,roth
4253,4254,that lovely child was now a twentythreeyearold woman with a social conscience,some conscience he thought,roth
4255,4256,she hunts all day for a picket line to march in so that at night she can come home and eat like a horse for her and that guitar plucker to touch each other s unmentionables seemed worse than was disgusting,when epstein tossed in bed and heard their panting and the zipping it sounded in his ears like thunder,roth
4257,4258,zip,they were at it,roth
4259,4260,he would ignore them think of his other problems,the business here he was a year away from the retirement he had planned but with no heir to epstein paper bag company,roth
4261,4262,he had built the business from the ground suffered and bled during the depression and roosevelt only finally with the war and eisenhower to see it succeed,the thought of a stranger taking it over made him sick,roth
4263,4264,but what could be done,herbie who would have been twentyeight had died of polio age eleven,roth
4265,4266,and sheila his last hope had chosen as her intended a lazy man,what could he do,roth
4267,4268,does a man of fiftynine all of a sudden start producing heirs,zip,roth
4269,4270,pantpantpant,ahh,roth
4271,4272,he shut his ears and mind tighter,he tried to recollect things and drown himself in them,roth
4273,4274,surprised because the boy whom he had not seen for ten or twelve years had grown up with the epstein face as his son would have the small bump in the nose the strong chin dark skin and shock of shiny black hair that one day would turn gray as clouds,look who s here his wife shouted at him the moment he entered the door the day s dirt still under his fingernails,roth
4275,4276,he s been here only three hours already he has a date,the soldier stood at attention square as though he d learned courtesy long before the army,roth
4277,4278,i hope you don t mind my barging in uncle louis,i was shipped to monmouth last week and dad said i should stop off to see you people,roth
4279,4280,i ve got the weekend off and aunt goldie said i should he waited,how is your father epstein had not spoken to his brother sol since when he had bought sol s share of the business and his brother had moved to detroit with words,roth
4281,4282,dad s fine michael said,when sheila came home they all sat down to eat four as in the old days,roth
4283,4284,goldie epstein jumped up and down up and down slipping each course under their noses the instant they had finished the one before,michael she said historically michael as a child you were a very poor eater,roth
4285,4286,your sister ruthie god bless her was a nice eater,he looked at his own daughter and heard his wife go on and on,roth
4287,4288,no ruthie wasn t such a good eater,but she wasn t a picky eater,roth
4289,4290,our herbie he should rest in peace was a picky goldie looked towards her husband as though he would remember precisely what category of eater his beloved son had been he stared into his pot roast,ahhh,roth
4291,4292,the noises snapped epstein s recollection in two,aaahhhh,roth
4293,4294,enough was enough,he got out of bed made certain that he was tucked into his pajamas and started down to the living room,roth
4295,4296,he would give them a piece of his mind,he would tell them was not,roth
4297,4298,no that was what they would tell him,but in the living room it was not sheila and the folk singer,roth
4299,4300,epstein felt the cold from the floor rush up the loose legs of his pajamas and chill his crotch raising goose flesh on his thighs,they did not see him,roth
4301,4302,he retreated a step back behind the archway to the dining room,his eyes however remained fixed on the living room floor on sol s boy and the girl from across the street,roth
4303,4304,the girl had been wearing shorts and a sweater,now they were thrown over the arm of the sofa,roth
4305,4306,the light from the candles was enough for epstein to see that she was naked,michael lay beside her squirming and potent wearing only his army shoes and khaki socks,roth
4307,4308,the girl s breasts were like two small white cups,michael kissed them and more,roth
4309,4310,epstein tingled he did not dare move he did not want to move until the two like cars in a railroad yard slammed fiercely together coupled shook,in their noise epstein tiptoed trembling up the stairs and back to his wife s bed,roth
4311,4312,he could not force himself to sleep for what seemed like hours not until the door had opened downstairs and the two young people had left,now it was sheila and the folk singer,roth
4313,4314,the whole world he thought the whole young world the ugly ones and the pretty ones the fat and the skinny ones zipping and unzippingl he grabbed his great shock of gray hair and pulled it till his scalp hurt,his wife shuffled mumbled a noise,roth
4315,4316,brrr she captured the blankets and pulled them over her,she s dreaming about butter,roth
4317,4318,recipes she dreams while the world zips,he closed his eyes and pounded himself down down into an old man s sleep,roth
4319,4320,later when epstein had more time he would ask himself this question,when did it begin,roth
4321,4322,that night he d seen those two on the floor,or the summer night seventeen years before when he had pushed the doctor away from the bed and put his lips to his herbie s,roth
4323,4324,or epstein wondered was it that night fifteen years ago when instead of smelling a woman between his sheets he smelled babo,or the time when his daughter had first called him capitalist as though it were a dirty name as though it were a crime to be successful,roth
4325,4326,or was it none of these times,maybe to look for a beginning was only to look for an excuse,roth
4327,4328,hadn t the trouble the big trouble begun simply when it appeared to the morning he saw ida kaufman waiting for the bus,and about ida kaufman why in god s name was it a stranger nobody he loved or ever could love who had finally changed his life who had lived across the street for less than a year and who it was revealed by mrs,roth
4329,4330,katz the neighborhood winchell would probably sell her house now that mr,kaufman was dead and move allyearround into their summer cottage at barnegat,roth
4331,4332,until that morning epstein had not more than noticed the woman dark goodlooking a big chest,she hardly spoke to the other housewives but spent every moment until a month ago caring for her cancereaten husband,roth
4333,4334,once or twice epstein had tipped his hat to her but even then he had been more absorbed in the fate of epstein paper bag than in the civility he was practicing,actually then on that monday morning it would not have been unlikely for him to have driven right past the bus stop,roth
4335,4336,it was a warm april day certainly not a bad day to be waiting for a bus,birds fussed and sang in the elm trees and the sun glinted in the sky like a young athlete s trophy,roth
4337,4338,but the woman at the bus stop wore a thin dress and no coat and epstein saw her waiting and beneath the dress the stockings the imagined underthings he saw the body of the girl on his living room rug for ida kaufman was the mother of linda kaufman the girl michael had befriended,so epstein pulled slowly to the curb and stopping for the daughter picked up the mother,roth
4339,4340,thank you mr,epstein she said,roth
4341,4342,ida kaufman rolled down her window and let the breeze waft in she lit a cigarette,yes epstein flushed for reasons ida kaufman did not know,roth
4343,4344,he felt the red on his neck and coughed to make it appear that some respiratory failure had caused the blood to rush up from his heart,he s a very nice boy extremely polite she said,roth
4345,4346,my brother sol s epstein said in detroit and he shifted his thoughts to sol so that the flush might fade if there had been no words with sol it would be michael who would be heir to epstein paper bag,would he have wanted that,roth
4347,4348,was it any better than a,while epstein thought ida kaufman smoked and they drove on without speaking under the elm trees the choir of birds and the new spring sky unfurled like a blue banner,roth
4349,4350,he looks like you she said,what,roth
4351,4352,why,of little boy looks like the iceman she d made that joke,roth
4353,4354,he grinned mostly at the thought of going to bed with his sisterinlaw whose everything had dropped even lower than his wife s,epstein s grin provoked ida kaufman into more extravagant mirth,roth
4355,4356,what the hell he decided he would try a joke himself,had he said the wrong thing,roth
4357,4358,stepped too far,defiled the name of a dead man a man who d had cancer yet,roth
4359,4360,it was so long since he had been with a woman who had a sense of humor his wife took everything he said seriously,not ida kaufman laughed so hard her breasts swelled over the top of her tan dress,roth
4361,4362,they were not cups but pitchers,the next thing epstein knew he was telling her another joke and another in the middle of which a cop screamed up alongside him and gave him a ticket for a red light which in his joy he had not seen,roth
4363,4364,it was the first of three tickets he received that day he earned a second racing down to barnegat later that morning and a third speeding up the parkway at dusk trying not to be too late for dinner,the tickets cost him in all but as he told ida when you re laughing so hard you have tears in your eyes how can you tell the green lights from the red ones fast from slow,roth
4365,4366,at seven o clock that evening he returned ida to the bus stop on the comer and squeezed a bill into her hands,here he said something which brought the day s total to fiftytwo,roth
4367,4368,then he turned up the street already prepared with a story for his wife a man interested in buying epstein paper bag had kept him away all day a good prospect,as he pulled into his driveway he saw his wife s square shape back of the venetian blinds,roth
4369,4370,she ran one hand across a slat checking for dust while she awaited her husband s homecoming,he clutched his pajama trousers around his knees and looked at himself in the bedroom mirror,roth
4371,4372,downstairs a key turned in the lock but he was too engaged to hear it,prickly heat is what herbie always child s complaint,roth
4373,4374,was it possible for a grown man to have it,he shuffled closer to the mirror tripping on his halfhoisted pajamas,roth
4375,4376,maybe it was a sand rash,sure he thought for during those three warm sunny weeks he and ida kaufman when they were through would rest on the beach in front of the cottage,roth
4377,4378,sand must have gotten into his trousers and irritated him on the drive up the parkway,he stepped back now and was squinting at himself in the mirror when goldie walked into the bedroom,roth
4379,4380,she had just emerged from a hot bones ached she had her flesh was boiled red,her entrance startled epstein who had been contemplating his blemish with the intensity of a philosopher,roth
4381,4382,when he turned swiftly from his reflection his feet caught in his pants leg he tripped and the pajamas slipped to the floor,so there they were naked as adam and eve except that goldie was red all over and epstein had prickly heat or a sand rash it came to him as a first principle comes to a metaphysician,roth
4383,4384,of course,his hands shot down to cover his crotch,roth
4385,4386,goldie looked at him mystified while epstein searched for words appropriate to his posture,you ll catch a cold epstein said,roth
4387,4388,you ll catch a cold she looked at the hands laced across his crotch,where she motioned towards his protection,roth
4389,4390,she stepped up closer and reached out her hand not to touch but to point,she drew a little circle of the area with her index finger,roth
4391,4392,it s like a rash on the band or the chest,look i m not a doctor epstein said,roth
4393,4394,it s there today maybe tomorrow it ll be gone,how do i know,roth
4395,4396,i probably got it from the toilet seat at the shop,who said liar and she gave her own form a swift lookingover checked limbs stomach breasts to see if she had perhaps caught the rash from him,roth
4397,4398,she looked back at her husband then at her own body again and suddenly her eyes widened,you she screamed,roth
4399,4400,pig wheeling her way back to the bed she bopped onto it so hard the springs squeaked,liar and then she was off the bed pulling the sheets from it,roth
4401,4402,what are you s not catching,only on the toilet seat,roth
4403,4404,leave it he ran to the back of the bed but as he tucked there goldie raced around and ripped up what he had tucked in the front so he raced back to the front while goldie raced around to the back,don t touch me she screamed don t come near me you filthy pig,roth
4405,4406,go touch some filthy whore then she yanked the sheets off again in one swoop held them in a ball before her and spat,epstein grabbed them back and the tugofwar began back and forth back and forth until they had torn them to shreds,roth
4407,4408,then for the first time goldie cried,with white strips looped over her arms she began to sob,roth
4409,4410,my sheets my nice clean and she threw herself on the bed,two faces appeared in the doorway of the bedroom,roth
4411,4412,sheila epstein groaned holy christ the folk singer peeped in once twice and then bobbed out his feet scuttling down the stairs,epstein whipped some white strands about him to cover his privates,roth
4413,4414,he did not say a word as his daughter entered,that s right epstein said a rash,roth
4415,4416,that s a crime,get out of here,roth
4417,4418,i m a mind reader,respect your father he pulled the white strips tighter around him,roth
4419,4420,instead he threw back his head and addressed the ceiling,she s picketing my bedroom,roth
4421,4422,get out you lummox he took a step towards her and growled as though to scare away a stray cat or dog,with all her one hundred and sixty pounds she pushed her father back in his surprise and hurt he dropped the sheet,roth
4423,4424,and the daughter looked on the father,under her lipstick she turned white,roth
4425,4426,epstein looked up at her,he pleaded i got it from the toilet seat,roth
4427,4428,i heard the noise is and he saw his aunt naked on the bed,when he turned his eyes away there was uncle lou,roth
4429,4430,all of you epstein shouted,sheila blocked the door politically committed michael s legs were rooted one with shame the other curiosity,roth
4431,4432,sheila should i call and then the guitar plucker appeared in the doorway eager bignosed,he surveyed the scene and his gaze at last landed on epstein s crotch the beak opened,roth
4433,4434,what s he got,goldie epstein stopped crying and raised herself off the bed,roth
4435,4436,the young men in the doorway lowered their eyes,goldie arched her back flopped out her breasts and began to move her lips,roth
4437,4438,i she said,divorce,roth
4439,4440,after the smelling salts epstein was ordered to bed in herbie s room,he tossed and turned in the narrow bed which he was unused to in the twin bed beside him he heard michael breathing,roth
4441,4442,monday he thought monday he would seek help,a lawyer,roth
4443,4444,no first a doctor,surely in a minute a doctor could take a look and tell him what he already ida kaufman was a clean woman,roth
4445,4446,epstein would swear by had smelled her flesh,the doctor would reassure him his blemish resulted simply from their rubbing together,roth
4447,4448,it was a temporary thing produced by two not transmitted by one,he was innocent,roth
4449,4450,unless what made him guilty had nothing to do with some dirty bug,but either way the doctor would prescribe for him,roth
4451,4452,and then the lawyer would prescribe,and by then everyone would know including he suddenly realized his brother sol who would take special pleasure in thinking the worst,roth
4453,4454,epstein rolled over and looked to michael s bed pinpoints of light gleamed in the bov s head he was awake and wearing the epstein nose chin and brow,the business had never been for him but for them,roth
4455,4456,and there was no more them,he put his hands over his eyes,roth
4457,4458,the change the change he said,i don t even know when it began,roth
4459,4460,me lou epstein with a rash,i don t even feel any more like lou epstein,roth
4461,4462,all of a sudden pffft,and things are changed he looked at michael again speaking slowly now stressing every word as though the boy were more than a nephew more in fact than a single person,roth
4463,4464,all my life i tried,he flipped on the bedside light and started again a new way,roth
4465,4466,i was seven years old michael,i came here i was a boy seven years old and that day i can remember it like it was yesterday,roth
4467,4468,your grandparents and father wasn t born yet this stuff believe me he doesn t know,with your grandparents i stood on the dock waiting for charlie goldstein to pick us up,roth
4469,4470,he was your grandfather s partner in the old country the thief,anyway we waited and finally he came to pick us up to take us where we would live,roth
4471,4472,and when he came he had a big can in his hand,and you know what was in it,roth
4473,4474,kerosene,we stood there and charlie goldstein poured it on all our heads,roth
4475,4476,he rubbed it in to delouse us,it tasted awful,roth
4477,4478,eh,how can you understand epstein grumbled,roth
4479,4480,what do you know,twentytwo he said softly,roth
4481,4482,there were more stories epstein could tell but he wondered if any of them would bring him closer to what it was he had on his mind but could not find the words for,he got out of bed and walked to the bedroom door,roth
4483,4484,he opened it and stood there listening,on the downstairs sofa he could hear the folk singer snoring,roth
4485,4486,some night for guests,he shut the door and came back into the room scratching his thigh,roth
4487,4488,believe me she s not losing any sleep she doesn t deserve me,what she cooks,roth
4489,4490,that s a big deal,she cleans,roth
4491,4492,that deserves a medal,one day i should come home and the house should be a mess,roth
4493,4494,i should be able to write my initials in the dust somewhere in the basement at least,michael after all these years that would be a pleasure he grabbed at his gray hair,roth
4495,4496,how did this happen,my goldie that such a woman should become a cleaning machine,roth
4497,4498,impossible he walked to the far wall and stared into herbie s baseball pictures the long jawmuscled faces faded technicolor now with signatures at the bottom charlie keller lou gehrig red ruffing a long time,how herbie had loved his yankees,roth
4499,4500,one night epstein started again it was before the depression even you know what we did goldie and me he was staring at red ruffing now through him,you didn t know my goldie what a beautiful beautiful woman she was,roth
4501,4502,and that night we took pictures photos,i set up the was in the old we took pictures in the bedroom he stopped remembered,roth
4503,4504,i wanted a picture of my wife naked to carry with me,i admit it,roth
4505,4506,the next morning i woke up and there was goldie tearing up the negatives,she said god forbid i should get in an accident one day and the police would take out my wallet for identification and then oyoyoy he smiled,roth
4507,4508,you know a woman she worries but at least we took the pictures even if we didn t develop them,how many people even do that he wondered and then turned away from red ruffing to michael who was faintly at at the comers of his mouth smiling,roth
4509,4510,huh epstein smiled,what you never had that kind of idea,roth
4511,4512,i admit it,somebody s got to say,roth
4513,4514,no,some things aren t right,roth
4515,4516,suddenly he was shouting,right wrong,roth
4517,4518,from you and your father that s all i ever hear,who are you what are you king solomon he gripped the bedposts,roth
4519,4520,should i tell you what else happened the night we took pictures,that my herbie was started that night i m sure of it,roth
4521,4522,over a year we tried and tried till i was oysgamitched and that was the night,after the pictures because of the pictures,roth
4523,4524,but this he was pointing at his crotch,you re a boy you don t understand,roth
4525,4526,when they start taking things away from you you reach out you like a pig even but you grab,and right wrong who knows,roth
4527,4528,with tears in your eyes who can even see the difference his voice dropped now but in a minor key the scolding grew more fierce,don t call me names,roth
4529,4530,i didn t see you with ida s girl there s not a name for that,to have a wife to be a father twice a then they start taking things and he fell weakkneed across michael s bed,roth
4531,4532,michael leaned back and looked at his uncle but he did not know what to do or how to chastise for he had never seen anybody over fifteen years old cry before,when the lox was on the table the bagels in the oven the rotogravure section of the news two inches from goldie s nose then sheila would descend the stairs yawning in her toelength housecoat,roth
4533,4534,they would sit down to eat sheila cursing her father for buying the news and putting money in a fascist s pocket outside the gentiles would be walking to church,it had always been the same except of course that over the years the news had come closer to goldie s nose and further from sheila s heart she had the post delivered,roth
4535,4536,this sunday when he awoke epstein smelled coffee bubbling in the kitchen,when he sneaked down the stairs past the had been ordered to use the basement bathroom until he d seen a could smell lox,roth
4537,4538,and at last when he entered the kitchen shaved and dressed he heard newspapers rattling,it was as if another epstein his ghost had risen an hour earlier and performed his sunday duties,roth
4539,4540,beneath the clock around the table sat sheila the folk singer and goldie,sheila you went out for this he gestured towards the paper and the lox,roth
4541,4542,shut up sheila told him,he echoed her words plunk,roth
4543,4544,plunk,thank you then young man epstein said,roth
4545,4546,did you tell her that he shouted at his daughter,nobody answered a conspiracy,roth
4547,4548,he grabbed his daughter by the shoulders,goldie goldie look at me,roth
4549,4550,goldie he said goldie i did the worst thing in the world,look me in the eyes goldie,roth
4551,4552,tell me since when do jewish people get a divorce,syphilis makes soft brains,roth
4553,4554,a grownup child can take care of herself goldie said,if she wants she can come to florida with me,roth
4555,4556,michael left early this morning,what did you say sheila demanded,roth
4557,4558,barnegat and he decided to leave the house before any further questions were asked,at the comer luncheonette he bought his own paper and sat alone drinking coffee and looking out the window beyond which the people walked to church,roth
4559,4560,a pretty young shiksa walked by holding her white round hat in her hand she bent over to remove her shoe and shake a pebble from it,epstein watched her bend and he spilled some coffee on his shirt front,roth
4561,4562,the girl s small behind was round as an apple beneath the closefitting dress,he looked and then as though he were praying he struck himself on the chest with his fist again and again,roth
4563,4564,what have i done,to home,roth
4565,4566,what home,across the street in her backyard he saw ida kaufman who was wearing shorts and a halter and was hanging her daughter s underwear on the clothesline,roth
4567,4568,epstein looked around and saw only the gentiles walking to church,ida saw him and smiled,roth
4569,4570,growing angry he stepped off the curb and passionately began to jaywalk,at noon in the epstein house those present heard a siren go off,roth
4571,4572,sheila looked up from the post and listened she looked at her watch,noon,roth
4573,4574,i m fifteen minutes slow,she looked at her watch,roth
4575,4576,i m fourteen minutes slow,quiet sheila said,roth
4577,4578,she cocked her ear,but it s sunday,roth
4579,4580,it s a real air raid,goldie trailed behind her feet slapping against her slippers,roth
4581,4582,on the street she suddenly turned back to the house to make sure the door was shut against daytime burglars bugs and dust,when she turned again she had not far to run,roth
4583,4584,the ambulance had pulled up across the street in kaufman s driveway,already a crowd had gathered neighbors in bathrobes housecoats carrying the comic sections with them and too churchgoers shiksas in white hats,roth
4585,4586,goldie could not make her way to the front where her daughter and marvin stood but even from the rear of the crowd she could see a young doctor leap from the ambulance and race up to the porch his stethoscope wiggling in his back pocket as he took two steps at a time,mrs,roth
4587,4588,katz arrived,a squat redfaced woman whose stomach seemed to start at her knees she tugged at goldie s arm,roth
4589,4590,all that racket,she surveyed the crowd then looked at the house,roth
4591,4592,poor woman she said remembering that only three months before on a windy march morning an ambulance had arrived to take mrs,kaufman s husband to the nursing home from which he never returned,roth
4593,4594,troubles mrs,katz was shaking her head a pot of sympathy,roth
4595,4596,everybody has their little bundle believe me,i ll bet she had a nervous breakdown,roth
4597,4598,that s not a good thing,gallstones you have them out and they re out,roth
4599,4600,katz saw that no one had emerged from the house yet she had time to gather a little information,he s who goldie,roth
4601,4602,the son of the brotherinlaw that lou doesn t talk to,a voice at the front of the crowd was commanding,roth
4603,4604,a little room here,please,roth
4605,4606,a little room damn it it was sheila,a little room,roth
4607,4608,behind them stood mrs,kaufman a man s white shirt tucked into her shorts,roth
4609,4610,her eyes peered out of two red holes she wore no makeup mrs,katz noted,roth
4611,4612,it must be the girl said pearl katz up on her toes,mrs,roth
4613,4614,katz jumped up and down,i can she pushed up on her toes out of her slippers,roth
4615,4616,god,my god and she was racing forward screaming lou,roth
4617,4618,the stretcher was sliding into the ambulance now,sheila let me go it s your father she pointed to the ambulance whose red eye spun slowly on top,roth
4619,4620,for a moment goldie looked back to the steps,ida kaufman stood there yet her fingers fidgeting at the buttons of the shirt,roth
4621,4622,then goldie broke for the ambulance her daughter beside her propelling her by her elbows,who are you the doctor said,roth
4623,4624,he took a step towards them to stop their forward motion for it seemed as if they intended to dive right into the ambulance on top of his patient,the sheila shouted,roth
4625,4626,the doctor pointed to the porch,the doctor pushed sheila aside climbed in and then the ambulance was moving the siren screaming,roth
4627,4628,sheila ran after the ambulance a moment hammering on the door but then she turned the other way and was headed back through the crowd and up the stairs to ida kaufman s house,goldie turned to the doctor,roth
4629,4630,he ll be all right the doctor said,but a heart attack,roth
4631,4632,the ambulance zoomed through a red light and made a sharp right turn that threw goldie to the floor,she sat there and spoke,roth
4633,4634,he s awake now the doctor said,lou you re all right,roth
4635,4636,epstein blinked his eyes,he knows the doctor said,roth
4637,4638,he ll be all right,his tongue hung over his teeth like a dead snake,roth
4639,4640,don t you talk his wife said,don t you worry about anything,roth
4641,4642,not even the business,that ll work out,roth
4643,4644,our sheila will marry marvin and that ll be that,you won t have to sell lou it ll be in the family,roth
4645,4646,you can retire rest and marvin can take over,don t try to talk,roth
4647,4648,i ll take care,you ll be better soon and we can go someplace,roth
4649,4650,we can go to saratoga to the mineral baths if you want,we ll just go you and suddenly she gripped his hand,roth
4651,4652,lou you ll live normal won t you,won t you she was crying,roth
4653,4654,cause what ll happen lou is you ll kill yourself,i don t know why i m crying goldie wiped her eyes,roth
4655,4656,he ll be all right,you say so i believe you you re a doctor and as the young man swung open the door with the big red cross painted on the back she asked softly doctor you have something that will cure what else he s rash she pointed,roth
4657,4658,the doctor looked at her,then he lifted for a moment the blanket that covered epstein s nakedness,roth
4659,4660,an irritation the doctor said,she grabbed his wrist,roth
4661,4662,the first week my new classmates and i were given a battery of tests designed to reveal our skills deficiencies tendencies and psyches,at the end of the week mr,roth
4663,4664,russo the occupations teacher would add the skills subtract the deficiencies and tell us what jobs best suited our talents it was all mysterious but scientific,i remember we first took a preference test which would you prefer to do this that or the other albie pelagutti sat one seat behind me and to my left and while this first day of high school i strolled happily through the test examining ancient fossils here defending criminals there albie like the inside of vesuvius rose fell pitched tossed and swelled in his chair,roth
4665,4666,when he finally made a decision he made it,you could hear his pencil drive the x into the column opposite the activity in which he thought it wisest to prefer to engage,roth
4667,4668,russo left the room,i m going for a drink he said,roth
4669,4670,russo was forever at pains to let us know what a squareshooter he was and that unlike other teachers we might have had he would not go out the front door of the classroom to sneak around to the back door and observe how responsible we were,and sure enough when he returned after going for a drink his lips were wet when he came back from the men s room you could smell the soap on his hands,roth
4671,4672,take your time boys he said and the door swung shut behind him,his black wingtipped shoes beat down the marble corridor and five thick fingers dug into my shoulder,roth
4673,4674,i turned around it was pelagutti,what i said,roth
4675,4676,number twentysix pelagutti said what s the answer i gave him the truth anything pelagutti rose halfway over his desk and glared at me,he was a hippopotamus big black and smelly his short sleeves squeezed tight around his monstrous arms as though they were taking his own blood at that moment was skybound what s the answer menaced i flipped back three pages in my question booklet and reread number twentysix,roth
4677,4678,which would you prefer to do attend a world trade convention,pick cherries,roth
4679,4680,stay with and read to a sick friend,tinker with automobile engines i looked blankfaced back to albie and shrugged my shoulders,roth
4681,4682,it doesn t s no right answer,anything he almost rocketed out of his seat,roth
4683,4684,don t give me that crap,what s the answer strange heads popped up all over the glances hissing lips shaming i realized that any minute russo wetlipped might come back and my first day in high school i would be caught cheating,roth
4685,4686,i looked again at number twentysix then back to albie and then i always was towards anger pity fear love vengeance and an instinct for irony that was at the time delicate as a mallet i whispered stay and read to a sick friend the volcano subsided and albie and i had met,we became friends,roth
4687,4688,he remained at my elbow throughout the testing then throughout lunch then after school,i learned that albie as a youth had done all the things i under direction had not he had eaten hamburgers in strange diners he had gone out after cold showers wethaired into winter weather he had been cruel to animals he had trafficked with whores he had stolen he had been caught and he had paid,roth
4689,4690,but now he told me as i unwrapped my lunch in the candy store across from school now i m through crappin around,i m gettin an education,roth
4691,4692,i m gon na and i think he picked up the figure from a movie musical he had seen the previous afternoon while the rest of us were in english i m gon na put my best foot forward the following week when russo read the results of the testing it appeared that albie s feet were not only moving forward but finding strange wonderful paths,russo sat at his desk piles of tests stacked before him like ammunition charts and diagrams mounted huge on either side and delivered our destinies,roth
4693,4694,albie and i were going to be lawyers,of all that albie confessed to me that first week one fact in particular fastened on my brain i soon forgot the town in sicily where he was born the occupation of his father he either made ice or delivered it the year and model of the cars he had stolen,roth
4695,4696,i did not forget though that albie had apparently been the star of the jamesburg reformatory baseball team,when i was selected by the gym teacher mr,roth
4697,4698,hopper to captain one of my gym class s softball teams we played softball until the world series was over then switched to touch football i knew that i had to get pelagutti on my side,with those arms he could hit the ball a mile,roth
4699,4700,the day teams were to be selected albie shuffled back and forth at my side while in the lockerroom i changed into my gym khakicolored shorts tshirt sweat socks and sneakers,albie had already changed beneath his khaki gym shorts he did not wear a support but retained his lavender undershorts they hung down three inches below the outer shorts and looked like a long fancy hem,roth
4701,4702,instead of a tshirt he wore a sleeveless undershirt and beneath his high tarblack sneakers he wore thin black silk socks with slender arrows embroidered up the sides,naked he might like some centuriesdead ancestor have tossed lions to their death in the colosseum the outfit though i didn t tell him detracted from his dignity,roth
4703,4704,as we left the lockerroom and padded through the dark basement corridor and up onto the sunny september playing field he talked continually i didn t play sports when i was a kid but i played at jamesburg and baseball came to me like nothing i nodded my head,what you think of pete reiser he asked,roth
4705,4706,he s a pretty good man i said,hopper bronzed smiling erect was flipping a coin i looked up saw the glint in the sun and i was calling heads it landed tails and the other captain had first choice,roth
4707,4708,my heart flopped over when he looked at albie s arms but calmed when he passed on and chose first a tall lean firstbaseman type,immediately i said i ll take pelagutti you don t very often see smiles like the one that crossed albie pelagutti s face that moment you would think i had paroled him from a life sentence,roth
4709,4710,the game began,i played batted second albie was in center field and at his wish batted fourth,roth
4711,4712,their first man grounded out me to the first baseman,the next batter hit a high lofty fly ball to center field,roth
4713,4714,the moment i saw albie move after it i knew tommy henrich and pete reiser were only names to him all he knew about baseball he d boned up on the night before,while the ball hung in the air albie jumped up and down beneath it his arms raised upward directly above his head his wrists were glued together and his two hands flapped open and closed like a butterfly s wings begging the ball toward them,roth
4715,4716,c mon he was screaming to the sky c mon you and his legs bicyclepumped up and down up and down,i hope the moment of my death does not take as long as it did for that damn ball to drop,roth
4717,4718,it hung it hung albie cavorting beneath like a holy roller,and then it landed smack into albie s chest,roth
4719,4720,the runner was rounding second and heading for third while albie twirled all around looking his arms down now stretched out as though he were playing ringaroundarosy with two invisible children,behind you pelagutti i screamed,roth
4721,4722,he stopped moving,what he called back to me,roth
4723,4724,i ran halfway out to center field,behind it and then as the runner rounded third i had to stand there defining relay to him,roth
4725,4726,at the end of the first half of the first inning we came to bat behind home runs all relayed in too late by pelagutti,out of a masochistic delight i must describe albie at tht plate first he faced the pitcher then when he swung at the he did at every was not to the side but down as though he were driving a peg into the ground,roth
4727,4728,don t ask if he was righthanded or lefthanded,i don t know,roth
4729,4730,while we changed out of our gym uniforms i was silent,i boiled as i watched pelagutti from the comer of my eye,roth
4731,4732,he kicked off those crazy black sneakers and pulled his pink gaucho shirt on over his was still a red spot above the u front of the undershirt where the first fly ball had hit him,without removing his gym shorts he stuck his feet into his gray watched as he hoisted the trousers over the red splotches where ground balls had banged off his shins past the red splotches where pitched balls had smacked his knee caps and thighs,roth
4733,4734,finally i spoke,damn you pelagutti you wouldn t know pete reiser if you fell over him he was stuffing his sneakers into his locker he didn t answer,roth
4735,4736,i was talking to his mountainous pink shirt back,where do you come off telling me you played for that prison team he mumbled something,roth
4737,4738,what i said,i did he grumbled,roth
4739,4740,bullshit i said,we did not speak as we left the lockerroom,roth
4741,4742,as we passed the gym office on our way up to occupations mr,hopper looked up from his desk and winked at me,roth
4743,4744,then he motioned his head at pelagutti to indicate that he knew i d picked a lemon but how could i have expected a bum like pelagutti to be an allamerican boy in the first place,then mr,roth
4745,4746,hopper turned his sunlamped head back to his desk,now i said to pelagutti as we turned at the second floor landing now i m stuck with you for the rest of the term he shuffled ahead of me without answering his oxlike behind should have had a tail on it to flick the flies infuriated me,roth
4747,4748,you goddamn liar i said,he spun around as fast as an ox can,roth
4749,4750,you ain t stuck with nobody we were at the top of the landing headed into the lockerlined corridor the kids who were piling up the stairs behind stopped listened,no you ain t you snotass and i saw five hairy knuckles coming right at my mouth,roth
4751,4752,i moved but not in time and heard a crash inside the bridge of my nose,i felt my hips dip back my legs and head come forward and curved like the letter c i was swept fifteen feet backward before i felt cold marble beneath the palms of my hands,roth
4753,4754,albie stepped around me and into the occupations room,just then i looked up to see mr,roth
4755,4756,russo s black wingtipped shoes enter the room,i m almost sure he had seen albie blast me but i ll never know,roth
4757,4758,nobody including albie and myself ever mentioned it again,perhaps it had been a mistake for me to call albie a liar but if he had starred at baseball it was in some league i did not know,roth
4759,4760,by way of contrast i want to introduce duke scarpa another excon who was with us that year,neither albie nor the duke incidentally was a typical member of my high school community,roth
4761,4762,both lived at the other end of newark down neck and they had reached us only after the board of education had tried albie at two other schools and the duke at four,the board hoped finally like marx that the higher culture would absorb the lower,roth
4763,4764,albie and duke had no particular use for each other where albie had made up his mind to go straight one always felt that the duke in his oily quietness his boneless grace was planning a job,yet though affection never lived between them duke wandered after albie and me aware i suspect that if albie despised him it was because he was able to read his that such an associate was easier to abide than one who despises you because he does not know your soul at all,roth
4765,4766,where albie was a hippopotamus an ox duke was reptilian,me,roth
4767,4768,i don t know it is easy to spot the animal in one s fellows,during lunch hour the duke and i used to spar with each other in the hall outside the cafeteria,roth
4769,4770,he did not know a hook from a jab and disliked having his dark skin roughened or his hair mussed but he so delighted in moving bobbing coiling and uncoiling that i think he would have paid for the privilege of playing the serpent with me,he hypnotized me the duke he pulled some slimy string inside albie pelagutti sought and stretched a deeper and i think a nobler cord,roth
4771,4772,but i make albie sound like peachesandcream,let me tell you what he and i did to mr,roth
4773,4774,russo,russo believed in his battery of tests as his immigrant parents and albie s and maybe albie himself believed in papal infallibility,roth
4775,4776,if the tests said albie was going to be a lawyer then he was going to be a lawyer,as for albie s past it seemed only to increase russo s devotion to the prophecy he approached albie with salvation in his eyes,roth
4777,4778,i called to him but he shouted back that he had seen it all before and then he was not walking but running towards the crowded downtown streets pursued not by police but by other days,it wasn t that he considered russo an ass for having sent him to visit the court respected teachers too much for that rather i think he felt russo had tried to rub his nose in it,roth
4779,4780,no surprise then when the next day after gym albie announced his assault on the occupations teacher it was the first crime he had planned since his decision to go straight back in september,he outlined the action to me and indicated that i should pass the details on to the other members of the class,roth
4781,4782,as liaison between albie and the wellbehaved healthy nonconvicts like myself who made up the rest of the class i was stationed at the classroom door and as each member passed in i unfolded the plot into his ear as soon after tenfifteen as russo turns to the blackboard you bend over to tie your shoelace if a classmate looked back at me puzzled i would motion to pelagutti hulking over his desk the puzzled expression would vanish and another accomplice would enter the room,the only one who gave me any trouble was the duke,roth
4783,4784,he listened to the plan and then scowled back at me with the look of a man who s got his own syndicate and in fact has never even heard of yours,finally the bell rang i closed the door behind me and moved noiselessly to my desk,roth
4785,4786,i waited for the clock to move to a quarter after it did and then russo turned to the board to write upon it the salary range of aluminum workers,i bent to tie my all the desks i saw other upsidedown grinning faces,roth
4787,4788,to my left behind me i heard albie hissing his hands fumbled about his black silk socks and the hiss grew and grew until it was a rush of sicilian muttered spewed vicious,the exchange was strictly between russo and himself,roth
4789,4790,i looked to the front of the classroom my fingers knotting and unknotting my shoelaces the blood pumping now to my face,i saw russo s legs turn,roth
4791,4792,what a sight he must have there had been twentyfive faces now there was nothing,just desks,roth
4793,4794,okay i heard russo say okay and then he gave a little clap with his hands,that s enough now fellas,roth
4795,4796,the joke is over,what a noise,roth
4797,4798,mr,russo stood motionless at the front of the class listening astonished,roth
4799,4800,he wore a neatly pressed dark blue pinstriped suit a tan tie with a collie s head in the center and a tieclasp with the initials rr,engraved upon it he had on the black wingtipped shoes they glittered,roth
4801,4802,russo who believed in neatness honesty punctuality planned believed in the future in occupations,and next to me behind me inside me all over,roth
4803,4804,we looked at each other albie and i and my lungs split with joy don t sit under the apple albie s monotone boomed out and then a thick liquid crooner s voice behind albie bathed me in sound it was the duke s he clapped to a tango beat,russo leaned for a moment against a visual aids skilled laborers salaries and requirements then scraped back his chair and plunged down into it so far down it looked to have no bottom,roth
4805,4806,he lowered his big head to the desk and his shoulders curled forward like the ends of wet paper and that was when albie pulled his coup,he stopped singing don t sit under the apple tree we all stopped,roth
4807,4808,russo looked up at the silence his eyes black and baggy he stared at our leader alberto pelagutti,slowly russo began to shake his head from side to side this was no capone this was a garibaldi,roth
4809,4810,russo waited i waited we all waited,albie slowly rose and began to sing oh say can you see by the dawn s early light what so proudly we and we all stood and joined him,roth
4811,4812,tears sparkling on his long black lashes mr,robert russo dragged himself wearily up from his desk beaten and as the pelagutti basso boomed disastrously behind me i saw russo s lips begin to move the bombs bursting in air gave god did we sing,roth
4813,4814,albie left school in june of that had passed only our comradeship that strange vessel was smashed to bits at noon one day a few months earlier,it was a lunch hour in march the duke and i were sparring in the hall outside the cafeteria and albie who had been more hospitable to the duke since the day his warm liquid voice had joined the had decided to act as our referee jumping between us separating our clinches warning us about low blows grabbing out for the duke s droopy crotch in general having a good time,roth
4815,4816,i remember that the duke and i were in a clinch as i showered soft little punches to his kidneys he squirmed in my embrace,the sun shone through the window behind him lighting up his hair like a nest of snakes,roth
4817,4818,i fluttered his sides he twisted i breathed hard through my nose my eves registered on his snaky hair and suddenly albie wedged between and knocked us duke plunged sideways i plunged forward and my fist crashed through the window that scarm had been using as his comer,feet pounded in a second a wisecracking guiltless chewing crowd was gathered around me just me albie and the duke gone,roth
4819,4820,i cursed them both the honorless bastards,the crowd did not drift back to lunch until the head dietitian a huge varicoseveined matron in a laundrystiff white uniform had written down my name and led me to the nurse s office to have the glass picked out of my knuckles,roth
4821,4822,later in the afternoon i was called for the first and only time to the office of mr,wendell the principal,roth
4823,4824,fifteen years have passed since then and i do not know what has happened to albie pelagutti,if he is a gangster he was not one with notoriety or money enough for the kefauver committee to interest itself in several years ago,roth
4825,4826,when the crime committee reached new jersey i followed their investigations carefully but never did i read in the papers the name alberto pelagutti or even duke who can tell what name the duke is known by now,i do know however what happened to the occupations teacher for when another senate committee swooped through the state a while back it was discovered that robert been a marxist while attending montclair state teachers college circa,roth
4827,4828,russo refused to answer some of the committee s questions and the newark board of education met chastised and dismissed him,i read now and then in the newark news that civil liberties union attorneys are still trying to appeal his case and i have even written a letter to the board of education swearing that if anything subversive was ever done to my character it wasn t done by my exhigh school teacher russo if he was a communist i never knew it,roth
4829,4830,i could not decide whether or not to include in the letter a report of the starspangled banner incident who knows what is and is not proof to the crotchety ladies and chainstore owners who sit and die on boards of education,and if to alter an ancient s text a man s history is his fate who knows whether the newark board of education will ever attend to a letter written to them by me,roth
4831,4832,i mean have fifteen years buried that afternoon i was called to see the principal,was a tall distinguished gentleman and as i entered his office he rose and extended his hand,roth
4833,4834,the same sun that an hour earlier had lit up snakes in the duke s hair now slanted through mr,wendell s blinds and warmed his deep green carpet,roth
4835,4836,how do you do he said,yes i answered non sequiturly and ducked my bandaged hand under my unbandaged hand,roth
4837,4838,graciously he said sit down won t you frightened unpracticed i performed an aborted curtsy and sat,i watched mr,roth
4839,4840,wendell go to his metal filing cabinet slide one drawer open and take from it a large white index card,he set the card on his desk and motioned me over so i might read what was typed on the card,roth
4841,4842,at the top in caps was my whole first and middle below the name was a roman numeral one and beside it fighting in corridor broke window already documented,and on a big card with plenty of space,roth
4843,4844,i returned to my chair and sat back as mr,wendell told me that the card would follow me through life,roth
4845,4846,at first i listened but as he talked on and on the drama went out of what he said and my attention wandered to his filing cabinet,i began to imagine the cards inside albie s card and the duke s and then i short of the two of them had zoomed off and left me to pay penance for the window by myself,roth
4847,4848,albie you see had always known about the filing cabinet and these index cards i hadn t and russo poor russo has only recently found out,eli jumped back surprised then they shook hands and tzuref gestured him into the sagging old mansion,roth
4849,4850,at the door eli turned and down the slope of lawn past the jungle of hedges beyond the dark untrampled horse path he saw the street lights blink on in woodenton,the stores along coach house road tossed up a burst of came to eli as a secret signal from his townsmen tell this tzuref where we stand eli,roth
4851,4852,this is a modem community eli we have our families we pay eli burdened by the message gave tzuref a dumb weary stare,you must work a full day tzuref said steering the attorney and his briefcase into the chilly hall,roth
4853,4854,eli s heels made a racket on the cracked marble floor and he spoke above it,it s the commuting that s killing he said and entered the dim room tzuref waved open for him,roth
4855,4856,three hours a day i came right from the train he dwindled down into a harpbacked chair,he expected it would be deeper than it was and consequently jarred himself on the sharp bones of his seat,roth
4857,4858,it woke him this shiver of the behind to his business,tzuref a bald shaggybrowed man who looked as if he d once been very fat sat back of an empty desk halfway hidden as though he were settled on the floor,roth
4859,4860,everything around him was empty,there were no books in the bookshelves no rugs on the floor no draperies in the big casement windows,roth
4861,4862,as eli began to speak tzuref got up and swung a window back on one noisy hinge,may and it s like august he said and with his back to eli he revealed the black circle on the back of his head,roth
4863,4864,the crown of his head was missing,he returned through the lamps had no eli realized all he d seen was a skullcap,roth
4865,4866,tzuref struck a match and lit a candle just as the halfdying shouts of children at play rolled in through the open window,it was as though tzuref had opened it so eli could hear them,roth
4867,4868,aah now he said,instead the old man leaned forward onto his stomach worked his hand into his pants pocket and withdrew what appeared to be a weekold handkerchief,roth
4869,4870,he uncrumpled it he unfolded it he ironed it on the desk with the side of his hand,so he said,roth
4871,4872,eli pointed to the grimy sheet which he d gone over wordbyword with his partners lewis and mcdonnell,i expected an answer eli said,roth
4873,4874,their noise caught up against eli s flesh and he was unable to restrain a shudder,he wished he had gone home showered and eaten dinner before calling on tzuref,roth
4875,4876,he was not feeling as professional as place was too dim it was too late,but down in woodenton they would be waiting his clients and neighbors,roth
4877,4878,he spoke for the jews of woodenton not just himself and his wife,you understood eli said,roth
4879,4880,exactly eli had the urge to rise and walk about the room,and then of course made a pair of scales in the air with his the law is not the law,roth
4881,4882,when is the law that is the law not the law he jiggled the scales,you can t have a boarding school in a residential area he would not allow tzuref to cloud the issue with issues,roth
4883,4884,that s what residential means the dp s english was perhaps not as good as it seemed at first,tzuref spoke slowly but till then eli had mistaken it for even wisdom,roth
4885,4886,residence means home he added,look mr,roth
4887,4888,mr,peck he said i don t believe but he did not seem to be referring to anything eli had said,roth
4889,4890,mr,tzuref that is the law,roth
4891,4892,we stay he smiled,we are tired,roth
4893,4894,the headmaster is tired,it felt so heavy packed with the grievances vengeances and schemes of his clients,roth
4895,4896,there were days when he carried it like a tzuref s office it weighed a ton,goodbye mr,roth
4897,4898,eli opened the door to the office and walked carefully down the dark tomb of a corridor to the door,he stepped out on the porch and leaning against a pillar looked down across the lawn to the children at play,roth
4899,4900,their voices whooped and rose and dropped as they chased each other round the old house,the dusk made the children s game look like a tribal dance,roth
4901,4902,eli straightened up started off the porch and suddenly the dance was ended,a long piercing scream trailed after,roth
4903,4904,it was the first time in his life anyone had ran at the sight of him,keeping his eyes on the lights of woodenton he headed down the path,roth
4905,4906,and then seated on a bench beneath a tree eli saw him,at first it seemed only a deep hollow of the figure emerged,roth
4907,4908,eli recognized him from the description,there he was wearing the hat that hat which was the very cause of eli s mission the source of woodenton s upset,roth
4909,4910,the town s lights flashed their message once again get the one with the hat,perhaps he was less stubborn than tzuref more reasonable,roth
4911,4912,after all it was the law,but when he was close enough to call out he didn t,roth
4913,4914,he was stopped by the sight of the black coat that fell down below the man s knees and the hands which held each other in his lap,by the roundtopped widebrimmed talmudic hat pushed onto the back of his head,roth
4915,4916,and by the beard which hid his neck and was so soft and thin it fluttered away and back again with each heavy breath he took,he was asleep his sidelocks curled loose on his cheeks,roth
4917,4918,his face was no older than eli s,eli hurried towards the lights,roth
4919,4920,the note on the kitchen table unsettled him,scribblings on bits of paper had made history this past week,roth
4921,4922,this one however was unsigned,sweetie it said i went to sleep,roth
4923,4924,i had a sort of oedipal experience with the baby today,he hated cold soggy dinners but would take one gladly in place of miriam s presence,roth
4925,4926,he was ruffled and she never helped that not with her infernal analytic powers,he loved her when life was proceeding that was when she loved him,roth
4927,4928,but sometimes eli found being a lawyer surrounded him like quicks couldn t get his breath,too often he wished he were pleading for the other side though if he were on the other side then he d wish he were on the side he was,roth
4929,4930,the trouble was that sometimes the law didn t seem to be the answer law didn t seem to have anything to do with what was aggravating everybody,and that of course made him feel foolish and unnecessary though that was not the situation townsmen had a case,roth
4931,4932,but not exactly and if miriam were awake to see eli s upset she would set about explaining his distress to him understanding him forgiving him so as to get things back to normal for normal was where they loved one another,the difficulty with miriam s efforts was they only upset him more not only did they explain little to him about himself or his predicament but they convinced him of her weakness,roth
4933,4934,neither eli nor miriam it turned out was terribly strong,halfway through he gave in to himself removed tzuref s notes and put them on the table beside miriam s,roth
4935,4936,from time to time he flipped through the notes which had been carried into town by the one in the black hat,boys shoes,roth
4937,4938,this gentleman has a check already signed,please fill in correct amount,roth
4939,4940,he didn t say a word,eli in woodenton a yeshivah,roth
4941,4942,old man puddington ll roll over in his grave,charge it to our account yeshivah of woodenton we will now open with you and expect a bill each month,roth
4943,4944,the gentleman will be in to see you once or twice a week,do you carry kosher meat,roth
4945,4946,he walked right by my window the greenie ted had said and he nodded eli,don t shout,roth
4947,4948,i m pregnant,the baby is heavy eli found he was getting angry at nothing she d said yet it was what she was going to say,roth
4949,4950,he s a very heavy baby the doctor says miriam told him,then sit down and make my dinner now he found himself angry about her not being present at the dinner which he d just been relieved that she wasn t present at it was as though he had a raw nerve for a tail that he kept stepping on,roth
4951,4952,at last miriam herself stepped on it,eli you re upset,roth
4953,4954,he would grow angry knowing she would be understanding she would in turn grow more understanding seeing his anger,he would in turn grow angrier the phone rang,roth
4955,4956,hello eli said,eli ted,roth
4957,4958,a dp,what subjects ted asked,roth
4959,4960,this is the twentieth century eli,now it s the guy with the hat,roth
4961,4962,in a moment the phone rang,eli,roth
4963,4964,we got cut off,we ve got nothing to worry about,roth
4965,4966,i thought you said nothing worked out it was miriam,the phone rang,roth
4967,4968,eli artie,ted called,roth
4969,4970,you worked it out,i m tired,roth
4971,4972,he laid it lightly for she was that day entering the second week of her ninth month,still when she slept it was a good place to rest to rise and fall with her breathing and figure things out,roth
4973,4974,if that guy would take off that crazy hat,i know it what eats them,roth
4975,4976,eli please baby shouldn t you maybe stop in to see dr,i m telling the kid the truth aren t i miriam,roth
4977,4978,a sling chair three months to go on a new yorker subscription and an introduction to psychoanalysis,what is my liver doing now,roth
4979,4980,what is my small intestine doing now,he removed the tzuref notes and read through them all again,roth
4981,4982,it unnerved him to think of all the flashy reasons his wife could come up with for his reading and rereading the notes,eli why are you so preoccupied with tzuref eli stop getting involved,roth
4983,4984,why do you think you re getting involved eli sooner or later everybody s wife finds their weak spot,his goddam luck he had to be neurotic,roth
4985,4986,why couldn t he have been born with a short leg,he removed the cover from his typewriter hating miriam for the edge she had,roth
4987,4988,all the time he wrote the letter he could hear what she would be saying about his not being able to let the matter drop,well her trouble was that she wasn t able to face the matter,roth
4989,4990,but he could hear her answer already clearly he was guilty of a reaction formation still all the fancy phrases didn t fool eli all she wanted really was for eli to send tzuref and family on their way so that the community s temper would quiet and the calm circumstances of their domestic happiness return,all she wanted were order and love in her private world,roth
4991,4992,was she so wrong,let the world bat its brains woodenton there should be peace,roth
4993,4994,i don t think there s any reason for us not to be able to come up with some sort of compromise that will satisfy the jewish community of woodenton and the yeshivah and yourself,it seems to me that what most disturbs my neighbors are the visits to town by the gentleman in the black hat suit etc,roth
4995,4996,woodenton is a progressive suburban community whose members both jewish and gentile are anxious that their families live in comfort and beauty and serenity,this is after all the twentieth century and we do not think it too much to ask that the members of our community dress in a manner appropriate to the time and place,roth
4997,4998,woodenton as you may not know has long been the home of welltodo protestants,it is only since the war that jews have been able to buy property here and for jews and gentiles to live beside each other in amity,roth
4999,5000,for this adjustment to be made both jews and gentiles alike have had to give up some of their more extreme practices in order not to threaten or offend the other,certainly such amity is to be desired,roth
5001,5002,perhaps if such conditions had existed in prewar europe the persecution of the jewish people of which you and those children have been victims could not have been carried out with such fact might not have been carried out at all,therefore mr,roth
5003,5004,tzuref will you accept the following conditions,if you can we will see fit not to carry out legal action against the yeshivah for failure to comply with township zoning ordinances no,roth
5005,5006,and no,the religious educational and social activities of the yeshivah of woodenton will be confined to the yeshivah grounds,roth
5007,5008,yeshivah personnel are welcomed in the streets and stores of woodenton provided they are attired in clothing usually associated with american life in the century,if these conditions are met we see no reason why the yeshivah of woodenton can not live peacefully and satisfactorily with the jews of the jews of woodenton have come to live with the gentiles of woodenton,roth
5009,5010,i would appreciate an immediate reply,he reached out with his briefcase as if to stop them but they were gone so fast all he saw moving was a flock of skullcaps,roth
5011,5012,come a voice called from the porch,tzuref appeared from behind a pillar,roth
5013,5014,did he live behind those pillars,was he just watching the children at play,roth
5015,5016,either way when eli appeared tzuref was ready with no forewarning,hello eli said,roth
5017,5018,the little movement seemed to eli strong as an accusation,what he didn t get at home he got here,roth
5019,5020,inside the house they took their seats,though it was lighter than a few evenings before a bulb or two would have helped,roth
5021,5022,eli had to hold his briefcase towards the window for the last gleamings,he removed tzuref s letter from a manila folder,roth
5023,5024,tzuref removed eli s letter from his pants pocket,eli removed the carbon of his own letter from another manila folder,roth
5025,5026,tzuref removed eli s first letter from his back pocket,eli removed the carbon from his briefcase,roth
5027,5028,tzuref raised his palms,it was a crime to keep carbons,roth
5029,5030,everybody had an edge on could do no right,i offered a compromise mr,roth
5031,5032,tzuref,peck,roth
5033,5034,tzuref,nothing,roth
5035,5036,you have that word in english,nicht,roth
5037,5038,no,a wife,roth
5039,5040,no,a baby,roth
5041,5042,a little tenmonthold baby,no,roth
5043,5044,a village full of friends,a synagogue where you knew the feel of every seat under your pants,roth
5045,5046,where with your eyes closed you could smell the cloth of the torah tzuref pushed out of his chair stirring a breeze that swept eli s letter to the floor,at the window he leaned out and looked beyond woodenton,roth
5047,5048,when he turned he was shaking a finger at eli,and a medical experiment they performed on him yet,roth
5049,5050,that leaves nothing mr,peck,roth
5051,5052,tzuref,mr,roth
5053,5054,tzuref eli demanded,here he smacked his hand to his billfold,roth
5055,5056,exactly tzuref said smacking his own breast,then we ll buy him one eli crossed to the window and taking tzuref by the shoulders pronounced each word slowly,roth
5057,5058,wewillpayforit,oh stupid,roth
5059,5060,tzuref father to eighteen had smacked not what lay under his coat but deeper under the ribs,eli said,roth
5061,5062,he moved away along the wall,eli stayed back in the shadow and tzuref turned to his chair,roth
5063,5064,he swished eli s letter from the floor and held it up,you have the word suffer,roth
5065,5066,then try it,but you mr,roth
5067,5068,in the dark he suddenly felt that tzuref might put him under a spell,mr,roth
5069,5070,eli was afraid to ask if they couldn t afford electricity,maybe candles were all they had left,roth
5071,5072,mr,before the people there was no law eh didn t care for the conversation but with only candlelight he was being lulled into it,roth
5073,5074,wrong tzuref said,we make the law mr,roth
5075,5076,tzuref,it is our community,roth
5077,5078,these are my neighbors,i am their attorney,roth
5079,5080,they pay me,the heart mr,roth
5081,5082,peck the heart is law,god he announced,roth
5083,5084,look mr,tzuref i didn t come here to talk metaphysics,roth
5085,5086,people use the law it s a flexible thing,they hide their shame,roth
5087,5088,and you mr,for me the fiftyeighth he pointed at eli,roth
5089,5090,everybody in the world had evil reasons for his actions,everybody,roth
5091,5092,with reasons so cheap who buys bulbs,enough wisdom mr,roth
5093,5094,tzuref,please,roth
5095,5096,he picked eli s papers from his desk and reached up with them,i m not the only lawyer in the world,roth
5097,5098,i ll drop the case and you ll get somebody who won t talk compromise,then you ll have no home no children nothing,roth
5099,5100,only a lousy black suit,sacrifice what you want,roth
5101,5102,it s not me mr,they are them,roth
5103,5104,tzuref you re driving me crazy with talmudic wisdom,this is that that is the other thing,roth
5105,5106,then that s all he said angrily,tzuref gave him the shrug,roth
5107,5108,doubletalk proved nothing,goodbye he said,roth
5109,5110,but as he opened the door leading to the hall he heard tzuref,when his fingers formed the hem they touched the floor,roth
5111,5112,he says she is beautiful,she has a kind face,roth
5113,5114,and good know what it is to have children,sholom tzuref whispered and with the whisper the candles went out,roth
5115,5116,but the instant before the flames leaped into tzuref s eyes and eli saw it was not luck tzuref wished him at all,outside the door eli waited,roth
5117,5118,down the lawn the children were holding hands and whirling around in a circle,at first he did not move,roth
5119,5120,but he could not hide in the shadows all night,slowly he began to slip along the front of the house,roth
5121,5122,under his hands he felt where bricks were out,he moved in the shadows until he reached the side,roth
5123,5124,and then clutching his briefcase to his chest he broke across the darkest spots of the lawn,he aimed for a distant glade of woods and when he reached it he did not stop but ran through until he was so dizzied that the trees seemed to be running beside him fleeing not towards woodenton but away,roth
5125,5126,his lungs were nearly ripping their seams as he burst into the yellow glow of the gulf station at the edge of town,eli i had pains today,roth
5127,5128,eli talk to me,sit down,roth
5129,5130,have dinner,eli what are you doing,roth
5131,5132,then he peered in was a zipping noise and suddenly he swept a greenish tweed suit before his wife s eyes,eli i love you in that suit,roth
5133,5134,but not now,have something to eat,roth
5135,5136,suppose this time you give me the reasons before i tell you what i m doing,he extracted a shirt,roth
5137,5138,eli batiste,with a tweed suit she inquired,roth
5139,5140,he was at the closet now on his knees,stop it or i ll call dr,roth
5141,5142,he was draped not only with his own clothing but also with the greenish tweed suit the batiste shirt and under each arm a shoe,he raised his arms and let the shoes drop onto the bed,roth
5143,5144,then he undid his necktie with one hand and his teeth and added that to the booty,underwear he said,roth
5145,5146,miriam kneeled down and helped him ease his left foot out of the sock,she sat with it on the floor,roth
5147,5148,eli just lie back,she kissed the foot she held,roth
5149,5150,don t tell me why miriam,something gets too much,roth
5151,5152,whenever everything s peaceful for a long time and things are nice and pleasant and we re expecting to be even happier,like now,roth
5153,5154,i m giving this guy a new suit is that all right,everybody did,roth
5155,5156,that s what everybody wants,why make everybody unhappy,roth
5157,5158,his wife sat on the end of the sofa looking like an anchored balloon,where s the green suit he said,roth
5159,5160,eli it s your loveliest suit,it s my favorite suit,roth
5161,5162,that s your trouble,you won t do anything in moderation,roth
5163,5164,that s my trouble,why does it have to be your suit,roth
5165,5166,who are you even to decide to give a suit,what about the others she was crying openly and holding her belly,roth
5167,5168,eli i m going to have a baby,do we need all this and she swept the clothes off the sofa to the floor,roth
5169,5170,at the closet eli removed the green suit,it s a j press he said looking at the lining,roth
5171,5172,i hope to hell he s happy with it miriam said sobbing,a half hour later the box was packed,roth
5173,5174,the cord he d found in the kitchen cabinet couldn t keep the outfit from popping through,the trouble was there was too much the gray suit and the green suit an oxford shirt as well as the batiste,roth
5175,5176,but let him have two suits,let him have three four if only this damn silliness would stop,roth
5177,5178,and a course,god he d almost forgotten the hat,roth
5179,5180,he took the stairs two at a time and in miriam s closet yanked a hatbox from the top shelf,scattering hat and tissue paper to the floor he returned downstairs where he packed away the hat he d worn that day,roth
5181,5182,then he looked at his wife who lay outstretched on the floor before the fireplace,he said but you have two more somehow he d really been expecting it was to go on not just another two weeks but another nine months,roth
5183,5184,this led him to suspect suddenly that his wife was feigning pain so as to get his mind off delivering the suit,and just as suddenly he resented himself for having such a thought,roth
5185,5186,god what had he become,he d been an unending bastard towards her since this tzuref business had come when her pregnancy must have been most burdensome,roth
5187,5188,he d allowed her no access to him but still he was sure for good reasons she might tempt him out of his confusion with her easy answers,he could be tempted all right it was why he fought so hard,roth
5189,5190,but now a sweep of love came over him at the thought of her contracting womb and his child,and yet he would not indicate it to her,roth
5191,5192,under such splendid marital conditions who knows but she might extract some promise from him about his concern with the school on the hill,having packed his second bag of the evening eli sped his wife to woodenton memorial,roth
5193,5194,there she proceeded not to have her baby but to lie hour after hour through the night having at first oranges then bowling balls then basketballs squeezed back of her pelvis,eli sat in the waiting room under the shattering african glare of a dozen rows of fluorescent bulbs composing a letter to tzuref,roth
5195,5196,dear mr,in a life of sacrifice what is one more,roth
5197,5198,but in a life of no sacrifices even one is impossible,do you see what i m saying mr,roth
5199,5200,tzuref,i am not a nazi who would drive eighteen children who are probably frightened at the sight of a firefly into homelessness,roth
5201,5202,but if you want a home here you must accept what we have to offer,the world is the world mr,roth
5203,5204,tzuref,as you would say what is is,roth
5205,5206,all we say to this man is change your clothes,enclosed are two suits and two shirts and everything else he ll need including a new hat,roth
5207,5208,when he needs new clothes let me know,we await his appearance in woodenton as we await friendly relations with the yeshivah of woodenton,roth
5209,5210,he signed his name and slid the note under a bursting flap and into the box,then he went to the phone at the end of the room and dialed ted heller s number,roth
5211,5212,the lights are on in your place but nobody answers,and suppose he doesn t change eli,roth
5213,5214,just suppose,i mean that might happen eli,roth
5215,5216,the other end was quiet a moment,look eli ted said finally he changes,roth
5217,5218,okay,all right,roth
5219,5220,but they re still up there aren t they,when we put our faith and trust in you is that what we were asking,roth
5221,5222,we weren t concerned that this guy should become a beau brummel eli believe me,we just don t think this is the community for them,roth
5223,5224,and eli we isn t me,the jewish members of the community appointed me artie and harry to see what could be done,roth
5225,5226,and we appointed you,i realize that eli,roth
5227,5228,but this is a matter of zoning isn t it,isn t that what we discovered,roth
5229,5230,you don t abide by the ordinance you go,eli we ve been through this and through this,roth
5231,5232,we re not just dealing with are religious fanatics is what they are,dressing like that,roth
5233,5234,what i d really like to find out is what goes on up there,i m getting more and more skeptical eli and i m not afraid to admit it,roth
5235,5236,it smells like a lot of hocuspocus abracadabra stuff to me,guys like harry you know they think and they think and they re afraid to admit what they re thinking,roth
5237,5238,i ll tell you,look i don t even know about this sunday school business,roth
5239,5240,sundays i drive my oldest kid all the way to scarsdale to learn bible stories and you know what she comes up with,this abraham in the bible was going to kill his own kid for a sacrifice,roth
5241,5242,she gets nightmares from it for god s sake,you call that religion,roth
5243,5244,today a guy like that they d lock him up,this is an age of science eli,roth
5245,5246,i size people s feet with an xray machine for god s sake,you ll see when you have your own what it s like,roth
5247,5248,all the place is is a hideaway for people who can t face life,it s a matter of needs,roth
5249,5250,they have all these superstitions and why do you think,because they can t face the world because they can t take their place in society,roth
5251,5252,we can convert them eli said with half a heart,what make a bunch of catholics out of them,roth
5253,5254,look there s a good healthy relationship in this town because it s modern jews and protestants,that s the point isn t it eli,roth
5255,5256,let s not kid each other i m not harry,the way things are now are human beings,roth
5257,5258,there s going to be no pogroms in woodenton,right,roth
5259,5260,cause there s no fanatics no crazy eli winced and closed his eyes a just people who respect each other and leave each other be,common sense is the ruling thing eli,roth
5261,5262,i m for common sense,i agree but common sense maybe says make this guy change his clothes,roth
5263,5264,common sense says to me they go and find a nice place somewhere else eli,do they display common sense,roth
5265,5266,talking a dead language that makes sense,making a big thing out of suffering so you re going oyoyoy all your life that s common sense,roth
5267,5268,look eli we ve been through all this,i don t know if you there s talk that life magazine is sending a guy out to the yeshivah for a story,roth
5269,5270,let him just change the clothes ted,i m all wrapped up here with miriam having a baby,roth
5271,5272,i want to be fair,but tomorrow that s all,roth
5273,5274,he was shaking s voice seemed to have separated his bones at the joints,he was still in the phone booth when the nurse came to tell him that mrs,roth
5275,5276,peck would positively not be delivered of a child until the morning,he was to go home and get some rest he looked like he was having the baby,roth
5277,5278,the nurse winked and left,but eli did not go home,roth
5279,5280,he carried the bonwit box out into the street with him and put it in the car,the night was soft and starry and he began to drive the streets of woodenton,roth
5281,5282,square cool windows apricotcolored were all one could see beyond the long lawns that fronted the homes of the townsmen,the stars polished the permanent baggage carriers atop the station wagons in the driveways,roth
5283,5284,he drove slowly up down around,only his tires could be heard taking the gentle curves in the road,roth
5285,5286,what peace,what incredible peace,roth
5287,5288,have children ever been so safe in their beds,full in their stomachs,roth
5289,5290,water so warm in its boilers,never,roth
5291,5292,never in rome never in greece,never even did walled cities have it so good,roth
5293,5294,no wonder then they would keep things just as they were,here after all were peace and civilization had been working toward for centuries,roth
5295,5296,for all his jerkiness that was all ted heller was asking for peace and safety,it was what his parents had asked for in the bronx and his grandparents in poland and theirs in russia or austria or wherever else they d fled to or from,roth
5297,5298,it was what miriam was asking for,and now they had world was at last a place for families even jewish families,roth
5299,5300,after all these centuries maybe there just had to be this communal protect such a blessing,maybe that was the trouble with the jews all soft,roth
5301,5302,sure to live takes guts eli was thinking as he drove on beyond the train station and parked his car at the darkened gulf station,he stepped out carrying the box,roth
5303,5304,at the top of the hill one window trembled with light,what was tzuref doing up there in that office,roth
5305,5306,killing not,but studying a language no one understood,roth
5307,5308,practicing customs with origins long forgotten,suffering sufferings already suffered once too often,roth
5309,5310,teddie was keep it up,however if a man chose to be stubborn then he couldn t expect to survive,roth
5311,5312,the world is giveandtake,what sense to sit and brood over a suit,roth
5313,5314,eli would give him one last chance,he stopped at the top,roth
5315,5316,no one was around,he walked slowly up the lawn setting each foot into the grass listening to the shh shhh shhhh his shoes made as they bent the wetness into the sod,roth
5317,5318,he looked around,here there was nothing,roth
5319,5320,nothing,an old decaying a suit,roth
5321,5322,on the porch he slid behind a pillar,he felt someone was watching him,roth
5323,5324,but only the stars gleamed down,and at his feet off and away woodenton glowed up,roth
5325,5326,he set his package on the step of the great front door,inside the cover of the box he felt to see if his letter was still there,roth
5327,5328,when he touched it he pushed it deeper into the green suit which his fingers still remembered from winter,he should have included some light bulbs,roth
5329,5330,then he slid back by the pillar again and this time there was something on the lawn,it was the second sight he had of him,roth
5331,5332,he was facing woodenton and barely moving across the open space towards the trees,his right fist was beating his chest,roth
5333,5334,and then eli heard a sound rising with each knock on the chest,what a moan,roth
5335,5336,it could raise hair stop hearts water eyes,and it did all three to eli plus more,roth
5337,5338,some feeling crept into him for whose deepness he could find no word,it was strange,roth
5339,5340,he did not hurt to hear this moan,but he wondered if it hurt to make it,roth
5341,5342,and so with only stars to hear he tried,and it did hurt,roth
5343,5344,not the bumblebee of noise that turned at the back of his throat and winged out his nostrils,what hurt buzzed down,roth
5345,5346,it stung and stung inside him and in turn the moan sharpened,it became a scream louder a song a crazy song that whined through the pillars and blew out to the grass until the strange hatted creature on the lawn turned and threw his arms wide and looked in the night like a scarecrow,roth
5347,5348,eli ran and when he reached the car the pain was only a bloody scratch across his neck where a branch had whipped back as he fled the greenie s arms,the following day his son was born,roth
5349,5350,but not till one in the afternoon and by then a great deal had happened,first at ninethirty the phone rang,roth
5351,5352,eli leaped from the he d dropped the night picked it screaming from the cradle,eli he did it,roth
5353,5354,he just walked by the store,i was opening the door eli and i turned around and i swear i thought it was you,roth
5355,5356,but it was him,he has on man s regular clothes,roth
5357,5358,he s just strolling in the green suit like it s a holiday,eli it worked,roth
5359,5360,when it began to perk he held his head over the pot so it would steam loose the knot back of his eyes,it still hadn t when the phone rang,roth
5361,5362,eli ted again,eli the guy s walking up and down every street in town,roth
5363,5364,really he s on a tour or something,artie called me herb called me,roth
5365,5366,now shirley calls that he just walked by our house,he couldn t see past the bend in the road and there was no one in sight,roth
5367,5368,eli he heard ted from where he dangled over the telephone table,he dropped the phone into the hook as a few last words floated up to he threw on the pants and shirt he d worn the night before and walked barefoot on to his front lawn,roth
5369,5370,and sure enough his apparition appeared around the bend in a brown hat a little too far down on his head a green suit too far back on the shoulders an unbuttoneddown buttondown shirt a tie knotted so as to leave a twoinch tail trousers that cascaded onto his was shorter than that black hat had made him seem,and moving the clothes was that walk that was not a walk the tinystepped shlumpy gait,roth
5371,5372,he came round the bend and for all his clung to his whiskers signaled itself in his looked as if he belonged,eccentric maybe but he belonged,roth
5373,5374,he made no moan nor did he invite eli with wideflung arms,but he did stop when he saw him,roth
5375,5376,he stopped and put a hand to his hat,when he felt for its top his hand went up too high,roth
5377,5378,then it found the level and fiddled with the brim,the fingers fiddled fumbled and when they d finally made their greeting they traveled down the fellow s face and in an instant seemed to have touched each one of his featuresthey dabbed the eyes ran the length of the nose swept over the hairy lip until they found their home in the hair that hid a little of his collar,roth
5379,5380,to eli the fingers said i have a face i have a face at least,then his hand came through the beard and when it stopped at his chest it was like a the eyes asked a question as tides of water shifted over them,roth
5381,5382,the face is all right i can keep it,such a look was in those eyes that eli was still seeing them when he turned his head away,roth
5383,5384,they were the hearts of his jonquils that only last week had were the leaves on his birch the bulbs in his coach lamp the droppings on his lawn those eyes were the eyes in his head,they were his he had made them,roth
5385,5386,he turned and went into his house and when he peeked out the side of the window between shade and molding the green suit was gone,the phone,roth
5387,5388,he sat frozen for a long time,the sun moved around the windows,roth
5389,5390,the coffee steam smelled up the house,the phone began to ring stopped began again,roth
5391,5392,the mailman came the cleaner the bakery man the gardener the ice cream man the league of women voters lady,a negro woman spreading some strange gospel calling for the revision of the food and drug act knocked at the front rapped the windows and finally scraped a halfdozen pamphlets under the back door,roth
5393,5394,but eli only sat without underwear in last night s suit,he answered no one,roth
5395,5396,given his condition it was strange that the trip and crash at the back door reached his inner ear,but in an instant he seemed to melt down into the crevices of the chair then to splash up and out to where the clatter had been,roth
5397,5398,at the door he waited,it was silent but for a fluttering of damp little leaves on the trees,roth
5399,5400,when he finally opened the door there was no one there,he d expected to see green green green big as the doorway topped by his hat waiting for him with those eyes,roth
5401,5402,but there was no one out there except for the bonwit s box which lay bulging at his feet,no string tied it and the top rode high on the bottom,roth
5403,5404,the coward,he couldn t do it,roth
5405,5406,he couldn t,the very glee of that idea pumped fuel to his legs,roth
5407,5408,he tore out across his back lawn past his new spray of forsythia to catch a glimpse of the bearded one fleeing naked through yards over hedges and fences to the safety of his hermitage,in the distance a pile of pink and white harriet knudson had painted the previous him,roth
5409,5410,run he shouted to the rocks run but he caught his error before anyone else did and though he peered and craned there was no hint anywhere of a man about his own size with white white terribly white skin how white must be the skin of his body,in cowardly retreat,roth
5411,5412,he came slowly curiously back to the door,and while the trees shimmered in the light wind he removed the top from the box,roth
5413,5414,the shock at first was the shock of having daylight turned off all at once,inside the box was an eclipse,roth
5415,5416,but black soon sorted from black and shortly there was the glassy black of lining the coarse black of trousers the dead black of fraying threads and in the center the mountain of black the hat,he picked the box from the doorstep and carried it inside,roth
5417,5418,for the first time in his life he smelted the color of blackness a little stale a little sour a little old but nothing that could overwhelm you,still he held the package at arm s length and deposited it on the dining room table,roth
5419,5420,twenty rooms on a hill and they store their old clothes with me,what am i supposed to do with them,roth
5421,5422,give them to charity,that s where they came from,roth
5423,5424,he picked up the hat by the edges and looked inside,the crown was smooth as an egg the brim practically threadbare,roth
5425,5426,there is nothing else to do with a hat in one s hands but put it on so eli dropped the thing on his head,he opened the door to the hall closet and looked at himself in the fulllength mirror,roth
5427,5428,the hat gave him bags under the eyes,or perhaps he had not slept well,roth
5429,5430,he pushed the brim lower till a shadow touched his lips,now the bags under his eyes had inflated to become his face,roth
5431,5432,before the mirror he unbuttoned his shirt unzipped his trousers and then shedding his clothes he studied what he was,mat a silly disappointment to see yourself naked in a hat,roth
5433,5434,especially in that hat,he sighed but could not rid himself of the great weakness that suddenly set on his muscles and joints beneath the terrible weight of the stranger s strange hat,roth
5435,5436,he returned to the dining room table and emptied the box of its contents jacket trousers and vest it smelled deeper than blackness,and under it all sticking between the shoes that looked chopped and bitten came the first gleam of white,roth
5437,5438,a little fringed serape a gray piece of semiunderwear was crumpled at the bottom its thready border twisted into itself,eli removed it and let it hang free,roth
5439,5440,what is it,for warmth,roth
5441,5442,to wear beneath underwear in the event of a chest cold,he held it to his nose but it did not smell from vick s or mustard plaster,roth
5443,5444,it was something special some jewish thing,special food special language special prayers why not special bvd s,roth
5445,5446,so fearful was he that he would be tempted back into wearing his traditional he had carried and buried in woodenton everything including the special underwear,for that was how eli now understood the box of clothes,roth
5447,5448,the greenie was saying here i give up,i refuse even to be tempted,roth
5449,5450,we surrender,and that was how eli continued to understand it until he found he d slipped the white fringy surrender flag over his hat and felt it clinging to his chest,roth
5451,5452,and now looking at himself in the mirror he was momentarily uncertain as to who was tempting who into what,why did the greenie leave his clothes,roth
5453,5454,was it even the greenie,then who was it,roth
5455,5456,and why,but eli for christ s sake in an age of science things don t happen like that,roth
5457,5458,he had to pull down on the trousers so they would not show the hollow of his ankle,the greenie didn t he wear socks,roth
5459,5460,or had he forgotten them,the mystery was solved when eli mustered enough courage to investigate the trouser pockets,roth
5461,5462,he had expected some damp awful thing to happen to his fingers should he slip them down and out of when at last he jammed bravely down he came up with a khaki army sock in each hand,as he slipped them over his toes he invented a genesis a gi s present in,roth
5463,5464,plus everything else lost between and he had also lost his socks,not that he had lost the socks but that he d had to stoop to accepting these made eli almost cry,roth
5465,5466,to calm himself he walked out the back door and stood looking at his lawn,on the knudson back lawn harriet knudson was giving her stones a second coat of pink,roth
5467,5468,she looked up just as eli stepped out,eli shot back in again and pressed himself against the back door,roth
5469,5470,when he peeked between the curtain all he saw were paint bucket brush and rocks scattered on the knudsons pinkspattered grass,the phone rang,roth
5471,5472,who was knudson,eli there s a jew at your door,roth
5473,5474,open up alex,i want you to open up this instant,roth
5475,5476,it s locked i m not caught,and i see from what s alive in my hand that i m not quite dead yet either,roth

5519,5520,because he eats chazerai,but it s not a joke,roth

5539,5540,i believe she considers the question unanswerable,yet that this is precisely the horrible thing is beyond my understanding and still doctor,roth
5541,5542,to this day,i brace myself now for the whispering,roth
5543,5544,i can spot the whispering coming a mile away,alex he did nt have a headache on him today that he could hardly see straight from it,roth

5549,5550,success,i am crying,roth
5551,5552,yes she has me where she wants me and she knows it,how easily his inadequacies can move me to tears,roth
5553,5554,as easily as they move me to anger,a person my father often held up to me as someone to emulate in life was the theatrical producer billy rose,roth
5555,5556,alex where would billy rose be today without his shorthand,nowhere,roth
5557,5558,earlier it was the piano we battled over,your little cousin toby can sit down at the piano and play whatever song you can name,roth

5989,5990,what could i be talking about,but i will not treat any human being outside my family as inferior,roth
5991,5992,is that clear to everyone,and that goes for the goyim too,roth
5993,5994,we all have nt been lucky enough to have been born jews you know,because i am sick and tired of goyische this and goyische that,roth
5995,5996,ca nt you see my dear parents from whose loins i somehow leaped that such thinking is a trifle barbaric,the very first distinction i learned from you,roth
5997,5998,you narrowminded schmucks oh how i hate you for your jewish narrowminded minds,including you,roth
5999,6000,jew jew jew jew jew jew,but you are a jew my sister says,roth

6005,6006,do you know she asks me where you would be now if you had been born in europe instead of america,that is nt the issue hannah,roth

6009,6010,dead,gassed or shot or incinerated or butchered or buried alive,roth
6011,6012,do you know that,and your mother and your father would be dead,roth
6013,6014,but why are you taking their side,i m not taking anybody s side she says,roth
6015,6016,i m only telling you he s not such an ignorant person as you think,and she is nt either i suppose,roth
6017,6018,i suppose the nazis make everything she says and does smart and brilliant too,or so i think,roth
6019,6020,an exquisite day,you might have thought that given the rich satisfactions of the day,roth
6021,6022,at any rate how insane whipping out my joint like that,imagine if i had gone ahead and come all over that sleeping shikse s golden arm,roth
6023,6024,now maybe the lobster is what did it,all you have to do is stop trembling and quaking and finding it unimaginable and beyond you all you have to do is do it,roth
6025,6026,practice darling practice practice practice,why else the two sets of dishes,roth
6027,6028,now who s the schmuck hub,selfcontrol sobriety sanctionsthis is the key to a human life saith all those endless dietary laws,roth
6029,6030,you stupid goyim,they will eat anything anything they can get their big goy hands on,roth
6031,6032,deer eat what deer eat and jews eat what jews eat but not these goyim,thus saith the kosher laws and who am i to argue that they re wrong,roth
6033,6034,and his superior jewish brain might as well be made of matzoh brei,such a creature needless to say has never been boiled alive in our housethe lobster i refer to,roth
6035,6036,ha ha,a shikse has never been in our house because i have brought her there is what i mean to say,roth
6037,6038,doctor could he have been slipping it to her,i ca nt believe it,roth
6039,6040,only it suddenly occurs to me,was nt he,roth
6041,6042,why he brought her home he said was for a real jewish meal,all right bring her alreadyshe needs it so bad so i ll give her one,roth
6043,6044,was he caught a little by surprise,who will ever know,roth
6045,6046,at any rate a jewish meal is what she got all right,this is your real jewish chopped liver anne,roth
6047,6048,have you ever had real jewish chopped liver before,here you eat it with a piece of bread,roth
6049,6050,this is real jewish rye bread with seeds,or because you could no longer live your own life without making jewish confession,roth
6051,6052,i recognize the syndrome perfectly,chose pleasure for myself over duty to my loved ones,roth
6053,6054,and did my mother oblige,did sophie put together the two tits and the two legs and come up with four,roth
6055,6056,oh i must be making this up really,my father,roth
6057,6058,and a shikse,ca nt be,roth
6059,6060,my own father fucked shikses,i ll admit under duress that he fucked my mother,roth
6061,6062,but shikses,but then why is she shouting at him so what is this scene of accusation and denial of castigation and threat and unending tears,roth
6063,6064,what is this all about except that he has done something that is very bad and maybe even unforgivable,oh this is pure fantasy this is right out of the casebook is it not,roth
6065,6066,that is a lie and wrong,the culprit is me,roth
6067,6068,that s the kind of person i am,i ca nt do it and that s that,roth
6069,6070,oh poor mother,but look what is going on here after all,roth
6071,6072,surely doctor we can figure this thing out two smart jewish boys like ourselves,okay,roth
6073,6074,so far so good,well good christ how was i supposed to know all that hannah,roth
6075,6076,i m eight years old and chocolate pudding happens to get me hot,furthermore i thought it was left over,roth
6077,6078,jesus christ is that what this screaming and shrying is all about that i ate that sad sack s chocolate pudding,i thought it was something else,roth
6079,6080,i swear i swear i did nt mean to do it,shit the next thing he ll tell her is why he should be forgiven is because he did nt like it either,roth
6081,6082,then stick up for yourself now like a man,and slug her if you have to,roth
6083,6084,deck her jake,what after all does it consist of,roth
6085,6086,you put your dick some place and moved it back and forth and stuff came out the front,so jake what s the big deal,roth
6087,6088,we must nt,daddy has done a terrible terrible thing cries my mother or is that my imagination,roth
6089,6090,she s not even supposed to eat chocolate pudding,yeah that s why i took it,roth
6091,6092,i ca nt help it if you re fat and sluggish and i m skinny and brilliant,and is that my fault too,roth
6093,6094,apparently this is the way god wants it to be hannah,in the big book,roth
6095,6096,you know i can really come up with no more than a dozen memories involving my sister from those early years of my childhood,why we can eat pig on pell street and not at home is because,roth
6097,6098,imagine,no wonder the waiters ca nt intimidate us,roth
6099,6100,to them we re just some bignosed variety of wasp,boy do we eat,roth
6101,6102,but why then ca nt we eat a lobster too disguised as something else,allow my mother a logical explanation,roth
6103,6104,ready,why we ca nt eat lobster,roth
6105,6106,because it can kill you,because i ate it once and i nearly died,roth
6107,6108,yes she too has committed her transgressions and has been duly punished,doyle,roth
6109,6110,wanton hussy,subsequently she was over the toilet all night throwing up,roth

6123,6124,not she says if i know what is good for me,whew,roth
6125,6126,have i got grievances,do i harbor hatreds i did nt even know were there,roth
6127,6128,is it the process,all i do is complain the repugnance seems bottomless and i m beginning to wonder if maybe enough is nt enough,roth
6129,6130,or is kvetching for people like me a form of truth,what else,roth
6131,6132,walks walks with my father in weequahic park on sundays that i still have nt forgotten,and mind you i am only four,roth
6133,6134,also spatula,but for the life of me i could not think of the word in english,roth

6185,6186,or is it only a means of evasion,i mean the nightmarish depression some people suffer at bedtime,roth
6187,6188,of course you ca nt have everything or so i understand but the question i am willing to face is have i anything,how much longer do i go on conducting these experiments with women,roth
6189,6190,and so on,when will it end,roth

6583,6584,no,no,roth
6585,6586,no,lina spoke first and the monkey turned to translate,roth
6587,6588,ill bet she says that to all the boys,then they stood there in their underwear looking my way waiting,roth
6589,6590,and was my heart pounding,it had to come to pass two women and me,roth
6591,6592,so now what happens,she wants to know said the monkey after lina had spoken a second time where the signore would like her to begin,roth
6593,6594,finally it is the monkey who sets our lust in motion,is nt she really sufficient for my needs,roth
6595,6596,and puts her hand between the whore s legs,i can best describe the state i subsequently entered as one of unrelieved busyness,roth
6597,6598,boy was i busy,and so it went doctor until i came my third and final time,roth
6599,6600,my kishkas,motherthrew them right up into the toilet bowl,roth
6601,6602,is nt that a good boy,when i came out of the bathroom,roth
6603,6604,the monkey and lina were lying asleep in one another s arms,the monkey s pathetic weeping the recriminations and the accusations began immediately after lina had dressed and departed,roth
6605,6606,i bad delivered her into evil,me,roth
6607,6608,you re the one who stuck your finger up her snatch and got the ball rolling,because she screamed if i m going to do something then like i do it,roth
6609,6610,but that does nt mean i want to,and then,roth
6611,6612,doctor she began to berate me about lina s tits how i had nt played with them enough,other people s tits,roth
6613,6614,nothing,do nt you dare call me a lesbian,roth
6615,6616,because if i am you made me one,then we wo nt do it again for me all right,roth
6617,6618,not if this is the fucking ridiculous result,if i m going to do it i thought,roth
6619,6620,i m going to do it,all the way,roth
6621,6622,everything,and no vomiting either,roth
6623,6624,you re not in weequahic high school any more,you re nowhere near new jersey,roth
6625,6626,when the monkey stepped out of the bathroom and saw that the ball game was already under way she was nt entirely pleased,i could nt believe that she had never heard of either the diaphragm or the birthcontrol pill,roth
6627,6628,the whore listened but was skeptical,oh you are some savior,roth
6629,6630,the monkey shouted after lina had left,what do you want her to do get knocked up every other week,roth
6631,6632,what sense does that make,what do i care what happens to her,roth
6633,6634,said the monkey her voice turning rural and mean,she s the whore,roth
6635,6636,you could nt even wait until i was out of the john to do it,and then you gave her my pills,roth
6637,6638,and what s that mean hub,what exactly are you trying to say,roth
6639,6640,a talent for frankness yes for reason no,then leave me,roth

6643,6644,maybe i will,to you i m just another her anyway,roth
6645,6646,skip the fight,it s boring,roth
6647,6648,lina s hair is down and her dark eyes fresh from church have a familiarly itahan mournful expression,a sweet person i ca nt get over this,roth
6649,6650,and she has come to show off her bambino,or so it looks,roth
6651,6652,pointing to the little boy she whispers to the monkey molto elegante no,no of course,roth
6653,6654,positively not,no,roth
6655,6656,all the way to the villa adriana she weeps i want a child too,and a home,roth
6657,6658,and a husband,i am not a lesbian,roth
6659,6660,i am not a whore,all those poor puerto rican people being overcharged in the supermarket,roth
6661,6662,tell me about your bad sanitation tell me about your rats and vermin tell me about your police protection,because discrimination is against the law,roth
6663,6664,a year in prison or a fivehundreddollar fine,oh you fake alex,roth

6685,6686,god,what a country,roth
6687,6688,is it any wonder we re all of us half nuts,but the shikses ah the shikses are something else again,roth
6689,6690,my circumcised little dong is simply shriveled up with veneration,how do they get so gorgeous so healthy so blond,roth
6691,6692,maybe a pride of shikses is more like it or is it a pride of shkotzim,not portnoy or pincus but smith and jones and brown,roth
6693,6694,an open fire in my house,no no theirs are the noses whereof he speaks,roth
6695,6696,america,amer ica,roth

6701,6702,then i follow them around the lake,what a rise in social class we have made with those blinds,roth
6703,6704,it is usually only a matter of minutes before she is appropriately frantic,where is he already,roth
6705,6706,she moans each time a pair of headlights comes sweeping up the street and are not his,apparently in the middle ages in france the door to our family manor house was painted,roth
6707,6708,no no they will hear the oy at the end and the jig will be up,al port then al parsons,roth
6709,6710,how do you do,and wait ll she hears i m from weequahic,roth

6713,6714,screw off jewboy,get off the ice and leave these girls alone,roth
6715,6716,and it s true,i lower my head to the kitchen table and on a piece of my father s office stationery outline my profile with a pencil,roth
6717,6718,how has this happened to me who was so gorgeous in that carriage,mother,roth
6719,6720,no,no,roth

6739,6740,look at the monkey my old pal and partner in crime,but i know i should nt call her or see her ever again,roth
6741,6742,because the bitch is crazy,the sexcrazed bitch is out of her mind,roth
6743,6744,pure trouble,butwhat what was i supposed to be but her jewish savior,roth
6745,6746,if you liked arthur miller as a savior of shikses you ll just love alex,ketch you down by that queer again you and wo nt just tie em up,roth
6747,6748,i ll do more n that do nt you worry,when she first arrived in new york she was eighteen and had nt any back teeth to speak of either,roth
6749,6750,when we two met nearly a year ago now,the monkey had already been through her marriage and her divorce,roth
6751,6752,became a bore to both of them,morris frankel henceforth to be known in these confessions as harpo,roth
6753,6754,why,harpo speak,roth
6755,6756,say something to me,anything,roth
6757,6758,i mean who ever heard of a dead man with an answering service,i was a breakthrough,roth
6759,6760,he did cough however and this the monkey takes as her confirmation,breakie you re so brilliant,roth
6761,6762,i want to be married and human,so i was to be her breakthrough,roth
6763,6764,but was nt she to be mine,who like the monkey had ever happened to me beforeor will again,roth
6765,6766,not that i had not prayed of course,why not,roth
6767,6768,what s lost,what s gained however,roth
6769,6770,go ahead you shackled and fettered son of a bitch speak to her,speak,roth
6771,6772,hi softly and with a little surprise as though i might have met her somewhere before,what do you want,roth
6773,6774,to buy you a drink i said,a real swinger she said sneering,roth
6775,6776,sneering,two seconds and two insults,roth
6777,6778,to the assistant commissioner of human opportunity for this whole city,my god,roth
6779,6780,she s going to call a cop,who ll turn me in to the mayor,roth
6781,6782,that s better she replied,and so a cab pulled up and we went to her apartment where she took off her clothes and said go ahead,roth
6783,6784,my incredulity,that such a thing was happening to me,roth

8323,8324,how my life would change,a new man with this woman,roth
8325,8326,her plan for herself was to camp out at night in a sleeping bag,during the day at dinner then as we walked along the romantic harbor wall at akko that night i told her about my life,roth
8327,8328,she said she would she had much to say about my story,now can that be denied,roth
8329,8330,no,rivalry competition envy jealousy all that is malignant in human character is nourished by the system,roth
8331,8332,because your system is basically exploitive inherently debasing and unjust,and that is indisputable you can not help but agree if you are at all honest,roth
8333,8334,for instance what did you accomplish with your quizscandal hearings,anything,roth
8335,8336,nothing if i may say so,but as for the system that trained them in corruption on that you had not the slightest effect,roth
8337,8338,the system was unshaken,the system was untouched,roth

8481,8482,asslick thank you mr,president,roth
8483,8484,indeed even in the midst of the most incredible international blunders and domestic catastrophes he has till now with the aid of his football uniform and a good war movie been able to live up to his own description of the true leader in six hundred crises as cool confident and decisive,what is essential in such situations he wrote there summarizing what he had learned about leadership from the riots inspired by his visit as vice president to caracas is not so much bravery in the face of danger as the ability to think selflesslyto blank out any thought of personal fear by concentrating completely on how to meet the danger,roth
8485,8486,at the door to the white house each has been issued a uniform by a secret service agent disguised but for a shoulder holster as an ordi nary locker room attendant in sweat pants sneakers and tshirt stenciled property of the white house,now seated on benches before the big blackboard the coaches listen carefully as tricky with his helmet in his hands describes to them the crisis he is having trouble being entirely selfless about,roth

8891,8892,legal coach i ve considered that and i think that the wisest course to follow is not to mention the name of the country itself,political coach jackie and lanceloti ve got to admit we re going to get the headlines on this one,roth
8893,8894,but why jimi hendrix if he s dead,legal coach because we have nt had a rock performer yet,roth
8895,8896,tricky i must say from the sound of it you certainly appear to have thought this through in all its ramifications in only about five minutes,legal coach thank you mr,roth

8917,8918,tricky well let s correct it then because that is just the sort of error inadvertently made that tends to be totally misconstrued by the press,now jim what,roth
8919,8920,there,and i ll initial the change just to make clear exactly who is responsible for both the error and the correction,roth
8921,8922,there,spiritual coach amen,roth
8923,8924,tricky and my friends on that sanctimonious note i am going to call this conference to a close,spiritual coach mr,roth
8925,8926,president it is nearly dawn,you must get some rest,roth

8929,8930,good night gentlemen and thank you,all good night mr,roth
8931,8932,president,they rise to leave tricky and do nt forget to hand in your uni forms at the door,roth
8933,8934,i just could nt help myself,all you can trust us with your secrets mr,roth
8935,8936,president,tricky moved i know i can all right then,roth
8937,8938,now i hear you ask mr,let s look again at the map,roth
8939,8940,the next move is up to copenhagen,what are we asking of copenhagen,roth
8941,8942,what are we asking of copenhagen,who is curt flood,roth
8943,8944,flood was a baseball player for the st,then tragedy struck,roth
8945,8946,to my dear parents,to my loyal and devoted brother,roth
8947,8948,tony,abe fortas and mr,roth
8949,8950,goldbarg,abe fortas joining forces with mr,roth
8951,8952,now you may say to me but surely mr,through jitsp,roth
8953,8954,so i am afraid the,who then you ask did he seek to corrupt,roth
8955,8956,i am sure you all know by now the nature of the chants and the songs that these ten thousand boy scouts were singing in the streets of the nation s capital,i am sure you are familiar with the kind of placards they were waving before the television cameras,roth
8957,8958,i do not intend to repeat to you the wording of those posters,it should suffice to say that they did justice to the language and interests of charles curtis flood whose favorite city according to his own writings is copenhagen denmark the pornography capital of the world,roth
8959,8960,the posters are presently in the hands of the fbi whose laboratories have already begun the painstaking job of fingerprinting each and every poster and submitting them to blood tests so as to determine the correlation between the obscenity printed on an individual poster and the blood type of the boy scout bearing the poster containing those objectionable words,if such correlations can be established with a reasonable degree of accuracyand we think they canit will of course be of great assistance to our law enforcement agencies,roth
8961,8962,as you all know from the headlines of the approximately ten thousand boy scouts who assembled here in washington during the twoday uprising to threaten the lives of our brave fighting men it was necessary to kill only three in order to maintain law and order,that breaks down to one and onehalf scouts dead per diem while nine thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight and a half scouts continued to live full and active lives the first day and nine thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven the second,roth
8963,8964,now i would think that by anyone s standards a mortality rate in a crisis of this kind of is a wonderful tribute to the very great restraint with which we were able to confront what could have been a terrible tragedy for our soldiers,certainly it should give solace to all of those who detest bloodshed as much as i do and put the lie once and for all to the vicious charge that it was the military and not the scouts who were responsible for the violence,roth
8965,8966,of course i am sure the great majority of americans realize that there is always going to be a small vocal minority of cavilers and critics who are never going to be satisfied no matter how perfectly balanced the restraint and the firmness with which we deal with civil disruptions of this kind,even if there should be only one person dead over a twoday period or as little as half a person a day even if over a twoday period there should be only one person who is slightly maimedthese critics will begin to talk as though the tragedy was nt the overwhelming danger to which tens of thousands of our brave soldiers were subjected but the maiming of one person out of only ten thousand and what is more than likely an outoftowner who unlike our brave soldiers had only to remain at home to stay out of harm s way,roth
8967,8968,well to this small vocal minority let me make one thing very clear,i too have great sympathy for the families of the three boy scouts who were killed here in washington,roth
8969,8970,i am a father and i know full well how important children can be to a man s career and incidentally in that connection a wife,i am proud to say that my wife and my daughters were prepared to work far into the night in order that families less fortunate than our own might have some small comfort in their hour of need,roth
8971,8972,nor do we intend to forget these people when christmas time rolls around,but let there be no mistake about it quick on the trigger as i may be with compassion for the innocent families i am equally swift in my condemnation of these three guilty scouts,roth
8973,8974,and i say guilty because if they were not guilty they would not be dead,that is not the kind of country we live in,roth
8975,8976,now i know there are those apologists for the boy scout uprising who have attempted to arouse sympathy for the three guilty scouts by pointing out that while one had attained the rank of eagle scout the other two were only tenderfoots,but what of the two tenderfoots they ask,roth
8977,8978,how could two little tenderfoots pose so serious a threat to our national security as to make it necessary to kill them,well let me answer that question my fellow americans by showing you the weapons that were found concealed hanging from the belts of these two little tenderfoot scouts when their bodies were searched by the fbi the secret service the cia the military police the shore patrol the attorney general s office the capitol police force the police force of the district of columbia as well as by law enforcement officers summoned from around the country to guarantee the probity and thoroughness of this investigation,roth
8979,8980,now i am sure that we all still remember with a sad and mournful heart the italian carbine rifle purchased for from a chicago mailorder house by president charisma s assassin lee harvey oswald whom i mentioned earlier in connection with james earl ray and charles curtis flood,in the mailorder catalog that rifle probably did not appear to be any more sophisticated than the weapon i am about to show you now or any more capable of changing the course of history,roth
8981,8982,but let there be no mistake about it it is just as effective if not more so,firstly whereas the rifle that destroyed president charisma s political career measured forty inches overall this knife that i hold here in my hand measures with the blades sheathed only four and fiveeighths inches,roth
8983,8984,this makes it an ideal weapon to use in public places as opposed to a fortyinch rifle which might arouse suspicion on a school bus or in a supermarket or any of the hundred places where you and your loved ones find yourselves in the course of an ordinary day,secondly it is a far more vicious weapon than an ordinary rifle and needless to say does not even begin to approach in humaneness a simple thousandpound bomb let alone a nuclear ex plosive,roth
8985,8986,as one who was raised as a quaker you know i have a particularly strong interest in being humane,that is why since coming to office i have done everything i can to get congress to appropriate money for a weapons system that would make us number one in the world in that department,roth
8987,8988,now that is the type of death people have dreamed about for themselves since time immemorial and let it not be recorded that trick e dixon lacked the moral and spiritual idealism to address himself to that dream,but now let me ask you this my fellow americans,roth
8989,8990,what could be further from the kind of painless death for men everywhere that this administration is working so hard to bring about than that which is experienced by the victim of a knife such as i am holding in my hand,not only is it necessary to deliver as many as five to ten horrifyingly painful stab wounds in order to kill somebody with a weapon this small but in order to accomplish this the murderer must exhibit a sustained viciousness a coldblooded determination to kill that i assure you would shock and appall a combattried bomber pilot no less than it does you and me,roth
8991,8992,why else would they use a weapon that takes up to half an hour to do the sort of job our pilots accomplish in a split second and without the groaning and the gore,now let s look at the knife closely,roth
8993,8994,am going to open out the blades one by one and describe to you the purpose and function of each,you should not be misled by its fourandfiveeighthsinch exterior into imagining that it is simply an instrument designed to kill,roth
8995,8996,like so many of the weapons carried by guerrilla revolutionaries around the world it has multiple uses of which murder of the agonizing and sadistic variety is but one,let s begin here with the smallest of the four blades,roth
8997,8998,in the language of those who employ such weapons it is known as the bottle opener,i ll tell you how it got that name in a moment,roth
8999,9000,you will observe that it is hookshaped at the end and measures one inch and oneeighth,it is employed during the interrogation of prisoners primarily to gouge out one or both of the eyes,roth
9001,9002,last but not least it is sometimes inserted into the mouth of a prisoner who will not talk in order to slit the flesh at the upper part of the larynx between the vocal cords,that opening up there is called the glottis and bottle opener is derived from glottal opener the pet name originally attached to the blade by its most coldblooded practitioners,roth
9003,9004,this second largest blade measuring one inch and threequarters tapers to a point and probably looks to you to be a miniature bayonet,do not be fooled by appearances,roth
9005,9006,it has nothing to do with bayonets such as those our brave soldiers found it necessary to fix to their rifles in selfdefense during the twoday boy scout uprising,this little blade is known as the leather punch and far from being an instrument of selfdefense it is yet another torture device along the lines of the bottle opener,roth
9007,9008,as its name suggests it is used to punch holes in human flesh or leather as the flesh is called by revolutionaries who consider their enemies to be no more than animals,it will come as no surprise to you to learn that it is most frequently driven into the palms of the hands much the same way that the nails were in the movie the greatest story ever told,roth
9009,9010,it is known as the screwdriver,traditionally it is inserted into the groove between the nails and the flesh and turned in a rotary fashion like so,roth
9011,9012,however we know from intelligence reports that the screwdriver may also on occasion be introduced into bodily apertures of which the nostrils and the ears are the only ones i shall choose to make mention of on nationwide television,some of my political opponents may think otherwiseand they have every right to disagree with my positionbut i for one have never believed it necessary to use bad language to make my point and i have no intention of resorting to those kinds of tactics in the midst of a major address to the nation,roth
9013,9014,this last blade of the four is probably the one you re most familiar with from your nightmares,two inches and threequarters in length ninesixteenths of an inch at its widest point it has a sharp cutting edge that i shall demonstrate for you on this piece of paper,roth
9015,9016,incidentally it is no accident that printed on this piece of paper is the preamble to the constitution the bill of rights and the oftquoted and much beloved ten commandments with their famous thou shalt nots,i do nt think i am too far afield when i say that what you see printed on this sheet of paper closeup of paper is just about everything we believe in and cherish as a people,roth
9017,9018,i want you to watch as i demonstrate what this blade can do in a matter of seconds to all that you and i hold near and dear,he slices the piece of paper into oneinch strips and then holds them up for the audience to see of course you can peel apples with a blade like this you can slice your potatoes for frying and you can cut up your cucumbers radishes tomatoes onions and celery for salad,roth
9019,9020,and i am sure that those who would seek to exonerate these three scouts will maintain that it was only to prepare a delicious salad such as i described that they secreted these weapons upon their belts and carried them hundreds of miles across state lines to the nation s capital,i am afraid that whether it is knifecarrying boy scouts or cardcarrying communists there will always be a handful of apologists around to come to their defense,roth
9021,9022,my fellow americans i want to leave it to you and not to the apologists to decide,i ask you to look at this fourpronged instrument of torture,roth
9023,9024,i ask you to look at what just one of those blades was able to do to the preamble to the constitution the bill of rights and the beloved ten commandments,and now i ask you if you think there is anything at all to be said in defense of three boy scouts carrying such knives into the nation s capital,roth
9025,9026,and incidentally in that connection these were not the only three boy scouts in washington bearing concealed weapons on their belts,these were only the three we happened to kill,roth
9027,9028,in all a total of eight thousand four hundred and sixtythree knives each resembling this one in every last detail were confiscated during the two days the scouts were here,that means a grand total of thirtythree thousand eight hundred and fiftytwo blades or enough blades to torture simultaneously every single resident of chevy chase maryland including women and children,roth
9029,9030,now you ask how did we prevent this bloodbath from taking place in chevy chase,the answer is by setting up an enclosed camping site for the scouts who were not shot,roth
9031,9032,and let me tell you something it is to the very great credit of the scouting movement in this country that once we were able to get these boys off the streets and into a rugged camping situationand we have the police to thank for volunteering their help in getting all the boys out therethey showed themselves worthy in every way of their famous motto be prepared,let s take a look at just a few of their accomplishments first in the absence of toilet facilities they did a tremendous job in disposing of their waste matter and the leaves they used for personal hygiene,roth
9033,9034,next what little water they had in their canteens they shared in an admirable way or so it would seem from the fact that not a single one of the nearly ten thousand died of thirst,nor did they make the mistake of drinking from or even daring to bathe in the pond at the campsite,roth
9035,9036,so familiar were they with the danger signs of sewage and stagnation,as for eating well i m proud to say that by morning they had discovered edible roots and berries we did nt even know were there,roth
9037,9038,and as for warmth as you could expect they managed during the night to start several fires in the classic boy scout manner of rubbing two sticks together,in all what might have been a nightmare for the citizens of chevy chase maryland was converted into wonderful scouting experience for the boys themselves and one that i m sure they ll remember for a long time to come,roth
9039,9040,i know that when the police vans returned this morning to take them away many of the boys were reluctant to leave the campsite,so anxious were some to spend another night under the stars and away from the socalled comforts of civilization such as medical attention lawyers telephones and food that it was necessary for the police to chase after them and literally drag them off the premises and into the waiting trucks,roth
9041,9042,with fewer and fewer opportunities available to our youth for roughing it this administration naturally takes pride in what we were able to do for these youngsters last night,now i know that many of you out there across the country are asking yourselves why i should be making such a generous offer to the scouts,roth
9043,9044,why do i praise them for their behavior at the campsite,why am i willing to forgive these youngsters and give them another chance to make a decent start in life,roth
9045,9046,it must seem to those of you who saw the scouts waving their signs here in the streets of the nation s capitalsigns offensive and insulting not only to me but what is far worse to my innocent familythat i more than anyone have a right to harbor a grievance against these ten thousand boy scouts and particularly against the three who are now dead and will never be able to come to me like responsible children and apologize for trying to smear my reputation,why you may ask am i so compassionate judicious charitable tolerant and wise when it was my very own political career that stood to be most damaged by these signs,roth
9047,9048,well those are good and intelligent questions,let me try to answer them as forthrightly as i know how,roth
9049,9050,oh sure somebody else might try to make political capital out of a vendetta against these youngsters calling them hoodlums and bums and rotten apples but i am afraid i am just too big a man for that,as far as i am concerned these boys have learned their lesson as they proved at the campsite and that goes for the three dead scouts as well,roth
9051,9052,even if those three dead boys do nt come and apologize as far as i am concerned the past is past and i for one am willing to forgive and forget,for make no mistake about it while it is true that i am strongly opposed to permissiveness i am just as opposed to vindictiveness,roth
9053,9054,i no more believe in punishing a wrongdoer to excess than i would subscribe to the liberal philosophy that allows a criminal to go merrily on his way after he has committed a crime,but of even greater importance i just do nt think we ever cure a disease by treating one of its symptoms,roth
9055,9056,rather we must get to the cause of the illness,and certainly you know as well as i do that the cause of america s problems is not the boy scouts of america,roth
9057,9058,nobody is ever going to believe that and that is why i do nt even attempt to make a case for it,they are just another group of american youngsters who have fallen prey to that small dedicated band of malcontents and revolutionaries who are out to destroy our country by destroying our most important natural resource of all our wonderful youth,roth
9059,9060,and unless we cut these sources of contagion from our society as swiftly and thoroughly as we would excise a cancer from a living bodyand i know we are all united in our opposition to cancer democrats and republicans alikethis disease that has spread even to the boy scouts will grow in virulence until it has infected every last child in the land including your own,and so long as i am president i am not going to stand idly by while the children of this country come down with cancer leukemia or incidentally in that connection muscular dystrophy,roth
9061,9062,no it is not the boy scouts of america but the man who incited them to this riot by tampering with their morals who must be made to take the punishment that comes to all who would corrupt the youth of our nation,and that man my fellow americans is the very same fugitive for whom the propornography government in copenhagen is providing refuge at this moment,roth
9063,9064,we all know however the tremendous influence that major league baseball players have over the minds and hearts of the young boys of this nation,i am sure that anyone who remembers how he himself idolized the great ballplayers of his youth will not even need the evidence in order to imagine just how charles curtis flood might misuse and mislead these boys for his own subversive ends,roth
9065,9066,i am afraid that is all i can say to you tonight about the evidence proving flood s guilt,as one who has practiced law i am particularly sensitive to the constitutional rights which every defendant is entitled to,roth
9067,9068,and i certainly do not intend to endanger the chances of a conviction by appearing to try this fugitive on nationwide tv,once he is returned to america he will be entitled to a fair trial despite what he has done and by a jury that has not been prejudiced against him by so august a person as the president of the united states of america,roth
9069,9070,right now as your president my duty is to do everything within my power to see that this fugitive from justice is returned to our shores,of course we have never expected of flood that he would voluntarily leave his sanctuary in denmark given the kinds of pleasures such a man might feel free to pursue in a country with customs that are hardly those of our own,roth
9071,9072,on the contrary they have rejected out of hand every legitimate request we have made of them,even now with the american army massed on their borders the american navy blockading their coast and the american marines firmly in control of hamlet s castle they continue to provide him with the same protection from the law that they provide to pornographers and filth peddlers from around the globe,roth
9073,9074,i know that in the face of such profound contempt for american power and prestige the great majority of americans would agree that i have no choice but to order our troops onto danish soil so as to establish the dar,as the freely elected government in copenhagen,roth
9075,9076,however i want to tell you this because of my quaker background i have only two hours ago made one last valiant effort to bring about a peaceful resolution of our differences with denmark,i am going to conclude my address to you tonight by recounting in some detail the nature of that effort,roth
9077,9078,it is a story of bravery and devotion to country that every american will be proud of,my fellow americans only two hours before coming on television to address you i gave the order as commanderinchief of the armed forces meeting his responsibilities for a fleet of helicopters to make a surprise landing on the large danish island of zealand at a spot right here points only twenty nautical miles from the capital of copenhagen,roth
9079,9080,now i realized how dangerous such a gallant humanitarian effort might be,so did the brave green berets and rangers who volunteered to carry it out,roth
9081,9082,not only would they have to fly in at treetop level to avoid detection by the danish radar system but there was no precise way of telling the exact size of the arsenal that flood had managed to assemble with the approval if not the outright assistance of the danish government,would he resort to poison gas,roth
9083,9084,would he dare to employ tactical nuclear weapons,there was no way in which our aerial photography could penetrate this man s skull to see just how far he would go in violating the written and unwritten rules of warfare,roth
9085,9086,designed to capture flood remove him by helicopter to elsinore and hence by military jet to america the mission was named by me operation courage and assigned to joint contingency task force derringdo,it is with deep pride my fellow americans that i can now tell you that operation courage has been carried out to perfection exactly in accordance with the meticulously rehearsed schedule drawn up beforehand,roth
9087,9088,first off the dangerous flight from elsinore to the landing site was made in twentytwo minutes and fourteen seconds precisely according to the plan,next the hazardous search of the farmhouse the outbuildings and the tilled acreage was accomplished in thirtyfour minutes and eighteen seconds in other words with two full seconds to spare,roth
9089,9090,the ticklish evacuation proceedings required precisely the seven minutes called for in the schedule and the daring return flight to elsinore at treetop level was accomplished in twentytwo minutes flat,moreover our forces returned to safety without sustaining a single casualty,roth
9091,9092,as at elsinore the enemy was so completely taken by surprise that they did not fire a single shot,i am proud to tell you that the intelligence on operation courage was equally as impressive as the splitsecond timing with which this perilous mission was accomplished,roth
9093,9094,first the seven blondhaired females who were identified on the aerial photos moving in and out of the farmhouse at all hours of the day were present at the time of the landing,they were found as expected in beds scattered throughout the house and taken immediately into custody for interrogation by the green berets as was the couple claiming to be their father and mother,roth
9095,9096,the blondhaired females found in the beds in various stages of undress ranged in age from seven to eighteen,second the dark round objects visible in the aerial photographs and identified positively by intelligence as watermelons were no longer in the field or patch at the time of the landing nor was there evidence any longer of the watermelon vines themselves,roth
9097,9098,this has led intelligence to conclude that only hours before the raid the telltale watermelons were removed and replaced with the ordinary rocks and potato plants found at the time of the landing,as for the large dark object identified as charles curtis flood himself apparently at the very last minute he too was replaced with a big black labrador dog,roth
9099,9100,this was verified when the dog was found romping in the very fields where photographs taken the previous night revealed the fugitive exercising by moonlight,it is to the great credit of the commander in charge of operation courageand represents the highest order of dedication and professionalismthat in order to keep faithfully to the plan the dog was taken into custody in precisely the same amount of time as had been allotted for the capture of flood,roth
9101,9102,she was then transported in the command helicopter bound and under heavy guard to hamlet s castle at elsinore,however once the helicopters touched safely clown i immediately gave the order from the white house that the interrogation of the dog was to be suspended and that she was to be released from her bindings and allowed to roam on a leash in a grassy enclosure on the castle grounds,roth
9103,9104,now it had been my hope that i could come before you tonight to tell you that flood was in the custody of american officials and that it would not be necessary to take further measures against a recalcitrant and contemptuous danish government in order to secure his release,and make no mistake about it,roth
9105,9106,if we were not dealing with a man so vicious that he would rather risk the life of an innocent female dog than his own i could have done just that,however even though they were unable to apprehend the fugitive at this time i should still like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the skill courage and devotion with which joint contingency task force derringdo carried out operation courage,roth
9107,9108,the flawless fashion in which they executed this delicate secret mission was inspirational to all americans,and surely it must be accounted the most successful single operation of its kind staged thus far in the danish crisis,roth
9109,9110,the embarrassment alone that we have caused copenhagen by pointing up the holes in their radar system will inevitably have a profound effect upon the morale of the danish people and their armed forces,yes they were written with a quill pen on a piece of parchment hundreds and hundreds of years ago but probably never have they been so true as they are tonight,roth
9111,9112,little did the immortal bard know then how prophetic those words would be in the centuries to come,my fellow americans here tricky rises from his chair to sit on the edge of his desk something is rotten in denmarklet there be no mistake about it,roth
9113,9114,and if it has now fallen to american boys to step in and eradicate the rottenness that danish boys are unable to step in and eradicate i know they will not hesitate to do so,makes fist because we will not watch as the oncegreat homeland of hamlet slips down the drain of depravity,roth
9115,9116,looks down instead with all the might that we can summon in our righteous cause we shall quick friendly glance at ceiling with god s help purge denmark of corruption now and for all time,looks for a moment into eternity without batting eyelashes thank you and good night,roth
9117,9118,my fellow americans i am going to conclude my address with the words of a very great man,we repeat this bulletin,roth
9119,9120,trick e dixon is dead,that is all the information we have at this time,roth
9121,9122,the white house has refused to comment on an earlier bulletin announcing that the president of the united states is dead,the white house bilge secretary says there is no truth whatsoever to reports of the president s death but adds that he will not categorically deny the story at this time,roth
9123,9124,conflicting stories continue to circulate concerning the death of the president,a second white house announcement has now called attention to the president s schedule for the day pointing out that no mention is made there of dying,roth
9125,9126,i think it would be best said the white house bilge secretary in the light of these schedules to wait for a statement one way or another from the president himself,reports out of walter reed army hospital now seem to confirm the earlier bulletin that the president of the united states is dead,roth
9127,9128,though the circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear it appears that the president was admitted to walter reed late yesterday for surgery,the purpose of the secret operation was to remove the sweat glands from his hip,roth
9129,9130,that is all we know at this time,the vice president has flatly denied reports of the president s death,roth
9131,9132,here is a portion of the vice president s remarks made as he was on his way to address the national yodeling association now this is just the kind of reckless rot and rotten recklessness that you can expect from the vile vilifiers who are out to vilify vilely,what of the reports mr,roth
9133,9134,vice president that he had secretly entered walter reed last night to have the sweat glands removed from his hip,hogwash and hokum,roth
9135,9136,and hooliganism,and heinous,roth
9137,9138,i spoke to him only five minutes ago and found him fit as a fiddle,this lachrymose lie is a lamentable lollapalooza launched by the lunatic left,roth
9139,9140,unconfirmed reports from walter reed hospital now indicate that the president was found dead at seven am,this morning,roth
9141,9142,no word yet on the cause of death or where he was found,speculation mounts that death came following surgery for the removal of sweat glands lodged in the hip,roth
9143,9144,then you are admitting sir that he is dead,i did nt say that at all,roth
9145,9146,i said i just do nt think that his death if it were to come about between now and the election would affect his popularity with the great majority of americans,after all this is nt the first time you people were ready to call him dead and here he is president of the united states,roth
9147,9148,but we meant dead politically,all i m saying is that whether these rumors are true or false is not going to affect our campaign plans by one iota,roth
9149,9150,i d even go so far as to say that if it turns out he actually is a corpse our margin of victory in will be greater by far than what it was in,how do you figure that mr,roth
9151,9152,chairman,well i for one just can not imagine the press of this country irresponsible and vicious as it may be going after this man dead and buried with the same kind of virulence they used to go after him alive,roth
9153,9154,furthermore as regards the voters themselves it would seem to me that there is a certain sympathy a certain warmth that a dead dixon is going to be able to arouse in the people of this country that he never really was able to summon up when he was living and breathing and so on,if he is dead then you think it would be good for his image,roth
9155,9156,no doubt about it,i think that in terms of exposure he may have gone about as far as he can alive,roth
9157,9158,this is probably just the shot in the arm we ve been looking for particularly if the democrats run teddy charisma,can you explain what you mean mr,roth
9159,9160,chairman,it s one thing you see for a candidate for the presidency to have two brothers who are deadit s something else when the incumbent himself is dead,roth
9161,9162,i mean if experience is any kind of criterionand i think it isi just do nt see how you can top the president now where this whole death issue is concerned,mr,roth
9163,9164,chairman is there any truth at all to the growing suspicion that you people are sending up a trial balloon with these rumors of the president s death,to see just how much political mileage there is in it if any,roth
9165,9166,that is on the one hand you yourself sound convinced that the president s death would give a great boost to his waning popularity while vice president whatshisname asserts that the president is fit as a fiddle and that these rumors have been propagated by the lunatic left,look i have no intention of criticizing the alliteration of the vice president of the united states of america,roth
9167,9168,under the constitution he has a right to alliterate just as much as any other american citizen,i am speaking to you boys strictly as party chairman and all i am saying in language plain and simple is that the president has absolutely no intention of withdrawing from the race for any reason whatsoever including his own death,roth
9169,9170,this is nt a lyin b johnson who tosses in the towel because the country hates his guts and does nt trust him as far as they can throw him,no you re not going to intimidate trick e dixon just by hating him,roth
9171,9172,hell he s had that all his life he s used to it,and you re not going to keep him off the ballot by killing him either,roth
9173,9174,if he has to address that convention from inside an urn he ll do itthat s the kind of dedicated american we re talking about,the white house has now issued a statement denyingi repeat denyingthat the president entered walter reed hospital yesterday for the removal of the sweat glands from his hip,roth
9175,9176,there continues however to be a total news blackout from that source as to whether president dixon is dead or alive,it seems now that the president did enter the hospital late yesterday for a secret operation,roth
9177,9178,first reports had it that the operation was to have been on his hip for the surgical removal of sweat glands apparently lodged in that area,however the white house as you know has flatly denied that story and only a moment ago i learned the reason why,roth
9179,9180,the operation was to have been not on the chief executive s hip but on his lip lip,the sweat glands were from all reports to have been removed from the lip this morning,roth
9181,9182,but now according to the latest white house communique surgery has been postponed for the time being because of and i quote an unforeseen development,according to highly placed sources within the hospital itself that unforeseen development is the death of the president of the united states,roth
9183,9184,now i see that the secretary of defense has just emerged from the hospital and is walking this way,secretary lard have you just come from the president s side,roth
9185,9186,yes,you seem quite despondent sir,roth
9187,9188,can you tell us if he is dead or alive,unconfirmed reports from various sources say he was found dead at seven am,roth
9189,9190,this morning,can you tell us then why you were visiting him,roth
9191,9192,to find out his secret timetable for ending the war,is there anybody other than the president who knows the secret timetable,roth
9193,9194,of course not,then if he s dead he s taken the secret time table with him to the grave,roth
9195,9196,no comment,secretary lard did the president have any other visitors aside from yourself,roth
9197,9198,yes,the joint chiefs,roth
9199,9200,and of course the professor,and they do nt know the secret timetable either,roth
9201,9202,i told you nobody knows it but him,that s what makes it secret,roth
9203,9204,not even his wife,well actually she thought she had it when we called her this morning,roth
9205,9206,but it was just an old train schedule between washington and new york,she found it in one of his suits,roth
9207,9208,there s no other place he might have left it,it does nt seem like it,roth
9209,9210,cut open the mattresses did you,oh all of that,roth
9211,9212,ripped up floors,tore out paneling,roth
9213,9214,turned the place inside out,no sign of anything resembling a secret timetable,roth
9215,9216,mr,secretary everything you say seems to confirm the rumor that the president is dead,roth
9217,9218,if that is the case what were you and the joint chiefs and the professors doing sitting around a corpse trying to find out vital information,well we also had a medium with us,roth
9219,9220,a medium,oh do nt worry,roth
9221,9222,she s worked for us before,highest security clearance,roth
9223,9224,topflight gypsy,and did she get through to the president,roth
9225,9226,i believe i can say she did,how do you know,roth
9227,9228,well she got through to a voice who kept saying he was a quaker,and what about the secret timetable,roth
9229,9230,he says a secret is a secret and he owes it to the american people who have placed their confidence in him not to betray a sacred trust,he said they can brand and skewer him in hell he s never going to tell a soul,roth
9231,9232,honest almost to a fault,well he had to be you know with that sweating problem,roth
9233,9234,otherwise people tended not always to believe everything he said,as you saw he was distraught and very near to tears throughout the interview thus appearing to confirm the reports of the president s death,roth
9235,9236,we return you to the vice president who is now addressing the national sword swallowers association,no doubt about it,roth
9237,9238,here are the four blades,count em,roth
9239,9240,one two three four,openandshut case,roth
9241,9242,and this is the one,this is the murder weapon no doubt about it,roth
9243,9244,then the president has been murdered,i ca nt tell you that right now,roth
9245,9246,but i can assure you that if there has been a murder this is what did it,and do you have the murderer in custody,roth
9247,9248,one thing at a time,you rush in and say you ve got the murderer everybody thinks you picked up the first guy you could find out on the street,roth
9249,9250,let s at least get the announcement of a murder before we start accusing people,how about the kind of murder,roth
9251,9252,stabbed to death,well there again it s like have you stopped beating your wife,roth
9253,9254,but of course i will say this much with a knife you may very well find that the victim has been stabbed to death yes,of course there are other possibilities as well and i can assure you we re looking into them thoroughly,roth
9255,9256,for instance,well you ve got your bludgeoning of course,roth
9257,9258,you ve got your various forms of torture such as the president himself outlined on tv the other night,in other words it s possible the president s famous eyes may have been gouged out,roth
9259,9260,i would nt rule that out at this time no,but by whom,roth
9261,9262,how,when,roth
9263,9264,where,look as we say here at the bureau ask me no questions and i ll tell you no lies,roth
9265,9266,we just do nt intend to come in for the sort of criticism on this assassination of a president that we did on the last one,what sort of criticism do you mean,roth
9267,9268,well last time there was just some kind of cloud over the whole thing was nt there,credibility gap and so on,roth
9269,9270,people thinking they were nt getting the straight story,accusing us of covering up and being caught off guard and so on,roth
9271,9272,well this time it s going to be different i can assure you,this time we have the weapon and a fairly good idea of who did it beforehand and we re really only waiting for word that it actually happened to make an arrest,roth
9273,9274,after a decent interval of course just so it does nt look as though we picked up the first poor slob we found in the gutter,is it a boy scout,roth
9275,9276,that is will it be a boy seout if and when,well of course i am only a law enforcement officer,roth
9277,9278,i do nt decide who commits the crimes i just catch them after that decision has been made by the proper authorities,i will say this however,roth
9279,9280,that was one of the troubles with the last assassination did nt have a good strong motive to go with it,after all we are talking about the assassination of the highest elected officer in the land,roth
9281,9282,people like a good strong motive when something like that happens and i ca nt say that i blame them,that s why this time we intend to give it to them,roth
9283,9284,otherwise you re just going to get your national disunity your credibility gap your doubt and your cloud over the whole thing,and you honestly think that this boy scout knife will clear up such doubt and incredulity,roth
9285,9286,why,do nt you,roth
9287,9288,well it s not for me to say,i m just an objective reporter,roth
9289,9290,no no go ahead say,what do you think,roth
9291,9292,just because you re objective does nt necessarily make you a fool,you do nt find the boy scout knife convincing,roth
9293,9294,is that it,but what i think is nt at issueeither this is or is not the murder weapon,roth
9295,9296,in other words you re implying that it does seem to you farfetched,good enough,roth
9297,9298,what would you think of this then,that,roth
9299,9300,yes sira louisville slugger,curt flood s very own baseball bat,roth
9301,9302,let me show you on this model here of the president s head the kind of damage you can do with one of these things,well watch this,roth
9303,9304,to the white house now for an important announcement by the president s bilge secretary,ladies and gentlemen i d like to make the following announcement concerning the president s health,roth
9305,9306,at midnight last night the president entered walter reed army hospital for minor surgery involving the surgical removal of the sweat glands from his upper lip,can you spell that blurb,roth
9307,9308,lip,lip,roth
9309,9310,and the first word,upper,roth
9311,9312,upper now as you know the president has always wanted to do everything he could to gain the trust and the confidence and if it was within the realm of possibility the affection of the american people,it was his belief that if he could stop sweating so much along his upper lip when he addressed the nation the great majority of the american people would come to believe he was an honest man speaking the truth and maybe even like him a little better,roth
9313,9314,now this is not to say that people who sweat along the upper lip are necessarily liars andor unlikable,then too there are a lot of good hardworking ordinary citizens who simply sweat along the upper lip as a matter of course that is really all i have to say to you at this hour ladies and gentlemen,roth
9315,9316,i would nt have bothered to call you together like this had it not been for the continuing rumors that it was the president s hip that had required surgery,there is absolutely no truth to that whatsoever and i wanted you to be the first to know,roth
9317,9318,i hope by tomorrow in fact to have available for you xray photos of the president s hip that will make it absolutely clear that it is in perfect condition,which hip will that be blurb,roth
9319,9320,the left hip,what about the right one,roth
9321,9322,we ll try to get those to you within the week,i assure you that we re working to clear this thing up just as fast as we can,roth
9323,9324,we do nt want the people in this country to go around thinking the president has something wrong with his hips any more than you do,what about the reports that he s dead blurb,roth
9325,9326,i have nothing to say about that at this time,but secretary lard was seen weeping as he left walter reed today,roth
9327,9328,surely that suggests that president dixon is dead,not necessarily,roth
9329,9330,i m not going to speculate either way gentlemen in a matter this serious,what about reports that he s been murdered by a boy scout gone berserk,roth
9331,9332,we re looking into that and if there s any truth at all to that story i assure you we ll be in touch with you about it,can you say anything definite about his condition at all,roth
9333,9334,he s resting comfortably,are the sweat glands out,roth
9335,9336,and if so can we see them,no comment,roth
9337,9338,moreover it would really be up to the first lady anyway whether she wanted the president s sweat glands to be made available for photographers and so on,i think she might want to keep something as personal as those glands just for the immediate family and maybe eventually build a trick e dixon library at prissier in which to house them,roth
9339,9340,can you tell us how big they are blurp,well i would imagine that given the sheer amount of sweating he used to do they were pretty goodsized,roth
9341,9342,but i m only guessing,i have nt seen them,roth
9343,9344,blurb is there any truth to the report that while at walter reed he was also going to have surgery done to prevent his eyes from shifting,no comment,roth
9345,9346,does that mean they were gouged out,will the eyes be in the trick e dixon library at prissier too blurb,roth
9347,9348,once again that would be entirely up to the first lady,blurb what about his gestures,roth
9349,9350,he s been criticized for a certain unnaturalness or falseness in his gestures,they do nt always seem tied in to what he s saying,roth
9351,9352,if he s still alive are there any plans for him to have that fixed too,and if so how,roth
9353,9354,can they sort of get him synchronized in that department,gentlemen i m sure the doctors are going to do everything they can to make him appear as honest as possible,roth
9355,9356,one last question blurb,if he s dead that would make mr,roth
9357,9358,whatshisname the president,is there any truth to the rumor that you people are postponing the announcement of dixon s death because you re looking for a lastminute replacement for whatshisname,roth
9359,9360,is that why mr,whatshisname himself keeps denying so vehemently the reports that the president is deadfor fear of being dumped,roth
9361,9362,gentlemen i think you know as well as i do that the vice president is not the kind of man who would want to be president of the united states if he felt there was any doubt as to his qualifications for the office,that s f of even a question i will take seriously,roth
9363,9364,this is erect severehead with a cogent news analysis from the nation s capital a hushed hush pervades the corridors of power,great men whisper whispers while a stunned capital awaits,roth
9365,9366,even the cherry blossoms along the potomac seem to sense the magnitude,and magnitude there is,roth
9367,9368,yet magnitude there has been before and the nation has survived,a mood of cautious optimism surged forward just at dusk,roth
9369,9370,then set the ageold sun behind these edifices of reason and gloom once more descended,yet gloom there has been and in the end the nation has survived,roth
9371,9372,for the principles are everlasting though the men be mortal,and it is that very mortality that the men in the corridors of power demonstrate,roth
9373,9374,for no one dares to play politics with the momentousness of a tragedy of such scope or the scope of a tragedy of such momentousness,if tragedy it be,roth
9375,9376,yet tragedies there have been and the nation founded upon hope and trust in man and the deity has continued to survive,still in this worried capital tonight men watch and men wait,roth
9377,9378,so too do women and children in this worried capital tonight watch and wait,this is erect severehead from washington dc,roth
9379,9380,a troop of boy scouts from boston massachusetts the home state of senator edward charisma has confessed to the murder of the president of the united states,the fbi has declined to give their names until such time as the president s murder has been announced by the white house,roth
9381,9382,the boy scouts are being held without bail and according to the fbi the case is quote cinched unquote,the murder weapon which at first was believed to be the very knife that the president had exhibited on television during his famous something is rotten in denmark speech is now identified as a louisville slugger baseball bat formerly the property of washington senator center fielder curt flood,roth
9383,9384,the president of the united states was assassinated sometime in the early hours of the morning,the cause of death was drowning,roth
9385,9386,he was found at seven am unclothed and bent into the fetal position inside a large transparent baggie filled with a clear fluid presumed to be water and tied shut at the top,the baggie containing the body of the president was found on the floor of the hospital delivery room,roth
9387,9388,how he was removed from his own room where he was awaiting surgery on his upper lip and forced or enticed into a baggie is not known at this time,there would seem to be little doubt however that the manner in which he has been murdered is directly related to the controversial remarks he made at san dementia on april in which he came out foursquare for the rights of the unborn,roth
9389,9390,right now hospital officials seem to believe that the president left his bed voluntarily to accompany his assailant to the delivery room perhaps in the belief that he was to be photographed there beside the stomach of a woman in labor,doubtless with the destruction of copenhagen and the occupation of denmark successfully accomplished he was anxious to return to what he considered our most pressing domestic problem,roth
9391,9392,rumor has it that he intended in his next major address to use his new upper lip to outline his belief in the sanctity of human life including the life of the yet unborn,but now there will be no speech on the sanctity of human life with the new lip he would have been so proud of,roth
9393,9394,a cruel assassin with a macabre sense of humor has seen to that,the man who believed in the unborn is dead his unclothed body found stuffed in the fetal position inside a waterfilled baggie on the floor of the delivery room here at walter reed hospital,roth
9395,9396,this is roger occasion at walter reed,quickly now to the white house and the latest bulletin from the bilge secretary,roth
9397,9398,ladies and gentlemen i have a few more facts for you now about the president s hip including the xray i promised earlier,this gentleman in white that you see beside me in his surgical gloves gown and mask is probably the foremost authority on the lefthip in the world,roth
9399,9400,doctor will you comment on this xray of the president s left hip for the members of the press,i ll hold it for you so you do nt dirty your gloves,roth
9401,9402,thank you blurb,ladies and gentlemen there is just no doubt about it in my mind,roth
9403,9404,this is a left hip,thank you doctor,roth
9405,9406,any questions,blurb the report from walter reed is that the president has been assassinated,roth
9407,9408,stuffed naked into a baggie and drowned,gentlemen let s try to keep to the subject,roth
9409,9410,the doctor here has flown in from minnesota right in the middle of an operation on a left hip to verify this xray for you,i do nt think we want to keep him longer than we have to,roth
9411,9412,yes,doctor can you be absolutely sure that the left hip is the president s,roth
9413,9414,of course i can,how sir,roth
9415,9416,because that s what the bilge secretary said it was,why would he give me a picture of a hip and say it was the president s if it was nt,roth
9417,9418,so stunned are the people of this great middle western metropolis that they seem totally unable to respond to the bulletins from washington that have come to them over radio and television,and so from the gold coast to skid row from the fashionable suburbs of the north to the squalid ghettos of the south the scene is much the same people going about their ordinary everyday affairs as though nothing had happened,roth
9419,9420,not even the flags have been lowered to halfstaff but continue to flutter high in the breeze even as they did before the news reached this griefstricken city of the terrible fate that has befallen our leader,trick e dixon is dead cruelly and bizarrely murdered a martyr to the unborn the world roundand it is more than the mind or spirit of chicago can accept or understand,roth
9421,9422,and so throughout this great city life in a manner of speaking goes onmuch as you see it directly behind me here in the worldfamous loop,shoppers rushing to and fro,roth
9423,9424,the din of traffic continuous,restaurants jammed,roth
9425,9426,streetcars and busses packed,yes the frantic mindless scurrying of a big city at the rush hour,roth
9427,9428,this is morton momentous from a stunned incredulous chicago,we take you now to los angeles and correspondent peter pious,roth
9429,9430,if the people in the streets of chicago are incredulous you can well imagine the mood of the ordinary man in the pool here in trick e dixon s native state,in chicago they are simply unable to respond here it is even more heartrending,roth
9431,9432,the californians i have spoken withor tried to speak withare like nothing so much as small children who have been confronted with an event far beyond their emotional range of response,all they can do when they learn the tragic news that trick e dixon has been found stuffed in a baggie is giggle,roth
9433,9434,to be sure there are the proverbial california wisecracks but by and large it is giggling such as one might hear from perplexed and bewildered children that remains in one s ears long after the giggler himself has lived off the high board or driven away in his sports car,here he is not just the president here he is a friend and a neighbor one of them a healthy child of the sunlight of the beaches and the blue pacific a wan who embodied all the robustness and grandeur of america s golden state,roth
9435,9436,peter pious in los angeles,next ike ironic in new york city,roth
9437,9438,no one ever believed that trick e dixon was beloved in new york city,yes he lived here once in this fashionable fifth avenue apartment building directly behind me,roth
9439,9440,but few ever considered him a resident of this city so much as a refugee from washington biding his time to return to public office,nor did new yorkers seem much impressed when he assumed the powers of the presidency in,roth
9441,9442,but now he is gone and all at once the very deep affection the love if you will for their former neighbor is everywhere apparent,of course you have to know new yorkers to be able to penetrate the outer shell of cynicism and see the love beneath,roth
9443,9444,you had to look but you saw it today here in new york in the seeming boredom and indifference of a bus driver in the impatience of a salesgirl in the anger over nothing of a taxi driver in the weariness of the homebound workers packed into the subway in the blank gaze of the drunks along the bowery in the haughtiness of a dowager refusing to curb her dog on the fashionable upper east side,you had to look but there it was love for trick e dixon,roth
9445,9446,yes the bitter irony is this he had to die in a baggie before new yorkers could tender him that hardwon love that would have meant so much to him,but then it is a day of bitter ironies,roth
9447,9448,ike ironic from griefstricken and perhaps guiltridden fifth avenue in the city of new york where he lived like a stranger but has died like a longlost son,no the ordinary signs of grief are clearly not sufficient to express the emotion that they feel at this hour and so they pretend for the time being that it simply has not happened or they giggle with embarrassment and disbelief or they attempt to hide beneath a gruff exterior the deep love for a fallen leader that smolders away within,roth
9449,9450,and what of the madman who perpetrated this deed,for that story we return you to the headquarters of the fbi in washington,roth
9451,9452,that s right we re pretty sure now it was a madman who perpetrated this deed,and the scouts,roth
9453,9454,the knife,the louisville slugger,roth
9455,9456,i m talking now about the brains behind the whole thing,more accurately the lack of brains,roth
9457,9458,you see that s really our number one clueeverything else aside this was a pretty stupid thing to do to the president,there he is the president and they do a stupid thing like this,roth
9459,9460,now if this is somebody s idea of a practical joke well i for one do nt consider it funny,you re not just stuffing anybody into a baggie you re stuffing the president of the united states,roth
9461,9462,what about the dignity of his office,if you have no respect for the man what about the office,roth
9463,9464,that s what really gravels me personally,i mean what do you think the enemies of democracy would think if they saw the president of the united states all curled up naked like that,roth
9465,9466,well i ll tell you what they d think they could nt be happier,do you think then that the assassin was an enemy of democracy as well as a madman,roth
9467,9468,i do,and as i said a practical joker,roth
9469,9470,and even if we do nt find him we ve got the boy scouts from boston who confessed to this thing in reserve so i d say on the whole we re in much better shape than we were last time and are really just waiting a goahead from the white house,we are privileged to have with us in the studio one of the most distinguished members of the house of representatives a leading republican statesman and a friend and confidant to the late president,roth
9471,9472,congressman fraud this is a sorrowful day in our nation s history,oh it s a day that will live in infamy there s no doubt about that in my mind,roth
9473,9474,i am in fact introducing a bill into congress to have it declared a day that will live in infamy and celebrated as such in coming years,what you ve got here as chief heehaw at the fbi was saying is a real lack of respect for the office of the presidency,roth
9475,9476,what you ve got here in this assassin is a very disrespectful person and i would agree probably a madman to boot,do you have any idea congressman why the white house continues at this late hour to refuse to confirm the story of the assassination,roth
9477,9478,i think it goes without saying that we re in a sensitive area here and consequently they want to move cautiously on this whole thing,i think they want first off to gauge the public reaction here at home and then of course there is the reaction around the world to consider,roth
9479,9480,on the one hand you ve got our allies who depend upon us for support and on the other hand you ve got our enemies who are always on the lookout for some chink in our armor and if you keep all that in mind then i think you have to agree that in the long run it is probably in the interest of our integrity and our credibility to cover this whole thing up,i would think that some such reasoning as that is going on behind the scenes at the white house right now,roth
9481,9482,has the first lady been notified,oh of course,roth
9483,9484,what was her reaction,well she was understandably quite overcome in the first moment,roth
9485,9486,consequently her immediate reaction was to note that the manner in which the assassin went about the assassination was in extremely bad taste,she said she just had to wonder about the upbringing of a person who would forget something like that,roth
9487,9488,she said she did nt want to blame the assassin s family until she knew all the facts but it was clear she felt there probably could have been a wee bit more attention given to good grooming in his house when the assassin was growing up,what do you think of that idea,roth
9489,9490,not very much,can you explain,roth
9491,9492,well it just does nt make any sense,now he did nt have to do that you knowbut he did because he wanted the people to have all the facts,roth
9493,9494,so i just do nt see how you can fault him there,no i just ca nt see where somebody is going to assassinate the president for a sound policy decision such as this one and that even goes for a madman,roth
9495,9496,no he had the mandate of the people here lunatics included,and the mandate of the congress as well,roth
9497,9498,in their behalf however let me say that even they would not be so reckless as to assassinate the president because of a difference of opinion over some thing like bombing sites,i mean nobody s perfect,roth
9499,9500,and by and large i think you can say that in the end the mistakes in judgment and so on shake themselves out and we pretty much destroy the places that need destroying,it seems to me in fact that as regards the destruction of copenhagen you ll find that even among the president s staunchest critics in the senate there was a sense that a decision of that magnitude simply could nt have been arrived at lightly or arbitrarily,roth
9501,9502,i think most of the truly responsible members of the congress feel as i do that having made a strong show of strength such as this in scandinavia now we are not going to get ourselves bogged down there later the way we did in southeast asia,so you see no connection between the something is rotten in denmark speech and the assassination,roth
9503,9504,no no,frankly i ca nt believe that the murder of the president has to do with anything he has ever said or done including his courageous remarks in behalf of the unborn and the sanctity of human life,roth
9505,9506,no this is one of those wild crazy acts just as the fbi describes itthe work of a madman and as the first lady suggests a pretty illmannered madman at that,it seems to me that any attempt to find some rational political motive in anything so bizarre and boorish as stuffing the president of the united states unclothed into a waterfilled baggie in the fetal position is so much wasted effort,roth
9507,9508,it s an act of violence and disrespect utterly without rhyme or reason and can not but arouse the righteous indignation of reasonable and sensible men everywhere,by trains they come by busses by cars by planes by wheelchairs by feet,roth
9509,9510,come some on canes and crutches and some on artificial limbs,but come undaunted they do like pilgrims of yesteryear and yore to honor pay to him they loved more than they knew,roth
9511,9512,reaped by the grim reaper before his reaping was due he brings us together at last as he promised he one day would do,and doing it he is,roth
9513,9514,it is i daresay a demonstration the likes of which he who has been grimly reaped by the grim reaper did not alas survive to witness,no during his brief residence on this planet earth and his three years in the white house they demonstrated not to honor him but to humiliate him not to pay him homage and respect but to shout their obscenities at and display their disrespect toward him,roth
9515,9516,but these are not the obscenityshouters and the disrespectdisplayers gathering here tonight along the banks of the potomacbanks as old as the republic itselfand beneath the cherry blossoms he so loved and in the brooding grandeur of this the city which embodies that which he who has been untimely reaped would have himself willingly laid down his life for had of him it been asked instead of cruelly being stolen in the night from him by an illmannered madman with a baggie,yet madmen there have been and madmen there will be and still this nation has endured,roth
9517,9518,this is erect severehead with a cogent news analysis from the nation s capital,this is brad bathos,roth
9519,9520,i m down here in the streets of washington now and it is a moving and heartrending sight i see,ever since the news first broke that the president had been found dead in a baggie at walter reed hospital the people of this great country his people have been pouring into the capital from all over the nation,roth
9521,9522,thousands upon thousands simply standing here in the streets surrounding the white house with heads bowed visibly shaken and moved,many are crying openly not a few of them grown men,roth
9523,9524,here is a man seated on the curbstone holding his head in his hands and quietly sobbing,i m going to ask him if he will tell us where he comes from,roth
9525,9526,i come from here i come from washington,you re sitting on the curbstone quietly sobbing into your hands,roth
9527,9528,can you tell us why,can you put it into words,roth
9529,9530,guilt,you mean you feel a personal sense of guilt,roth
9531,9532,yes,why,roth
9533,9534,because i did it,you did it,roth
9535,9536,you killed the president,yes,roth
9537,9538,i ve told everyone,the police,roth
9539,9540,the fbi,i even tried to call pitter dixon to tell her,roth
9541,9542,but all they kept saying was that it was kind of me to think of them at a time like this and mrs,dixon appreciated my sympathy and thought it was in very good taste and then they hung up,roth
9543,9544,meanwhile i should be arrested,i should be in the papersmy picture and a big headline dixon s murderer,roth
9545,9546,but nobody will believe me,here here s the notebooks where i ve been planning it for months,roth
9547,9548,here are tape recordings of my own telephone conversations with friends,here look at this a signed confession,roth
9549,9550,and i was nt even under duress when i wrote it,i was in a hammock,roth
9551,9552,i was fully aware of my constitutional rights,mylawyer was with me as a matter of fact,roth
9553,9554,we were having a drink,herejust read it i give all my reasons and everything,roth
9555,9556,sir interesting as your story is we have to move on,we must move on through this immense crowd,roth
9557,9558,here s a young attractive woman holding a sleeping infant in her arms,she is just standing on the sidewalk gazing blankly at the white house,roth
9559,9560,heaven only knows how much anguish is concealed in that gaze,madam will you tell the television audience what you re thinking about as you look at the white house,roth
9561,9562,you appear to be in a state of shock,i know,roth
9563,9564,i did nt think i could do it,kill,roth
9565,9566,murder,he said let me make one thing perfectly and before he could say clear i had him in the baggie,roth
9567,9568,you should have seen the look on his face when i turned the little twister seal,the look on the president s face when you,roth
9569,9570,yes,i ve never seen such rage in my life,roth
9571,9572,i ve never seen such anger and fury,but then he realized i was staring at him through the baggie and suddenly he looked just the way he does on television all seriousness and responsibility and he opened his mouth i guess to say clear and that was it,roth
9573,9574,i think he thought the whole thing was being televised,andwell was your baby with you when you allegedly,roth
9575,9576,oh yes yes,of course she s too young to remember exactly what happened,roth
9577,9578,but i want her to be able to grow up to say i was there when my mother murdered dixon,imagine itmy little girl is going to grow up in a world where she ll never have to hear anybody say he s going to make something perfectly clear ever again,roth
9579,9580,or let s make no mistake about it,and i did it,roth
9581,9582,i actually did it,i tell you i still ca nt believe it,roth
9583,9584,i drowned him,in cold water,roth
9585,9586,me,and you young man let s move on to you,roth
9587,9588,you re just walking up and down here outside the white house very much as though you ve lost something,you seem confused and bewildered,roth
9589,9590,can you tell us in a few words what it is you re searching for,a cop,roth
9591,9592,a policeman,why,roth
9593,9594,i want to turn myself in,back to erect severehead,roth
9595,9596,erect we re up here on top of the washington monument with the chief of the washington police force,chief shackles how many people would you say are down there right now,roth
9597,9598,oh just around the monument alone we ve got about twentyfive or thirty thousand and i d say there are twice that many over by the white house,and of course more are pouring in every hour,roth
9599,9600,can you describe these people,are they the usual sort of demonstrators you get here in washington,roth
9601,9602,oh no no,i would say they are actually bending over backwards to cooperate with the authorities,roth
9603,9604,so far at any rate,what do you mean by so far,roth
9605,9606,well we have nt yet had to make any arrests,we re under orders from the white house not to arrest anyone under any conditions,roth
9607,9608,as you can imagine this is putting something of a strain on my men particularly as just about everybody down here seems to have come for the purpose of getting himself arrested,i mean i ve never seen anything like it,roth
9609,9610,of course none of it is worth the paper it s written on,some of it s kind of laughable in fact it s so unprofessional and obviously a slapdash lastminute job,roth
9611,9612,but still and all you got to give them credit for their fortitude,they grab hold of my men just like they had the goods on themselves and actually try to handcuff themselves to the officer with their own handcuffs and get carted off to prison that way,roth
9613,9614,we ca nt park a squad car anywhere without half a dozen of them jumping into the back seat and screaming take me to j edgar heehawand step on it,we re sort of humoring them however the best we can and the ones who just wo nt quit we tell them to wait right where they are and we ll round them up later,roth
9615,9616,what we re hoping for is a good thunderstorm during the night that ll sort of break the back of the whole thing,maybe if they stand around long enough in the rain they ll get the idea that nobody is going to arrest them no matter how much evidence they produce and they ll go home,roth
9617,9618,but chief shackles suppose the rain does nt comesuppose they are still jamming the streets in the morning,what about the workers trying to get to government offices,roth
9619,9620,well they ll just have to suffer a little inconvenience i m afraid,because i am not subjecting my men to the charge of false arrest just so somebody can get to his office in time for the morning coffee break,roth
9621,9622,and then there are these orders from the white house,your assumption then is that all these people here are innocent each and every one,roth
9623,9624,absolutely,if they were guilty they would be resisting arrest,roth
9625,9626,they would be running away and so on,they would be screaming about their lawyers and their rights,roth
9627,9628,i mean that s how you can tell they re guilty in the first place,but all these people are saying is i did it take me in,roth
9629,9630,this is brad bathos,violence has erupted here on pennsylvania avenue directly outside the white house gates where upwards of thirty thousand mourners have already gathered to bid farewell to a fallen leader,roth
9631,9632,even as police chief shackles was praising this crowd for their obedience to authority and respect for the law a freeforall broke out among a group of fifteen men in business suits,though police intervention was necessary no arrests were made,roth
9633,9634,i have here beside me one of the gentlemen who was involved in the violent episode and by all appearances he is still rather upset,sir how did the violence begin,roth
9635,9636,well i was just standing here minding my own business trying to confess to an officer about murdering the president when along comes this very fancy guy in a limousine and wearing a flower in his buttonhole and he just steps in between me and the officers and he says he did it,and then the chauffeur gets out of the car and he starts pushing me back and saying let his boss do the talking his boss really did it and he was a very busy man and so on and so forth and who did i think i was acting so high and mighty,roth
9637,9638,well if it was nt for the officer i m not kidding somebody might have gotten hurt,it could have been awful,roth
9639,9640,so you have nothing but praise for the police,well yesup to a point,roth
9641,9642,i mean he broke this thing up onetwothree but then when it was all over he still would nt make any arrests,in fact once he d separated us he just disappeared like the lone ranger used to,roth
9643,9644,i ca nt find him anywhere,some of the other guys want to find him too,roth
9645,9646,see we gave him these confessions and all this incriminating evidence and so onand you know what he did with it,he just tore it up even while he was running away,roth
9647,9648,fortunately i had my secretary xerox all this stuff at my office so i ve got a copy at home but a lot of these guys were foolish enough to give him the only copy of their confessions that they had,about the only good thing to come out of this is the possibility that because the fifteen of us were seen all huddled together on the pavement here pounding each other s heads in we might get picked up as a conspiracy,roth
9649,9650,but go try to find even a plainclothesman when you need one,hey you re not authorized to make an arrest are you by your network or something,roth
9651,9652,and so in they continue to come,and now they have told us why,roth
9653,9654,they come not as they came to washington to mourn the death of president charisma,nor do they come as came they did to atlanta to follow behind the bier of the slain martin luther king,roth
9655,9656,no the crowd that cometh to washington tonighteth cometh not in innocence and bewilderment like little children berefteth of a father,rather cometh they in guilt cometh they to confesseth cometh they to say i too am guilty to the police and the fbi,roth
9657,9658,it is a sight moving and profound and furnishes evidence surely if evidence there need surely be of a nation that has cometh of age,for what is maturity in men or in nations but the willingness to bear the burdenand the dignityof responsibility,roth
9659,9660,and surely responsible it is mature it is when in its darkest hour a nation can look deep within its troubled and anguished blah blah blah blah blah blah blah the guilt of all,those there are who will selfrighteously stand up and shout not me not me,roth
9661,9662,for they are not guilty they are never guilty,and that is what makes this demonstration here in washington of collective guilt so blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,roth
9663,9664,the blah blah of the spirit and the blah blah blah blah blah blah for which our sons have died blah blah blah blah blah blah reason and dignity blah blah blah blah blah dignity and reason,no blame not those who gather here in washington to confess to the murder of the president,roth
9665,9666,ratber praise them for their courage their blah blah blah their blah and their blah blah blah for blah blah blah blah as are you and i we are all guilty,and only at the risk of blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah forget,roth
9667,9668,this is erect severehead from the nation s blah,we hope that by releasing the xrays of both of the president s hips the right virtually within a few hours of the left we will be able to restore some perspective as regards this whole situation,roth
9669,9670,you mean by that the assassination blurp,it may not sell newspapers but i d just as soon for the sake of accuracy stick to the situation,roth
9671,9672,i do nt think we ever denied that,what about the funeral blurb,roth
9673,9674,let s deal with the situation first then we ll get to the funeral,any other questions,roth
9675,9676,where is the president s body right now,resting comfortably,roth
9677,9678,gentlemen do nt push me,he s resting comfortably,roth
9679,9680,that s the important thing,will he be buried in the baggie blurb,roth
9681,9682,one report is that the first lady has decided that given his dedication to the rights of the unborn burial in the baggie would be fitting and proper,like king s body being pulled by a mule train,roth
9683,9684,whatever the first lady decides i m sure it ll be in good taste,blurb what about mr,roth
9685,9686,whatshisname,he s still back of the podium saying it did nt happen that it s a pack of lies,roth
9687,9688,do you have any idea what he s talking about,no comment,roth
9689,9690,blurb is it true that the oath of office has already been secretly administered to the vice president between speaking engagements and that he actually is the president at this very moment,why would we do a thing like that,roth
9691,9692,absolutely not,mr,roth
9693,9694,president can you tell us now why the oath of office was administered to you secretly between speaking engagements so that actually you were the new president even while you went around claiming that the stories of president dixon s assassination were lies perpetrated by the enemies of this country,i think the answer to that is obvious enough gentlemen,roth
9695,9696,you can not have a country without a president any more than you would want to have a cackledooper without a predipitous or likewise a caloodian without a prepregoratory predention,of course the dreedles the drishakis and the dripnaps would give their eyeteeth to have it otherwise but the sworn swaggatelle of this sirigible and the truncation of our truthfulness will not be trampled and torn so long as i as president vent such vindictiveness as the avengers varp,roth
9697,9698,do you have anything to say about that admittedly ugly rumor,yes i have this to say and i propose to say it so that there is no doubt about my feelings on this matter later,roth
9699,9700,were you frightened that they would nt let you be president because you were nt qualified,far from fear what i felt was a filarious frostification at the farreaching fistula into which fate had feductively fastinguished me,roth
9701,9702,sir will you comment on mrs,dixon s decision to bury the president in his baggie at prissier,roth
9703,9704,were you consulted on this and if so does it mean that your administration will be as committed as was his to the rights of the unborn and the sanctity of human life and so on,blah blah blah blah blah blah blah has ended and the republic that blah blah blahblah reason blah blah blah blah,roth
9705,9706,heavy are our blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah corridors blah blah blah that he loved,and the cherry blossoms,roth
9707,9708,blah blah blah blah blah,blah blah blah blah,roth
9709,9710,blah blah blah blah blah lest we blah blah blah blah blah our civilization with it,we can ill afford that,roth
9711,9712,blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,blah blah blah blah of america from the humblest citizen to the blah blah blah blah,roth
9713,9714,blah blah blah blah,blah,roth
9715,9716,blah blah blah blah blah,blah blah,roth
9717,9718,blah blah,blah,roth
9719,9720,blah blah blah blah blah blah blah reason and dignity,blah blah blah blah reason,roth
9721,9722,blah blah blah blah blah dignity,blah blah blah blah blah blah fulfillment of the ameriblah blah blah blah blah blah,roth
9723,9724,blah blah blah one hundred years ago,blah blah blah blah of galilee,roth
9725,9726,and yet those would surrender hope blah blah blah blah blah,blah blah blah blah cherry blossoms,roth
9727,9728,blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah before him,blah blah blah the republic,roth
9729,9730,blah blah blah the people,blah blah blah blah blah nation s capital,roth
9731,9732,our word is leader,now how does noah webster define leader,roth
9733,9734,well noah writes a leader is one who or one that which leads,one who or one that which leads,roth
9735,9736,one who or that which leads,just the day before yesterday i read an article in a current magazine by one of the top philosophers of all time and be wrote leaders are one of man s top necessities,roth
9737,9738,and in a recent gallup poll we ve been reading where more than ninetyeight percent of the people of america believe in leadership,i was in a european country last summer and one of the top young people there told me that the teenagers in his country want leadership more than anything else,roth
9739,9740,president lincolnbefore he was killedsaid the same thing,now when noah tells us that a leader is one who or one that which leads he is telling us what leader means in the ordinary sense of the word,roth
9741,9742,but i wonder if be who lies here before us in this baggie was a leader in the ordinary sense,i do nt think be was,roth
9743,9744,and i ll tell you why,i talked to a psychiatrist friend of mine only this morning and be said he was not an ordinary leader,roth
9745,9746,well you say what was he then if he was nt a leader in the ordinary sense,heand i repeat thathe was a leader in the extraordinary sense of that word,roth
9747,9748,now what does that mean the extraordinary sense of that word,fortunately noah defines extraordinary for us too,roth
9749,9750,you will find the definition on page in your dictionaries in the righthand column six words down directly beneath extraneous,extraordinary noah tells us means beyond what is ordinary out of the regular and established order,roth
9751,9752,beyond what is ordinary,out of the regular and established order,roth
9753,9754,now what does that mean,i read only the week before last in an australian newspaper that i get in my home a story about a fellow who made news down thereand why did he make news down there,roth
9755,9756,he was that rare thing among men,he was himself and no one else,roth
9757,9758,himself and no one else,and what does noah tell us about himself,roth
9759,9760,himself noah says an emphatic form of him,an emphatic form of him,roth
9761,9762,he was emphatically himself and no one else,you know,roth
9763,9764,let me repeat that,you know i have been to funerals of ordinary leaders the world round and i know you have too by way of the miracle of television,roth
9765,9766,we all know the wonderful things that are said on these sorrowful occasions,but i think i have only to repeat the fine words that are intoned over the graves of ordinary dead dignitaries for you to see how truly extraordinary was our own dear departed president in and of himself,roth
9767,9768,in and of himself which you remember noah tells us is the emphatic form of him,now i do nt mean to disparage the ordinary leaders of this great globe by this comparison,roth
9769,9770,i read a letter only three weeks ago thursday that a radical young person wrote to his girl friend disparaging and scoffing and laughing at the leaders of this world,now he may laugh,roth
9771,9772,they laughed at lot,they laughed at amos,roth
9773,9774,they laughed at the apostles,in our own time they laughed at the marx brothers,roth
9775,9776,they laughed at the ritz brothers,they laughed at the three stooges,roth
9777,9778,yet these people became our top entertainers and earned the love and affection of millions,there are always the laughers and the scoffers,roth
9779,9780,and i read an article in a news magazine only sunday before last by one of our top psychologists which says that eightyfive percenteightyfive percent of those who laugh on the outside cry on the inside because of their personal unhappiness,i am not then trying to disparage the ordinary leaders of the world by this comparison,roth
9781,9782,i want only to illustrate to you the extraordinary leadership of the man who walked among us for a brief while in a business suit and now is gone,only yesterday morning at ten am i overheard a lady in an elevator of one of our top hotels say to a young person there has never been another like him in history there will never be another like him again,roth
9783,9784,now,let me repeat that,roth
9785,9786,now when an ordinary leader diesand i mean by ordinary just what noah does on page the last word down in column one of the usual kind or such as is commonly met with when an ordinary leader dies there always seem to be words and phrases aplenty with which to bury him,however how ever when an extraordinary leader dies a man who was himself and no one elsewhat then do we say,roth
9787,9788,let s try a scientific experiment,now science does nt hold all the answers and many of my scientific friends tell me that all the time,roth
9789,9790,so science does nt have all the answers but it has provided us with many wonderful breakthroughs,let s try this scientific experiment,roth
9791,9792,let s try the phrases for an ordinary man on this extraordinary man,and you tell me if you do nt agree that as applies to him who lies here in his baggie they are hollow to the ear and false to the heart and vice versa,roth
9793,9794,let s see if when this experiment is over you do nt say to me why billy you re right they do nt describe him at all,they describe one who or one that which leads but not him who was emphatically himself and no other,roth
9795,9796,i m going to ask that we bow our heads now,every head bowed and every eye closed and listen,roth
9797,9798,they say of an ordinary man when and if he dies that the loss is incalculable to the nation and the world,they say of an ordinary man when and if he dies that all will be better for his having passed their way,roth
9799,9800,need i go any further,there was an article in a current magazine last month by a professor who is an authority on human behavior and he writes that you can tell when a crowd of people is in agreement with you,roth
9801,9802,well the professor is correct,because i know that you are all saying to yourselves why billy you re rightin vain do i listen for the words or word that describes he who lies here in this baggie for these are phrases that summon up the image of an ordinary leader not the extraordinary leader we have lost,roth
9803,9804,what word or words then will describe this extraordinary man,i was in an african country one year ago this july and i heard a top political expert there call him the president of the united states,roth
9805,9806,the president of the united states,the leader of the free world,roth
9807,9808,and a lawyer friend of mine a wellknown judge who lives in south america wrote me a letter not too long ago and he had an interesting thing to say,he said he heard a man in an elevator in a top hotel in buenos aires argentina call him commanderinchief of the american armed forces,roth
9809,9810,chief of the armed forces,yet are these the words in which he lived in the hearts of his fellow countrymen,roth
9811,9812,perhaps that is what he was to the rest of the world,but to we who knew him nothing so majestic or formal could begin to communicate the kind of man he was and the esteem in which he was held,roth
9813,9814,because to us he was not a leader in the ordinary sensehe was a leader in the extraordinary sense,i m going to ask that we bow our heads again,roth
9815,9816,and how appropriate that it is a name even a puppy could bear for we all remember as much as anything about him the deep reverence he had for dogs,the name was a simple one my friends,roth
9817,9818,the name was tricky,yes to you to me and to all americans for generations to come tricky he was and tricky he shall be,roth
9819,9820,and now all heads bowed and every eye closed let us pray,oh god who alone art ever merciful in sparing of punishment humbly we pray thee on behalf of thy servant a man called tricky,roth
9821,9822,for let there be no mistake about it we are engaged in a deadly competition with the kingdom of righteousness,i could not agree more with satan when he says that our goal is not just to keep wickedness for ourselves but to extend it to all creation because that is hell s destiny,roth
9823,9824,to extend it to all creation because the aim of the righteous is not just to hold their own but to extend righteousness,but we can not be victorious over righteousness with a strategy of simply holding the line,roth
9825,9826,my disagreement with satan then is not about the goals for hell but about the means to reach those goals,now satan has said that we are ahead in this competition with righteousness,roth
9827,9828,i can not agree with that appraisal of the situation,as i look at hell today i believe that we are following programs of an outdated leadership,roth
9829,9830,i believe we are following programs many of which have not worked in the past and will not work in the future,i say that the programs and leadership that have failed under satan s administration are not the programs and the leadership that hell needs now,roth
9831,9832,i say that the damned and the doomed do not want to go back to the policies of the garden of eden,i say that the sons and daughters of disobedience deserve a devil of consummate depravity a devil who will devote himself not to old and wornout iniquities but to bold new programs in evil that will overturn god s kingdom and plunge men into eternal death,roth
9833,9834,what we need down here is not just high hopes,what we need is crafty wiles and untiring zeal,roth
9835,9836,in the field of executive leadership i believe it is essential that the devil not only set the tone but he also must lead he must act as he talks,frankly i do nt think this is the kind of leadership we have been getting,roth
9837,9838,now since my arrival i have traveled to the very edges of the outer darkness,i have been down to the bottom of the bottomless pit,roth
9839,9840,i have been burned in the unquenchable fire and have joined you in the comfortless gloom,i have eaten with degenerates and blasphemed with the impious,roth
9841,9842,i have looked into the eyes of the depraved and the malicious,i have familiarized myself with viciousness and baseness of all kinds,roth
9843,9844,and one thing i have noted as i have traveled from one end of hell to the other is the wonderful belief our people have in wickedness,i tell you with great pride that i have never seen anything to equal our corruption,roth
9845,9846,and that is why i do nt think we have to settle for second best,i do nt think we have to settle for anything less than a devil who is the very embodiment of malice,roth
9847,9848,and i humbly submit to you the denizens of the greatest infernal region in all creation that if elected i would be that kind of devil,well maybe it is oldfashioned in some circles but to those of us who live here hell happens to be home,roth
9849,9850,and dating back as it does to the beginning of time it happens to have been home to some of the most illustrious names in history,and i think that with that kind of history and that kind of record it is high time we put hell back on the map and high time the devil was given his due,roth
9851,9852,now i can only say in this regard that maybe satan is satisfied with the fact that at least one half of the people presently on earthand i know this because i just came from thereat least one half of those people no longer believe in the existence of hell let alone its influence in world affairs,and maybe satan is satisfied that the devil the highest official in the underworld once the very symbol of nefariousness to millions is considered in the upper regions to have absolutely no power at all over the decisions made there by men,roth
9853,9854,and maybe satan is satisfied when at least two thirds of the children in the world go to bed at night without any fear of fire or brimstone or an undying worm gnawing at the heart,incidentally in that connection they do nt even fear the pitchfork,roth
9855,9856,and maybe that s all right with satan too,however let me make my position very clear,roth
9857,9858,it s not all right with me,maybe satan is satisfied with the status quo well i m not,roth
9859,9860,i say that when hell is nothing more than a dirty word in the mouths of most people living today then something is wrong and something has to be done about it,what has happened to the devil s net we used to hear so much about,roth
9861,9862,my fellow fallen it is full of holes,my fellow fallen it has run out of steam,roth
9863,9864,and when was the last time you heard the phrase the work of satan,can you even remember,roth
9865,9866,maybe that s because after all these millennia in office satan is satisfied with the status quo,but i m not,roth
9867,9868,i say the devil s work is never done,i say he has a responsibility to get up there among the living and wage war against the forces of righteousness,roth
9869,9870,i say he has a responsibility to the denizens of hell and to all souls everywhere who aspire to wickedness to oppose truth with falsehood,i say he has a responsibility to obscure light with darkness,roth
9871,9872,i say he has a responsibility to entangle men s minds in error,i say he has a responsibility to stir up hatred,roth
9873,9874,i say lie has a responsibility to kindle contentions and combats,we are civilized people in this house and there are some things we do not do and that is number one,roth
9875,9876,we are not riffraff and you remember that,we are able to settle our own arguments and conduct our own affairs and we don t require the police to do it for us,roth
9877,9878,i happen to be the assistant postmaster of this town young lady in case you ve forgotten,i will get to him all right and without your help too,roth
9879,9880,right now i am talking about you and a few things you may not know at fifteen years of age,the way we do it in this house lucy is we talk to a person,roth
9881,9882,that s the only point,i give you a home,roth
9883,9884,then berta started in,i heard what she said to you willard,roth
9885,9886,i heard that tone,where will it stop with her,roth
9887,9888,i thought becoming a catholic at the age of fifteen was going to be the last thing up her sleeve,running off to a catholic church going up to visit nuns for a whole weekend,roth
9889,9890,whoever in their life heard of such a thing,she got scared,roth
9891,9892,higgles were amongst the first settlers who built this town from the ground,carroll,roth
9893,9894,beads and saints and every kind of catholic gimcrack she has got up in that room of hers,and now this,roth
9895,9896,his myra,myra i am sitting here debating what to do,roth
9897,9898,and i am really of two minds i ll tell you that,what has happened here i never thought i would ever live to see,roth
9899,9900,i have spoken to lucy,and i have just finished talking with your mother,roth
9901,9902,she is at the end of her tether myra,i can t say that i blame her,roth
9903,9904,but i believe i have made her see the light,but i have calmed her down he said,roth
9905,9906,she is going to accept my judgment of the thing,myra he said it has been a long twelveyear haul,roth
9907,9908,well what s the answer myra,where is it he is going to get the sticktoitiveness in florida that he is not able to have up here,roth
9909,9910,or oklahoma,the nice climate,roth
9911,9912,it s what we all want,but i wanted her to be a college graduate he said lowering his head into his hands and the sounds that emerged from his mouth might have softened in you everything that had hardened against him if you didn t have to wonder if that wasn t why he was making the sounds in the first place,roth
9913,9914,for the first hour he wept steadily like a woman then gaspingly like a child for another until even though he wanted you to forgive him you almost had to anyway watching him have to perform that way within plain view of his own family,and then the miracle happened,roth
9915,9916,at first he looked to be sick or maybe even about to do something to himself,it was actually frightening to see,roth
9917,9918,for days on end he hardly ate though he was there at every dinner hour in the evening he would sit out on the front porch refusing to speak or to come in out of the cold,once in the middle of the night willard heard moving in the house and came into the kitchen in his robe to see whitey looming over a cup of coffee,roth
9919,9920,what s the trouble whitey can t you sleep don t want to sleep what is it whitey,why are you all dressed here whitey turned to the wall so that all willard could see as his soninlaw s whole big body began to tremble was the back of his broad shoulders and his wide powerful neck,roth
9921,9922,what is it whitey what is it you are thinking of doing,to willard he said want one while i m at it and so willard handed over his shoes and sat there in his stockinged feet while the incredible happened before his very eyes,roth
9923,9924,when the weekend came whitey whitewashed the basement and chopped practically a whole cord of wood willard stood at the kitchen window watching him bring down the ax in violent regular whacks,so that month passed and the next and though eventually he came out of the silent morbid mood and took up a little more his old teasing and kidding ways there could no longer be any doubt that at long last something had happened to penetrate his heart,roth
9925,9926,that winter he grew his mustache,apparently in the first weeks he got the usual jokes from the boys at the shop but he just kept on with it and by march you actually forgot how he used to look and began to believe that the big strapping healthy misdirected boy had at the age of fortytwo decided to become a man,roth
9927,9928,more and more willard heard himself calling him as berta and myra always had by his given name duane,he actually began to behave now as willard had had every reason to expect he would given the eager young fellow he had been back in,roth
9929,9930,at that time he was already a firstrate electrician and a pretty good carpenter too and he had plans ambitions dreams,one of them was to build a house for himself and myra if only she would be his bride a cape codstyle house with a fencedin yard to be built with his own hands and that wasn t so farfetched a dream either,roth
9931,9932,at the age of twentytwo he seemed to have the strength and the vigor for it and the knowhow too,the way he figured it with the exception of the plumbing and a friend over in winnisaw had already agreed to install the piping at cost he could put up a whole twostory house in six months of nights and weekends,roth
9933,9934,he even went ahead and plunked down a onehundreddollar deposit on a tract of land up at the north end a wise move too for what was only woods then was now liberty grove the fanciest section of the town,he had plunked down a deposit he had begun to draw up his own building plans he was halfway into his first year of marriage when along came national quickly by the birth of a daughter,roth
9935,9936,as it turned out whitey took the great depression very personally,it was as though a little baby ready to try its first step stands up smiles puts out one foot and one of those huge iron balls such as they used to knock down whole buildings comes swinging out of nowhere and wallops him right between the eyes,roth
9937,9938,in whitey s case it took nearly ten years for him to get the nerve to stand up and even try walking again,on monday december he took the bus down to fort kean to enlist in the united states coast guard and was rejected for heart murmur,roth
9939,9940,the following week he tried the navy and then his last choice the army,he told them how he had played three years of ball up at the old selkirk high but to no avail,roth
9941,9942,he wound up working over in the fireextinguisher plant in winnisaw for the duration and in the evenings was less and less at home and more and more at earl s dugout,but now here he was on his feet again informing myra that when the school year was over she was to call the parents of her students and tell them that she was going out of the piano business,roth
9943,9944,she knew as well as he did that when she had started giving lessons it was only supposed to be temporary anyway,he should never have allowed her to keep it up even if it did mean extra dollars coming in every week,roth
9945,9946,and he didn t care whether she didn t mind occupying herself that way or not,that wasn t the issue,roth
9947,9948,the issue was he did not require a cushion behind him to catch him if he fell,because he wasn t falling any longer,roth
9949,9950,that was the whole trouble to begin with he had gotten himself all those props and cushions to give him a start back into the world and all they had done was impede his progress by reminding him of the failure he had been right off the bat,somehow you start thinking you re a failure and that there s nothing to do about it and so the next thing you know there is nothing you are doing about it except failing some more,roth
9951,9952,drinking and losing jobs and getting jobs and drinking and losing them it s a vicious cycle myra,maybe he said if he had gone into the army he would have come out of that experience a different person with some of his confidence back,roth
9953,9954,but instead he had to walk the streets of liberty center all those years while other men were risking their while people in town wondered how a big bruiser like whitey nelson had got out of the fighting and dying and pointed a finger at him under their breath for living off his fatherinlaw,no no myra i know what people gossip i know what they the worst of it is they are probably right,roth
9955,9956,no heart murmur isn t a person s fault i know that no the depression isn t a person s fault either but this isn t the depression any more you know,take a look around,roth
9957,9958,this is booming prosperity,this is a new age and this time he was not going to be left behind not when every tom dick and harry you could think of was getting rich and making the money that was just out there for the asking,roth
9959,9960,so the first thing she was to inform those parents that she was out of the music business as of the end of the school year,and the next thing was to think about moving out of her father s house,roth
9961,9962,no not to florida,willard was probably right about that being so much running away from the truth,roth
9963,9964,spring,each evening duane would get up from the dinner at his knees as though just to rise to his feet was a strengthening experience in pitting the new self against the old temptations take a walk all the way down broadway to the river,roth
9965,9966,at eight on the nose he would be back shining his shoes,night after night willard sat across from him in a kitchen chair watching as though hypnotized as though his soninlaw was not just another man cleaning his shoes at the end of a hard day but before willard s eyes inventing the very idea of the shoe brush and polish,roth
9967,9968,he actually began to think that instead of encouraging the fellow to move out of the house he ought now to encourage him to stay,it was becoming a genuine pleasure to have him around,roth
9969,9970,one night in may the two men got to talking seriously together before bedtime the subject was the future,when dawn rose neither could remember who had first suggested that maybe it was really time for duane to go back to the original plan of his life which was to be out contracting on his own,roth
9971,9972,with new housing developments going up everywhere a fellow with his electrical knowhow would be swamped with work within a matter of weeks,it was a matter of the necessary capital to begin and the rest would take care of itself,roth
9973,9974,several hours later a sunny saturday morning shaved and in suits they drove to the bank to inquire about a loan,at seven that evening after a nap and a good dinner duane went off for his constitutional,roth
9975,9976,meanwhile willard sat down with a pencil and pad and began to figure up the available money what the bank said they would loan plus certain savings of his own by eleven he was filling the paper with circles and x s at midnight he got into the car to make once again the old rounds,he found whitey in the alleyway back of chick s barbershop along with a strange negro and a whitewall automobile tire,roth
9977,9978,whitey had his arms wrapped around the tire the colored fellow was out cold on the cement,he did all he could to pry whitey loose from his tire short of kicking him in the ribs but it appeared he was having some kind of romance with it,roth
9979,9980,now damn it willard said dragging him toward the car let go of that thing but whitey staged a sitdown strike on the curb rather than submit to him and his tire being parted,he said he and cloyd here had run great risks in procuring it and besides couldn t willard see,roth
9981,9982,it was brandnew,he carried fifty pounds more than willard and twenty years less and so drunk as he was it was still nearly half an hour back in chick s alleyway before whitey could be detached from what he and his new friend had borrowed from god only knew where,roth
9983,9984,the next morning for all that he was the color of oatmeal he came down to breakfast right on time,wearing a tie,roth
9985,9986,nevertheless two weeks passed before mention was made again of bank loans or personal loans or the electrical contracting business and then it was not willard who brought the matter up,the two were sitting alone in the parlor listening to the white sox game one saturday afternoon when whitey stood and glaring at his fatherinlaw made his indictment,roth
9987,9988,so that s the way it is is willard,adolph mertz who had picked up gertrude after her lesson that afternoon had asked if whitey was still interested in going into electrical contracting a fellow up in driscoll falls was retiring selling everything he owned at a good price equipment truck here whitey swung at her with his trousers and nearly took her eye out with the buckle of his belt,roth
9989,9990,but he hadn t meant was only warning her not to tease him again about something that wasn t his fault,why did she go shooting her mouth off about plans that weren t finalized,roth
9991,9992,didn t she know what the business world was all about,at this stage of the game it was nobody s concern but willard s no matter how much her father wanted now to sneak out of the whole thing,roth
9993,9994,as a matter of fact if it was up to whitey he would go back to that bank any day of the week,it was willard who had withdrawn his support and knocked the confidence out of him about the whole idea after having encouraged him into it to begin with,roth
9995,9996,actually it was living in willard s house that had undermined his confidence all along right from the beginning,a grown man being treated like a charity case,roth
9997,9998,sure blame it on it all on him,but who was it who had cried for her daddy years back just because it was a depression and he was out of work like half the country was damn it,roth
9999,10000,who was it that had led them back to her daddy with his cushy norisk government job,who was it that wouldn t leave for the south with her own husband so as to start a new life,roth
10001,10002,who,him,roth
10003,10004,sure always him,only him,roth
10005,10006,nobody but him,and as for striking he said when he came back from the kitchen with an ice pack for her he ever struck directly at her with the intention of doing her harm,roth
10007,10008,never he cried getting back into his clothes,now all of you can just stand around day and night said whitey buttoning his coat and talk and laugh and tell stories about what kind of failure i i m going there were tears rolling down his face and he was clearly so miserable and brokenhearted that for a moment willard became totally confused or enlightened,roth
10009,10010,at any rate he saw the truth more clearly than he ever had before in all these fifteen years there is nothing the man can do,he is afflicted with himself,roth
10011,10012,like ginny,but when whitey passed him the second gone back to the kitchen for one last glass of their precious water if they didn t nonetheless let the afflicted fellow proceed out the door and for good measure bolted shouted after him i don t care what you are,roth
10013,10014,nobody strikes my daughter,not in this house,roth
10015,10016,willard appeared in the hallway in his robe and slippers and found myra at the top of the stairs in her nightdress,i think it s raining she said,roth
10017,10018,isn t bad feet enough willard shouted up the stairs at her,but what help is it to anything she said for someone to stand out in the rain,roth
10019,10020,let him feel a little rain on him,do you hear me,roth
10021,10022,because it is not your doing,that is the solution mr,roth
10023,10024,whitey began to kick against the door,well that sure takes brains myra doesn t it,roth
10025,10026,sixteen years said willard,sixteen years of solid this,roth
10027,10028,okay said willard,that s more like it,roth
10029,10030,i am not giving in to that kind of behavior myra not now and not ever either,now that it is calm i am going to open the door,roth
10031,10032,and us three are going to sit down in the parlor right now and i don t care if it takes till morning we are going to get to the bottom of this,that was a wednesday night,roth
10033,10034,on sunday lucy came to town,she wore a dark brown maternity dress of some thick material from which her face emerged like a smooth little light bulb,roth
10035,10036,everything about her looked so small as indeed everything was except for the belly,willard spoke again,roth
10037,10038,how about you tell us about you,you re the one with the brandnew life,roth
10039,10040,how s roy,and he knows it,roth
10041,10042,word has gotten around to him all right,he has stayed away three whole days already,roth
10043,10044,four including now,of course berta had made up hers and told him so every night when they got into their bed,roth
10045,10046,with the lights out he would turn one way then the other till his wife who he had thought was asleep beside him said it does not require squirming willard or thrashing around,he goes and if she wants to she goes with him,roth
10047,10048,i believe she is now thirtynine years old age isn t the question berta and you know it not to you it isn t,you baby her,roth
10049,10050,you watch over her like she was solid gold i am not babying anybody,i am trying to use my head,roth
10051,10052,it is complicated berta it is simple willard well it certainly is not and never was not by any stretch of imagination,not with a teenage high school girl involved it wasn t,roth
10053,10054,not when it was a matter of uprooting a whole but lucy doesn t live here any longer and just suppose they had gone,then what,roth
10055,10056,you tell me i don t know willard what would happen to them then or what will now either,but we two will live a human life for the last years we are on this earth,roth
10057,10058,without tragedy popping up every other minute well there are others to consider berta i wonder when it will be my chance to be one of those others,when i am in the grave i suppose if i last that long,roth
10059,10060,the solution willard is simple well it s not and it doesn t get that way either just by your telling me so fifty times a night,people are just more fragile than you give them credit for sometimes well that is their lookout i am talking about our own daughter berta she is thirtynine years old willard,roth
10061,10062,i believe her husband is over forty or is supposed to be,they are their own lookout not mine and not yours well he said after a minute suppose everybody thought like that,roth
10063,10064,that would sure be some fine world to live in all right,everybody saying the other person is not their lookout even your own child she did not answer,roth
10065,10066,suppose abraham lincoln thought that way berta no answer,or jesus christ,roth
10067,10068,there would never even have been a jesus christ if everybody thought that way you are not abraham lincoln,you are the assistant postmaster in liberty center,roth
10069,10070,as for jesus i didn t say i was comparing myself,i am only making a point to you i married willard carroll as i remember it i did not marry jesus christ oh i know that let me tell you if i had known beforehand that i was agreeing to be mrs,roth
10071,10072,to gather his thoughts he looked away from lucy s demanding eyes and out the window,and guess who just then came strolling up the front walk,roth
10073,10074,with his hair wet and combed and his shoes shined wearing his big man s mustache,well said berta mr,roth
10075,10076,once,willard turned to myra,roth
10077,10078,did you tell him to come,no,roth
10079,10080,it s sunday explained myra when no one moved to open the door,and demanded willard,roth
10081,10082,maybe he has something to tell us,something to say,roth
10083,10084,it s sunday,it was an he didn t even mean,roth
10085,10086,i don t know what happened,this is nothing to shout about,roth
10087,10088,as far as we know he has not missed a day of work,the rapping at the glass stopped,roth
10089,10090,for a moment there was not a sound but then the bolt snapped shut and lucy shouted never,do you understand that,roth
10091,10092,oh you said lucy turning on her grandmother,lucy said willard,roth
10093,10094,oh no cried myra for in the meantime she had rushed past them into the hallway,by the time myra had unlocked the door and rushed out on the porch he had turned a corner and was out of sight,roth
10095,10096,gone,till now,roth
10097,10098,lucy had locked him out and whitey had watched her do it to him through the glass he had seen his pregnant eighteenyearold daughter driving shut the bolt against his entering,and had never dared return after that,roth
10099,10100,until now with nearly five years gone and lucy dead he must be waiting down in that station twenty minutes already,unless he had become impatient and decided to go back where he came from unless he had decided that maybe this time he ought to disappear for good,roth
10101,10102,pain shot down willard s right leg from the hip to the toe that sharp sizzling line of pain,cancer,roth
10103,10104,bone cancer,yesterday too he had felt it searing down his calf and into his foot,roth
10105,10106,and the day before,yes they would take him to the doctor xray him put him to bed tell him lies give him painkillers and one day when it got too excruciating ship him off to the hospital and watch him waste away but the pain settled in now like something bubbling over a low flame,roth
10107,10108,no it was not cancer of the bone,it was only his sciatica,roth
10109,10110,but what did he expect sitting outside like this,the shoulders of his jacket were covered with snow so were the toes of his boots,roth
10111,10112,the first sheen of winter glowed on the paths and stones of the cemetery,the wind was down now,roth
10113,10114,it was a cold black night and he was thinking yes sir he would have to pay attention to that sciatica no more treating it like a joke,the smart thing was probably to take to a wheelchair for a month or so so as to get the pressure off the sciatic nerve itself,roth
10115,10116,that was dr,eglund s advice two years ago and maybe it wasn t such a silly idea as it had seemed,roth
10117,10118,a nice long rest,throw an afghan over his knees settle down into a nice sunny corner with the paper and the radio and his pipe and whatever happened in the house let it just roll right by him,roth
10119,10120,just concentrate on getting that sciatic nerve licked once and for all,who d know the difference,roth
10121,10122,yes that might well be a way of solving the whole thing without bringing a wheelchair into the bargain,just look blank shrug your shoulders and walk away,roth
10123,10124,in the months to come he could pretend every once in a while to be slipping some with his faculties,yes sir just have to make their way without him,roth
10125,10126,welcome to use his house for a while that was fine with him but beyond he just wasn t all there in the head you know,maybe to make his point so that it stuck he ought to on purpose to be sure and knowing exactly what he was doing all the while and not in berta s direction of course do as his sad old friend john erwin had begun unfortunately to do and wet the bed,roth
10127,10128,but why,why should i be senile,roth
10129,10130,why be off my head when that is not the case he jumped to his feet,why be getting pneumonia and worrying myself all i did was good the fear of death horrible hateful death caused him to bring his lids tight down over his eyes,roth
10131,10132,good he cried,unto others and down the hill he went shedding snow from his jacket and his cap while his old aching legs carried him as fast as they could out of the graveyard,roth
10133,10134,not until he was past the cemetery road and under the street lamps of south water street did willard s heartbeat begin to resume something resembling a natural rhythm,just because winter was beginning again did not mean that he was never going to see the spring,roth
10135,10136,he was not only going to live till then he was alive right now,and so was everybody shopping and driving in cars problems or not they are alive,roth
10137,10138,alive,we are all alive,roth
10139,10140,oh what had he been doing in a cemetery,at this hour in this weather,roth
10141,10142,come on enough gloomy morbid unnecessary lastminute thinking,there was plenty more to think about and not all of it bad either,roth
10143,10144,just think how whitey will laugh when he hears how in the middle of the night as though in judgment of itself the building that used to house earl s dugout caved right in roof first and had to be demolished,and so what if stanley s is under new management,roth
10145,10146,whitey had as much disdain of a lowdown saloon as anybody when he was being that was a good deal more often than it might appear too when you were purposely setting out to remember the low points in his life,there is a job waiting for him over in winnisaw,roth
10147,10148,that has all been arranged and with his sayso with his wanting it with his asking for it,as for the moving in that is absolutely temporary,roth
10149,10150,believe me i am too old for that other stuff,what we are planning is january the first oh look he cried to the dead i am not god in heaven,roth
10151,10152,i did not make the world,i can not predict the future,roth
10153,10154,he entered the store slamming his wet cap against his knee,and most likely he thought most likely won t be there anyway without coming into the waiting room he set himself to peer inside,roth
10155,10156,most likely i have sat up there for no good reason at all,his hair was now quite gray so was the mustache,roth
10157,10158,he crossed and recrossed his legs so that willard saw the undersides of his shoes pale and smooth,a little suitcase also new sat beside him on the floor,roth
10159,10160,so said willard to himself he did it,actually got on a bus and came,roth
10161,10162,after all that has happened after all the misery he has caused he has had the nerve to get on a bus and then get off it and to wait here half an hour expecting to be picked up oh you idiot he thought and unseen yet glared at his middleaged soninlaw his new shoes his new sure new man too,you dumb cluck,roth
10163,10164,you scheming lying thieving ignoramus,you weak washedout lushhead sucking the life s blood from every human heart there is,roth
10165,10166,you nogood lowlife weakling,so what if you can t help it,roth
10167,10168,he would drop his long skinny frame into a big club chair in his uncle s living room and instantly slide half out of it so that his army shoes and army socks and khaki trousers were all obstacles to cross over if you wanted to go by as his cousin eleanor and her friend lucy often did when he was visiting,he would sit there absolutely motionless his thumbs hooked around the beltless loops of his trousers and his chin tipped down onto his long tubular chest and when asked if he was listening to what was being said to him he would nod his head without even raising his glance from his shirt buttons,roth
10169,10170,or sometimes with his bright fair face with those blue eyes as clear as day he would look up at whoever was advising him or questioning him and see them through a frame that he made with his fingers,in the army roy had developed an interest in drawing and profiles were his specialty,roth
10171,10172,he was excellent on noses the bigger the better good on ears good on hair good on certain kinds of chins and had bought a manual to teach himself the secret of drawing a mouth which was his weak point,he had even begun to think that he ought to go ahead and try to become a professional artist,roth
10173,10174,he realized it was no easy row to hoe but maybe the time had come in life for him to tackle something hard instead of settling for the easiest thing at hand,it was his plan to become a professional artist that he had announced upon his return to liberty center late in august he had barely set down his duffel bag in the living room when the first argument began,roth
10175,10176,you would have thought he was a kid returning home from camp gitche gumee instead of the aleutian islands,if he had forgotten in the time away what life had been like for him during his last year of high school it did not take lloyd and alice bassart more than half an hour to refresh his recollection,roth
10177,10178,the argument which went on for days consisted for the most part of his parents saying they had had experiences he hadn t and roy saying that now he had had experiences they hadn t,after all it just might be he said that his opinion counted for since what they were discussing was his career,roth
10179,10180,to make a point in fact he spent the whole of his third day home copying a girl s profile off a matchbook cover,he worked it over and over and over taking just a quick break for lunch and only after an entire afternoon behind the locked door of his bedroom did he believe he had gotten it right,roth
10181,10182,he addressed three different envelopes after dinner until he was satisfied with the lettering and then sent the picture off to the art school which was in kansas city all the way downtown to the post office to be sure that it made the evening mail,when a return letter announced that mr,roth
10183,10184,roy basket had won a fivehundreddollar correspondence course for only fortynine fifty he tended to agree with his uncle julian that it was some kind of clip joint and did not pursue the matter any further,just the same he had proved the point he had set out to prove and right off,roth
10185,10186,when he had been called up by the draft board for his two years service his father had said that he hoped a little military discipline would do something toward maturing his son,he himself seemed willing to admit bungling the job,roth
10187,10188,well the way things turned out roy had matured and plenty too,but it wasn t discipline that had done it it was to put it bluntly being away from them,roth
10189,10190,in high school he may have been willing to slide through with c s and cminuses when with a little application of his intelligence alice bassart which you have roy in abundance he could easily have had straight b even a s if he had wanted them,but the point he wished to make was that he was no longer that c student and no longer would be treated like him either,roth
10191,10192,if he put his mind to a job he could do it and do it well,the only problem now was which job it was going to be,roth
10193,10194,at the age of twenty nobody had to tell him that it was high time to begin thinking about becoming a man,because he was thinking about it and plenty don t worry,roth
10195,10196,he continued to work on his own out of the art manual in exasperation moving on to the neck and the shoulders after four days of going from bad to worse with the mouth,though he by no means relinquished his first choice of being a professional artist he was willing to meet his family halfway and at least listen to whatever suggestions they might have,roth
10197,10198,he had to admit being tempted by uncle julian s suggestion that he come to work for him and learn the laundromat business from the ground up,what was particularly appealing about the idea was that the people in the towns along the river would see him driving around in julian s pickup truck and think of him as some punk kid and the ladies who managed the laundromats would think of him as the boss s nephew and suppose his life was just a bed of in actuality his real work would only begin at night after everyone was asleep and behind his bedroom door he stayed awake till dawn perfecting his talent,roth
10199,10200,what wasn t too appealing was the idea of using family as a crutch and right at the outset,he couldn t bear the thought of hearing for the rest of his life of course it was julian gave him his start but of more significance was the damage that accepting something like this could do to his individuality,roth
10201,10202,not only would he never really respect himself if he just stepped into a job and rose solely on the basis of personal privilege but how would he ever realize his own potential if he was going to be treated like one of those rich kids who were just coddled up the ladder of success their whole life long,and there was julian to consider,roth
10203,10204,he said he was altogether serious about the offer provided roy really wanted to work the long hard hours he would demand of him,well the long hard hours didn t bother him,roth
10205,10206,a really vicious mess sergeant had once just out of meanness kept him on kp for seventeen consecutive hours scrubbing pots and pans and after that experience roy realized he could do just about anything,so once he had made up his mind about the direction his life was going to take he had every throw julian s language right back at working his balls into the ground,roth
10207,10208,but what if he went in with julian started taking a salary and then decided to go off in september to the art institute in chicago or even to art school in new york which was by no means impossible,he was giving his parents objection every consideration whether they appreciated that or not but if he finally did decide in favor of professional artist as a career wouldn t he have wasted not only his time but julian s as well,roth
10209,10210,probably to his uncle whose affection he valued he would wind up seeming maybe that would even be sort of true,ingratitude was something he had to guard against in himself,roth
10211,10212,though he was sure his classmates at school and his buddies in the service thought of him as easygoing and first sergeant used to sometimes call him steppin had been told he had a tendency to be selfish,not that everybody didn t have one of course but certain people had a way of exaggerating things all out of proportion and he just didn t feel like giving an ounce of support to a suspicion about him which it was actually unfair for anybody particularly a person s own father to hold in the first place,roth
10213,10214,moreover what he had a real taste for following the monotony and tedium of the preceding months was adventure and you couldn t really expect that the laundromat business would be packed with thrills or even particularly interesting to be frank about it,as for the security angle money really didn t matter that much to him,roth
10215,10216,he now had two thousand dollars in savings and separation pay plus the gi,bill and anyway he had no ambition to be a millionaire,roth
10217,10218,that s why when his father told him that artists wind up living in garrets roy was able to say what s so wrong with that,what do you think a garret is,roth
10219,10220,it s an attic,my own room used to be the attic you know a fact mr,roth
10221,10222,bassart couldn t easily dispute,what he had a taste for was adventure something to test himself against some way to discover just how much of an individual he really was,roth
10223,10224,and if it wasn t the life of an artist maybe it was some kind of a job in a foreign country where to the natives he would be a stranger to be judged only by what he did and said and not by what they knew about him from before but saying such things was often only another way of saying you wanted to be a child again,aunt irene made that point and he was willing to admit to himself that she could be right,roth
10225,10226,he was always willing to listen to what ideas his aunt irene had because she usually said what she had to say in private and wasn t just talking to impress people a tendency of uncle julian s she didn t butt in or raise her voice when you argued back or disagreed his father s courteous approach and she didn t ever respond with sheer hysterics to some idea or other he had most likely thrown out just to hear how it sounded as his mother had a habit of doing,his mother and his aunt irene were sisters but two people couldn t have been more different in terms of calmness,roth
10227,10228,for example when he said that maybe what he ought to do was leave liberty center with a pack on his back and see what the rest of the country had to offer before making any major choice he would later be stuck with aunt irene registered some interest in the idea,all his mother could do was push the old panic button as they used to say in the service,roth
10229,10230,instantly she started to tell him that he had just returned from two years away which of course he didn t know and to tell him that he ought to make up his mind to go to the state university and use that intelligence of his as god meant you to use it roy and then finally to accuse him of not listening to a word she said,but he was listening all right even sunk down in that big chair he took in all her objections more or less,roth
10231,10232,those she had raised previously a hundred times or more he felt he had the right to tune out on but he got the drift of her remarks more or less,she wanted him to be a good little boy and do what he was told she wanted him to be just like everybody else,roth
10233,10234,and really right his mother s words and reason enough for him to be out of town by nightfall,maybe that s what he ought to do just shove off and not look backonce he had made up his mind what part of the country he ought to see first,roth
10235,10236,there was always a sack for him in seattle washington where his best army buddy willoughby lived and willoughby s kid sister whom roy was supposed to be fixed up with,another good buddy hendricks lived in texas his father owned a ranch where roy could probably work for his grub if he ever ran short of loot,roth
10237,10238,and then there was boston,it was supposed to be beautiful in boston,roth
10239,10240,it was the most historic city in america,i might just try boston he thought even as his mother went gaily on losing her senses,roth
10241,10242,he had spent sixteen months in that black hole of calcutta as they called it eight to five every day in that scintillating motorpool then those nights,if he ever saw another pingpong ball in his life and the weather,roth
10243,10244,it made liberty center seem like a jungle in south america,wind and snow and that big gray sky that was about as inspiring to look at as a washed blackboard,roth
10245,10246,and that mud,and that chow,roth
10247,10248,and that narrow soggy undersized sonofabitching really excuse for a bed,actually he owed it to himself not to go anywhere until he had caught up on all the rest he had probably lost on that gd,roth
10249,10250,gotten one or two of his taste buds back to functioning too,after an experience like that he surely couldn t say he minded having breakfast served to him in a nice bright kitchen every morning and having a room of his own again where everything didn t have to be squared away with a plumb bob or taking as long as he wanted or just needed in the john with the door closed and nobody else doing his business at either elbow,roth
10251,10252,it felt all right he could tell you to eat a breakfast that wasn t all dishwater and cardboard and then to settle down in the living room with the leader and read it at your leisure without somebody pulling the sports page right up out of your hands,as for his mother chattering away at him nonstop from the kitchen he wasn t so stupid that he couldn t understand that why she was concerned for him was because he happened to be her son,roth
10253,10254,she loved him,simple,roth
10255,10256,sometimes when he finished with the paper he would come into the kitchen where she was working and no matter what silly thing she was saying put his arms around her and tell her what a good kid she was,sometimes he d even dance a few steps with her singing some popular song into her ear,roth
10257,10258,it didn t cost him anything and as far as she was concerned it was seventh heaven,she really meant well his mother even if some of her pampering ways were a little embarrassing at this stage of the game,roth
10259,10260,like sending him that package of toiletseat liners,that s what he had received at mail call one day a hundred large white tissues each in the shape of a doughnut which she had seen advertised in a medical magazine at the doctor s office and which he was supposed to sit the army,roth
10261,10262,at first he actually thought of showing them to his first sergeant who had been wounded in the back at anzio during world war ii,but thinking that sergeant hickey might misunderstand and instead of making fun of his mother make fun of him he had strolled around back of the mess hall late that night and furtively dumped them into a can of frozen garbage careful first to remove and destroy the card she had enclosed,roth
10263,10264,it read roy please use these,nevertheless there had been times up in adak when he missed her and even missed his father and felt about them as he had in those years before they had started misunderstanding every word that came out of his mouth,roth
10265,10266,he would forget about all the things they said he did wrong and all the things he said they did wrong and think that actually he was a pretty lucky guy to have behind him a family so concerned for his wellbeing,there was a guy in his barracks who had been brought up in boys town nebraska and though roy had a lot of respect for him he always had to feel sorry for all that he had missed not having a family of his own,roth
10267,10268,his name was kurtz and even though he had the kind of bad skin roy didn t exactly like to have to look at at mealtime he often found himself inviting him to come to visit in liberty center after they all got sprung from this prison and taste his mom s cooking,kurtz said he sure wouldn t mind,roth
10269,10270,nor would any of them have minded for that matter one of the big events in the barracks was the arrival of what came to be known as mother bassart s goodies when roy wrote and told his mother that she was the second most popular pinup girl in the barracks after jane russell she began to send two boxes of cookies in each package one for roy to keep for himself and another for the boys who were his friends,as for miss jane russell her latest film had been banned by a court order from the movie house in winnisaw a fact which alice bassart hoped roy would take to heart,roth
10271,10272,that roy read to sergeant hickey and they both got a good laugh out of it,in the months then after his discharge roy made it his business first to catch up on his sleep and second to catch up on his food,roth
10273,10274,every morning about quarter to after his father had disappeared for the would come down in khakis and a tshirt to a breakfast of two kinds of juice two eggs four slices of bacon four slices of toast a mound of bing cherry preserves a mound of marmalade and just to shock his mother who never had seen him take anything at breakfast but milk he called hot joe or hot java some mornings he downed a whole pot of hot joe and he could see that actually she didn t know whether to be scandalized by what he was drinking or thrilled by the amount,she liked to do her duty by him when it came to food and since it didn t cost him anything he let her,roth
10275,10276,and you know what else i drink alice he d say smacking his gut with his palm as he rose from the table,it didn t make the same noise as when sergeant hickey who weighed two twentyfive did it but it was a good sound just the same,roth
10277,10278,roy she d say don t be smart,and he was usually did,roth
10279,10280,after all was said and done he and alice had a good relationship,then a look at the paper from cover to cover then back into the kitchen for a quick glass of milk,roth
10281,10282,it was hard to believe that only two years before he had been one of those kids whose heads he would see turned down over their books suffering,but it was almost as hard to believe that he wasn t one of them too,roth
10283,10284,one morning just for the heck of it he walked all the way up to the main door right there by the flagpole and listened to the voice of his old math teacher criss cross that sweetheart droning through the open window of,never again in roy s entire he have to walk up to the board and stand there with the chalk in his hand while old criss gave him a problem to do in front of the entire class,roth
10285,10286,to his surprise the revelation made him very sad,and he had hated algebra,roth
10287,10288,he had barely passed,when he had come home with a d his father had practically hit the ceiling boy the things you can miss he thought if you re a little crazy in the head and strolled on down through the ravine and out to the river where he sat in the sun by the landing separating hydrox cookies eating first the bare half then the half to which the filling had adhered and thinking twenty,roth
10289,10290,twenty years old,twentyyearold roy bassart he watched the flow of the river and thought that the water was like time itself,roth
10291,10292,at the px in adak they wouldn t make a grilled cheese and bacon and tomato sandwich,don t ask why he once said to uncle julian,roth
10293,10294,they just wouldn t do it,they had the cheese and the bacon and the tomato and the bread but they just wouldn t put it all together on the grill even if you told them how,roth
10295,10296,you could talk yourself red in the face to the guy behind the counter but he simply wouldn t do it,well that s the old chicken army as he told julian,roth
10297,10298,afternoons he would often drop by the public library where his old steady bev collison used to work after school,with his drawing pad in his lap he would look through magazines for scenes to copy out,roth
10299,10300,he had lost interest in the human head and decided that rather than drive himself crazy trying to get a mouth to look like something that opened and closed he would specialize in landscapes,he looked through hundreds of holiday much he did get to read about a lot of places and national customs of which he was totally ignorant so it wasn t time when he fell asleep because the library as usual was so damn stuffy and you actually had to make a requisition to get them to open a window and let some air in the place,roth
10301,10302,just like the army,the most simpleminded thing and you had to go around all day getting somebody s permission to do it,roth
10303,10304,oh brother was it good to be free,with a whole life ahead of him,roth
10305,10306,a whole future in which he could be and do anything he wanted,during the fall he would usually walk back out to the high school late in the afternoon to watch the football team practice and stay on until it was practically dark moving up and down the sidelines with the plays,roth
10307,10308,close in like that he could hear the rough canvasy slap,as the linemen came sound he especially actually see those amazing granite legs of tug sigerson which were said never to stop churning even at the bottom of a pileup,roth
10309,10310,they would pull ten guys off him and there would be old tug still going for the extra inch the inch that by the end of a game really could be the difference between victory and defeat,or suddenly he would have to go scattering back with the little crowd of spectators as one of the halfbacks came galloping straight at them spraying chunks of dirt so high and so far that on his way home roy sometimes found a little clump of the playing field in his hair,roth
10311,10312,wild bill had spent three years faking the opposition out of their pants and was the highestscoring end at liberty center since the days of bud brunn himself,in about one second flat he would fake the defense right left then cut left buttonhook take a bobby rackstraw bullet right in the belly just a right again only to turn and zoom straight down the center of the gardner dorsey the head coach blew his whistle and bill came loping on back in that pigeontoed way he had tossing a long underhand spiral toward the line of scrimmage and calling out heads up baby whereupon one of the onlookers beside roy would say ol bill would have gone all the way that time or roy might even say it himself,roth
10313,10314,from over on the baseball field he would hear the band being put through their paces for saturday s game,attention please band,roth
10315,10316,baand he could hear mr,for the hour of the day for the time of his life for this america where it is all peacefully and naturally happening he feels an emotion at once so piercing and so buoyant it can only be described as love,roth
10317,10318,one of the stars of the football team in the fall following roy s discharge from the army was joe the toe whetstone,he was a fleetfooted halfback he d done the hundred in and the greatest placekicker in the history of the high said the history of the state,roth
10319,10320,since the summer joe had been dating roy s kid cousin ellie and on saturday nights while julian and roy were having a talk together or a beer joe would come around to pick up ellie and take her to what had become a weekly event for the liberty center stallions the victory party,he would sit with the two of them in the tv room while the princess sowerby as julian called her decided what dress to wear,roth
10321,10322,at first roy didn t have too much to say to joe,he had never really traveled with the athletes in high school or with any gang if he could help it you lost your identity in a gang and roy considered himself a little too much of an individualist for that,roth
10323,10324,not a loner but an individualist and there s a big difference,but joe whetstone turned out to be nothing like roy had imagined,roth
10325,10326,you might have thought that with his reputation and being so goodlooking he would turn out to be another one of those swellheaded wise guys like wild bill elliott who was big for spitting through his teeth into the aisle at the movies in winnisaw or so roy had heard,but joe was respectful and polite to the to roy too,roth
10327,10328,it took a while but slowly roy began to understand that the reason joe sat there in his coat nodding his head at whatever roy might say and himself saying hardly anything at all was not because he was looking down his nose at him but because he was actually looking up,joe might be the greatest high school placekicker in the history of the state but roy had just come back from sixteen months in the aleutian islands across the bering sea from russia itself,roth
10329,10330,and joe knew it,one saturday night when ellie came bounding down the stairs joe jumped to his feet and roy realized that the famous joe the toe with six different scholarship offers already in his hip pocket was really nothing more than what ellie seventeenyearold kid,roth
10331,10332,and roy was twenty roy was an,very shortly roy began to hear himself on saturday nights saying things like they sure gave you the rush act today joe or how s bart s ankle or how bad s the rib going to be on the guardello kid some nights now it was ellie who had to do the waiting while the three men finished up discussing whether dorsey ought to have converted sigerson from a tackle in the first place or whether bobby rackstraw was going to be too slight for college ball bullet arm or no bullet arm or whether wild bill ought to go to michigan which had the big name or to kansas state where at least he could be sure he was going to be with a coach who liked to move the old ball in the air,roth
10333,10334,those afternoons roy went over to watch football practice he would almost always end up moseying over to the wooden bleachers back of the goal post so as to watch headon as joe placed his fifty through the uprights,after joe had finished so long roy see you kiddo would button his field jacket turn up the collar lean back on his elbows stretch his legs down across three rows of wooden stands and with a little smile on his face hang around a few minutes more watching the cheerleaders go through their ohsoimporant repertoire of tricks,roth
10335,10336,whenever he saw her in the halls he would begin to perspire along his upper lip just as he did in class when suddenly he found himself called upon to answer a question he hadn t even heard the teacher ask,and the fact was that he and ginger had never exchanged a word and probably never would,roth
10337,10338,however she was built as the saying goes like a brick s house a fact roy couldn t seem to ignore not that he always tried,in bed at night he would begin to think about the way she had of leaning back from the waist to do the liberty center locomotive and he would get an erection at the games themselves after a touchdown ginger would do cartwheels the length of the field and everybody would be screaming and cheering and roy would be sitting there with an erection,roth
10339,10340,and it was ridiculous because she wasn t that kind of girl at all,nobody had ever even kissed her supposedly and besides she was a catholic and catholic girls wouldn t even let you put your arm around them in the movies until you were married or at least engaged,roth
10341,10342,or so went one story,another was that all you had to do was tell them you were going to marry them right after graduation and they spread as the saying goes on the very first date,roth
10343,10344,even where ginger was concerned there had been stories,almost every guy in liberty center would tell you that you couldn t get near her with a tenfoot pole and a lot of the girls said she was actually thinking about becoming a nun,roth
10345,10346,but then this fellow named mufflin who was about twentyfive and used to hang around the high school smoking with kids said that his friends over in winnisaw told him that at a party across the river one night back in ginger s freshman year before she d gotten so snooty she had practically taken on the whole winnisaw football team,the reason nobody knew about it was because the truth was immediately suppressed by the catholic priest who threatened to have all those involved thrown in jail for rape if even one of them opened his mouth,roth
10347,10348,it was a typical mufflin story and yet some guys actually believed roy wasn t one,roy s usual taste in girls ran to the ones who were a little more serious and sedate about collison for instance who had more or less been his private property during senior year and was now a junior in elementary ed at the university of minnesota where roy thought he might decide to go at the last minute if everything else fell through,roth
10349,10350,bev was one of the few girls around who didn t live her life as though she were in a perpetual popularity contest she would just as soon leave the showing off to the showoffs and didn t go in for giggling and whispering and wasting whole evenings on the phone,she d had a straight average worked after school at the library and still had time for extracurricular activities spanish club citizenship club the liberty bell advertising manager and a social life,roth
10351,10352,she had her two feet on the ground even his parents,and he had always respected her a lot,roth
10353,10354,actually it was because of this respect that he had never tried to make her go all the way,still it was the hottest and heaviest he had ever gone at it with anyone,roth
10355,10356,in the beginning they used to kiss standing up in her front hallway for as long as an hour at a stretch but all the time in their coats,then one saturday after a school dance bev agreed to let him into the living room she took off her own coat and hung it up but refused to let roy remove his saying he had to go in two minutes because her parents bedroom was directly over the sofa toward which roy was to stop trying to push her,roth
10357,10358,it was several weeks more before he was finally able to convince her that he ought really to be allowed out of his coat if only as a health measure and even then she didn t consent so much as give up the fight after roy had already sort of slipped it half onto the floor necking with her all the while so she wouldn t know,and then one night after a long bitter struggle she suddenly began sobbing,roth
10359,10360,roy s first thought was that he ought to get up and go home before mr,collison came down the stairs but he patted her a lot on the back and said everything was all right and that he was really sorry he hadn t actually meant it and so bev asked sounding relieved hadn t he really,roth
10361,10362,and though he didn t know exactly what they were talking about he said of course not never no and so from then on to his immense surprise she was willing to let him put his hand wherever he wanted above the belt so long as it was outside her clothes,there followed a bad month during which bev got so angry with him that they very nearly broke up meanwhile roy was pushing and pulling and pleading and apologizing all to no one night fighting him off bev inadvertently she tearfully contended later sank a fingernail so deep into his wrist that she drew blood,roth
10363,10364,afterward she felt so rotten about it that she let him put his hand inside her blouse though not inside her slip,it so excited roy that bev had to whisper roy,roth
10365,10366,my snorting like that then one night in bev s dark living room they turned on the radio very very low and of all things on rendezvous highlights they were playing the music from the movie state fair which had recently been revived over in winnisaw,it was their movie and it might as well be spring was their had gotten bev to agree,roth
10367,10368,in fact roy s mother said that he looked a little like dick haymes though as bev commented least of all when he tried to sing like him,nevertheless in the middle of it s a grand night for singing bev just fell backward on the sofa with her eyes closed and her arms behind her neck,roth
10369,10370,he wondered for a moment if it was really what she wanted decided it must be decided it had to be and so taking the chance of his life drove his hand down between her slip and her brassiere,unfortunately in the newness and excitement of what she was letting him do he caught the buckle of his watchband on the ribbing of her best sweater,roth
10371,10372,when bev saw what had happened she was heartsick and then scared and so they had to stop everything while she worked to pick up the stitch with a bobby pin before her mother saw it in the morning and wanted an explanation,then on the saturday before graduation it happened in the pitchblack living room he got two fingers down onto her nipple,roth
10373,10374,bare,and the next thing he knew she was off visiting her married sister in superior and he was in the army,roth
10375,10376,as soon as he was shipped to the before the first shock of the place had worn had written bev asking her to get the university of minnesota to send him an application form,when it arrived he began to spend a little time each evening filling it out but shortly thereafter it became evident to him that letters from bev herself had just stopped coming,roth
10377,10378,fortunately by this time he was more adjusted to the bleakness of his surroundings than he had been on that first terrible night and so was able to admit to himself that it had been pretty stupid to think of choosing a university because a girl he once knew happened to be a student there,and absolutely idiotic is what it would have been if after being discharged he had gone ahead and showed up in minneapolis to find that this girl had picked up with somebody new neglecting however to tell him anything about it,roth
10379,10380,so the application remained only partially completed though it was still somewhere among his papers all of which he planned to go through as soon as he could have two or three uninterrupted days so as to do the job right,the cheerleader roy was sort of interested in was named mary littlefield though everybody called her monkey he soon discovered,roth
10381,10382,she was small and had dark bangs and for a short girl she had a terrific figure which you really couldn t say was the case with beverly collison whom in his bitterness roy had come to characterize and not unjustly as flat as a board,monkey littlefield was only a junior which roy figured was probably too young for him now and if it turned out that she didn t have a brain in her head then it was just going to be curtains for little monkey even before the first date,roth
10383,10384,what he was in the market for this time was somebody with a little maturity in her attitudes,but monkey littlefield did have this terrific figure with these really terrifically developed muscles in her legs and that she was a bigshot cheerleader didn t faze him as it had with ginger donnelly two years before,roth
10385,10386,what was a cheerleader anyway but a girl who was an extrovert,moreover monkey lived up in the grove and so she knew who roy was ellie sowerby s cousin and a good friend of joe whetstone s,roth
10387,10388,he imagined that she knew he was an exgi,simply because of his clothes,roth
10389,10390,the team would begin drifting off the field their silver helmets swinging at their sides as they headed for the locker room,the cheerleaders would pick up their coats and schoolbooks from where they lay in piles on the first row of bleachers and roy would raise himself up to his full six feet three inches stretch his arms way out and yawn so that anybody watching would just think of him as being more or less easygoing and unruffled,roth
10391,10392,his father might not like the idea now any more than he had in high school but the money roy had saved in the service was his own and he could spend it just as he liked,the family car had to be asked for days in advance and had to be back in the garage at a specific time every night only with a car of his own would he ever be truly independent,roth
10393,10394,with a car of his own he might just give this littlefield a run for her he had made sure that she wasn t just an extrovert and nothing else and if she was,should that stop him,roth
10395,10396,something about the muscles in her legs told roy that monkey littlefield either had gone all the way already or would for an older guy who knew how to play his cards right,up in the aleutians it seemed that almost every guy in the barracks had gotten some girl to go all the way except roy,roth
10397,10398,since it didn t hurt anyone and wasn t so much a lie as an exaggeration he had intimated that he himself had gone all the way pretty regularly with this girl from the university of minnesota,one night after lights out lingelbach who really had the gift of gab was saying that the trouble with most girls in the usa,roth
10399,10400,was that they thought sex was something obscene when it was probably the most beautiful experience physical or spiritual that a person could ever have,and because it was dark and he was angry had said yeah that was why he had finally dumped this girl from the university of minnesota she thought sex was something to be ashamed of,roth
10401,10402,to hear him talk he knew every sex secret there ever was,all you have to do to make a girl spread her chops said cuzka is to tell her you love her,roth
10403,10404,you just keep saying it over and over and finally i don t care who they are i don t care if they re maria montez they can t resist,tell them you love them and tell them to trust you,roth
10405,10406,how do you think errol flynn does it,asked cuzka who acted most of the time as though he had a direct pipeline to hollywood,roth
10407,10408,just keep saying trust me baby trust me and meanwhile start unzipping the old fly,then cuzka began to tell how his brother a mechanic in san diego had once banged this fiftyyearold whore with no teeth and soon roy felt pretty lousy about saying what he had out loud,roth
10409,10410,skinny and scared as bev had been she was really a good kid,how could she help it if her parents were strict,roth
10411,10412,the next day he was able partially to console himself over his betrayal by remembering that he hadn t actually mentioned her name,lloyd bassart had come to the conclusion that roy ought to apprentice himself to a printer over in winnisaw,roth
10413,10414,his father liked to say the word apprentice just about as much as roy hated to hear him say it,the knowledge of this aversion in his son didn t stop him however roy ought to apprentice himself to a printer over in winnisaw he knew his way around a print shop and it was an honorable trade in which a man could make a decent living,roth
10415,10416,he was sure that the bigelow brothers could find a place for not because he was lloyd bassart s boy but because of the skills the young man actually possessed,artists starve as anyone knows unless they happen to be rembrandt which he didn t think roy was,roth
10417,10418,as for enrolling in college given roy s grades in high school his father could not imagine him suddenly distinguishing himself at an institution of higher learning by his scholarly or intellectual abilities,though alice bassart pointed out that stranger things had happened her husband did not seem to believe they would in this instance,roth
10419,10420,lloyd bassart was the printing teacher at the high schoolnot to mention the right arm of the principal donald bud brunn the onetime allamerican end from the university of wisconsin,when the new consolidated high school had been built in liberty center in people still had a picture in their minds of don brunn making those sensational endzone catches over his shoulder during his four years in the big ten,roth
10421,10422,what catching a football over your shoulder had to do with organizing a curriculum or estimating a budget was something that would remain incomprehensible to alice bassart until the day she died but nevertheless on the basis of that skill don who had been teaching civics and coaching athletics down in a high school in fort kean was offered the position in his old hometown,being no fool at least where his own interests were involved he accepted,roth
10423,10424,and so for eighteen solid years of midstream as alice expressed it whenever her anger caused her to become slightly had been the principal at least he sat in the principal s office and lloyd had been what alice bassart called the unofficial unsung hero don wouldn t so much as hire a new janitor without letting lloyd take a look at him first and yet don got the salary of a principal and was some kind of household god to parents in the community while lloyd as far as the general public was concerned was nobody,after this much time you certainly couldn t go around all day hoping and praying that the fellow might see the light and resign if he could see that much light there might not be any cause for him to resign,roth
10425,10426,nor could you wait for him to slip on a banana peel for one thing don was a healthy ox destined to outlive them all and for another such an idea was beneath alice even to think let alone to say aloud,either you could make your way through life with the bitter taste of envy always in your mouth or you could remember that there are people in this world far worse off than yourself and be thankful that you are who you are and have what you have and so on,roth
10427,10428,could roy help it if he felt more like spending his evenings at uncle julian s than at home,not that he considered julian perfect by any means but at least his uncle believed in having something of a good time in life and all his ideas weren t about two centuries old,roth
10429,10430,wake up roy wanted to shout into his father s ear,it s but that julian knew what year it was you could see right off even in something like his clothes,roth
10431,10432,whereas the big magazine in roy s house was hygeia julian took esquire every month and followed their clothing tips from top to toe,he was maybe a little too loud with his color combinations at least for roy s taste but you had to admit he was right in the current style whatever it happened to be,roth
10433,10434,even his opinion of mr,harry s truman half asshole and half red didn t keep him from having a collection of harry truman sport shirts that could knock your eye out at any rate to appear in a public place without a tie wasn t something julian considered a scandal nor did he act as though life on this planet was coming to an end if roy showed up at the house with his shirttail accidentally hanging out,roth
10435,10436,that roy wasn t going to get all worked up over things that were only externals was something uncle julian seemed capable of understanding,well he d say opening the door to his nephew in the evenings look who s here slob but smiling not like roy s father whom all through the army his son had remembered most vividly as he used to see him coming out of mr,roth
10437,10438,brunn s hair combed slick mouth shut tall and straight as an wearing that damn gray denim apron like the town cobbler,after he had come home from world war ii julian had sat down to figure out what people needed that would be cheap and helpful to them and profitable to himself he had come up with the idea of the laundromat,roth
10439,10440,so simple and yet within a year the quarters and half dollars that the ladies in the towns along the river dropped into the washers and driers of the elene laundromatic company left julian twenty thousand dollars to himself,now roy had no particular desire to follow in the footsteps of a businessman it was not only personal considerations that caused him to hesitate before julian s offer to teach him the business there was a matter of principle involved,roth
10441,10442,roy didn t know if he still believed the way he used to in free enterprise at least as practiced in this country,during his last few months up in the aleutians roy had listened from his sack when some of the college graduates in his barracks had their serious discussions at night about world affairs,roth
10443,10444,he himself didn t say much then and there but often on the following day he would find occasion while sitting around the motorpool office where he was supply clerk to talk over some of the things he had heard with sergeant hickey,to be sure he didn t swallow everything this lingelbach said that was critical of america,roth
10445,10446,sergeant hickey was perfectly right anybody could make destructive criticisms anybody could just go ahead and start knocking things left and right all day long to sergeant hickey s way of thinking if you didn t have something constructive to say then maybe you shouldn t say anything at all especially if you happened to be wearing the uniform and eating the chow and drawing the pay check of the country you thought was so terrible and awful,roy agreed that sergeant hickey was perfectly right there were some guys in the world who would never be satisfied even if you fed them all day long with a silver spoon but still you had to give this guy from boston not lingelbach who was an outright loner and oddball but bellwood a lot of credit for his arguments about the way they did things in sweden,roth
10447,10448,roy agreed right down the line with sergeant hickey and his uncle julian about communism but as bellwood said socialism was as different from communism as day from night,and sweden wasn t even that socialistic,roth
10449,10450,what had made roy begin to wonder if after his discharge a person like himself might not be happy living in a place like sweden was they had a high standard of living and it was a real democracy with the four freedoms but they weren t moneymad bellwood said the way people in america were which wasn t a criticism it was a fact and they didn t believe in war which roy didn t believe in either,actually if he hadn t just returned from sixteen months in the aleutians he might have gone off and gotten himself a job as a deckhand aboard a freighter bound for sweden and once there found some kind of good honest work and not in stockholm either but in some fishing village such as he had seen photographs of in holiday,roth
10451,10452,he might even have settled down there and married a swedish girl and had swedish children and never have returned to the united states again,wouldn t that be something,roth
10453,10454,to think if that was what he wanted he could pick up and do it and without explaining himself to anyone however for the time being he d really had his fill of the sun coming up at ten am,and going down practically at noon and the rest of what should be day being night,roth
10455,10456,probably that s what got to the swedes something did,sergeant hickey who saw all the magazines before they were put in the day room came into the office one morning and announced that in the new issue of look it said that more people jump off of buildings in sweden than in any outandout capitalistic country in the world,roth
10457,10458,when roy later brought this up with bellwood he didn t really have much to say in sweden s defense except to start quibbling over percentages,apparently there was a heck of a lot of gloom over there that bellwood hadn t mentioned and very frankly for all roy s willingness to sympathize with their form of government so long as it was a democracy with free elections by and large he would prefer at the end of a day s work to spend his leisure time with people who knew how to relax and take it easy,roth
10459,10460,moderation in all things that was his motto,consequently he found that he would just as soon spend his evenings at the sowerbys as hang around at home where he either had to keep the radio at a whisper because his father was upstairs writing some report for mr,roth
10461,10462,brunn or else his father was downstairs and they were discussing something called roy s future as though it were a body he had found on the front lawn now look here roy what do you intend to do with it,as for lloyd bassart s disapproval of roy s nightly social call over to the sowerbys and of his brotherinlaw julian as an influence and confidant he disguised his real objections by saying that he didn t feel roy should make himself a permanent fixture in another family s house simply because they had a television set,roth
10463,10464,roy said why should his father mind if the sowerbys themselves didn t,uncle julian was interested in what the postwar army was like and in what the younger generation was thinking and so he liked to talk to roy,roth
10465,10466,what was so wrong with that,however the talks between julian and roy consisted as frequently as not of julian s pulling roy s leg,roth
10467,10468,julian got a kick out of kidding roy and roy got sort of a kick out of being kidded since it really put them on a buddy relationship,of course sometimes julian went too far with his kidding particularly the night roy had said he really didn t think he could ever be satisfied as a human being unless he was doing something creative,roth
10469,10470,as it happened he was only repeating something he had once heard bellwood say but it applied equally as well to him even though he hadn t thought it up personally,uncle julian however chose deliberately to miss the point and said it sounded to him as though what roy needed was a good piece,roth
10471,10472,roy had laughed it off and tried to act nonchalant even though his aunt irene was in the dining room where she could hear every word they said,julian s sense of humor wasn t always up roy s alley,roth
10473,10474,it was one thing if you were in the barracks or the motorpool office to say f this and f that and another when there were women around,where uncle julian s language was concerned roy felt his father had his strongest case,roth
10475,10476,and then sometimes julian got his goat with his opinions on art which were totally uninformed,it wasn t the security angle he wanted roy to think about before going off to some ladeeda art school it was the sissy angle,roth
10477,10478,since when did you become a lollipop roy,though uncle julian was just a couple of inches over five feet he had been an infantry officer during the war and had nearly had his left ball shot off more times than he could count,roth
10479,10480,and even though he said it just that way regardless of the age or sex of anyone listening you had to admire him because it was the pure truth,the guy who had called out nuts to the enemy had gotten all the publicity at the time but apparently julian had been known throughout the division as up yours sowerby more than once that was the message he had shouted back to the germans when another man would have withdrawn or even surrendered,roth
10481,10482,he had risen to the rank of major and been awarded a silver star even lloyd bassart took his hat off to him on that score and had invited him to address the student body of the high school when he returned from the war,roy remembered it yet uncle julian had used hell and damn twelve times in the first five minutes according to a count kept by lloyd bassart but fortunately thereafter simmered down and when he was finished the students had risen to their feet and sung as the caissons go rolling along in his honor,roth
10483,10484,julian called roy you long drink of water and you big lug and slats and joe slob and hardly ever just roy,sometimes his nephew had no sooner stepped into the foyer than julian had his fists up and was dancing back into the living room saying come on come on and land one roy who had learned in gym class how to throw a onetwo punch though he had not yet had occasion to use it in the outside world would come after julian openhanded leading with his right while uncle julian would bob and weave cuffing aside the one before roy could deliver the two,roth
10485,10486,roy would circle and circle looking in vain for his opening and never failed to would cock back his right arm cry ya and even as roy was ducking his chin behind his fists and hiding his belly back of his elbows just as he had been taught in high school julian would already be swinging one leg around sideways to give his nephew a quick soft boot in the behind with the toe of his bedroom slipper,to adjust back to civilian life at the drop of a hat,roth
10487,10488,roy s father had been too young for world war i and too old for world war ii and so the whole business of being a veteran was just one more aspect of modern life that he couldn t get into his head,that a person s values might have changed after two years of military service didn t seem to mean anything to him,roth
10489,10490,that a person might actually benefit from a breather in which he got a chance to talk over some of what he had learned to digest it didn t strike him as anything but a waste of precious time,he really made roy s blood boil,roth
10491,10492,julian on the other hand was willing to listen,oh he made plenty of suggestions too but there was a little difference between somebody making a suggestion and somebody giving you an order,roth
10493,10494,so all through that fall and into the winter julian listened and then one evening in march while he and roy were smoking cigars and watching the milton berle show roy suddenly began during the commercial to say that he was starting to think that maybe his father was right that all this valuable time was just slipping through his fingers like water itself,you re twenty years old,roth
10495,10496,you re a twentyyearold kid,twenty long it won t last forever,roth
10497,10498,for christ s sake live it up a little have a good time get off your own back,every once in a while he would stop and sit up on the fender with his knees to his chest swinging a coke bottle back and forth in front of his eyes,roth
10499,10500,the war hero is thinking about his future eleanor would say and the very idea caused her to snort out loud,roy however appeared to pay no attention to either of them even when eleanor rapped on the window and ducked away,roth
10501,10502,as the weather grew warmer he would sometimes be seen slouched down in the back of the hudson his legs thrown up over the front seat reading a book he had taken out of the library,ellie would call out the window roy where in sweden are you going to live to which his answer would generally be a loud slam of the rear door of the car,roth
10503,10504,roy s reading all about sweden,half the farmers around here came running from there,roth
10505,10506,she did not take offense because her own grandfather who had been a farmer had come from norway,well i hope he goes somewhere ellie said,roth
10507,10508,my father s worried he s liable to decide to move in with us,the only time that he appeared to experience the girls as alive was down in the living room when he wouldn t move his legs so much as half an inch and the two had to step over him to get out through the french doors to the back lawn,roth
10509,10510,generally he acted as though teams had been chosen himself and his uncle julian on one and the two girls and mrs,sowerby on the other,roth
10511,10512,but if there were such sides lucy nelson had no sense that irene sowerby was on hers,though mrs,roth
10513,10514,sowerby was polite and hospitable to her face lucy was almost certain that behind her back the woman disapproved of who and what she was,the very first time ellie had brought her home mrs,roth
10515,10516,sowerby had called lucy dear right off the bat and a week later ellie was no longer her friend,she disappeared from her life as unexpectedly as she had come into it and the person responsible was irene sowerby lucy was sure,roth
10517,10518,because of what she knew about lucy s family or because of whatever she had heard about lucy herself mrs,sowerby had decided that she was not the kind of girl she wanted ellie bringing home in the afternoons,roth
10519,10520,that was in september of senior year,in february as if four months of conduct not quite becoming so refined a young lady hadn t intervened ellie slid a note all cheery and intimate into lucy s locker and after school they were walking together up to the grove,roth
10521,10522,of course lucy should have left her own note in return no thank you,you may be insensitive to the feelings of others but you are not going to be insensitive to mine and get away with it,roth
10523,10524,but that was not really eleanor s fault as much as it was her own or so she seemed willing to believe as she reread the note scrawled across the blue stationery monogrammed ees at the top,the reason she should have nothing to do with ellie sowerby was because she was ellie s superior in every way imaginable except for looks which she didn t care that much about and money which meant nothing and clothes and boys,roth
10525,10526,but just as she had known ellie to be her inferior and had gone off with her when invited back for a second afternoon in september so in the last week of february she followed along once again,where else was there to go,roth
10527,10528,home,as of february she had only two hundred more days to live in that house with those people times twentyfour is four thousand eight hundred hundred of them in bed however and then she would be down in the new fort kean branch of the women s state college,roth
10529,10530,she had applied for one of the fifteen full honors scholarships available to instate students and though daddy will said that to have received anything at all was an honor she had been awarded only what the letter of congratulation called a living aid scholarship covering the yearly dorm bill of one hundred and eighty dollars,she would be graduating twentyninth in a class of one hundred and seventeen and now she wished that she had worked and slaved for a s in those courses like latin and physics where she had felt it a real victory to get even a bminus,roth
10531,10532,not that financial difficulties were going to prevent her going off to school,over the years her mother had somehow managed to save two thousand dollars for lucy s education this plus lucy s own eleven hundred dollars in savings plus the living aid scholarship would see her through four years provided she continued to work full time at the dairy bar in the summers and was careful about spending on extras,roth
10533,10534,what disappointed her was that she had wanted to go off completely independent of them as of september she had hoped to have to rely upon them for nothing more for the rest of her life,almost into the fifth grade she had thought it made her rather special to be the daughter of mrs,roth
10535,10536,nelson the piano teacher then all at once the kids waiting on the porch in warm weather or sitting on their coats in the hallway in winter were her own that fact caused her to be filled with a kind of dread,no matter how fast she ran home from school no matter how silently she tried to make it into the house there would always be some child already at the piano invariably a boy who invariably would turn his head away from his lesson in time to catch sight of his classmate lucy nelson scooting up the stairs to her room,roth
10537,10538,at school she came to be known not as the kid whose mother gives the piano lessons but the kid whose father hangs around earl s that she was sure though the division she now sensed between herself and her schoolmates was such that it did not permit her to ask what they actually thought or to learn what it was they really did say behind her back,she pretended of course that hers was a normal household even after she had begun to realize it was after her mother s pupils went back out into town to spread the story of what lucy nelson s family was really like,roth
10539,10540,of course when she was small she was nearly able to believe it when she told her friends that it was actually her grandparents who lived with them in their house and not the other way around,right off she told new friends that why she couldn t bring anyone home in the afternoon was because her grandmother whom she loved dearly had to take her nap then,roth
10541,10542,and she had new friends often,there was a period when every girl her age who moved to town heard from lucy about her grandmother s nap,roth
10543,10544,but then a new girl named mary beckley whose family moved on again the following year began to giggle at the story and lucy knew that somebody had already cornered mary beckley and told her lucy s secrets,and from then on she refused ever to tell a lie again to anyone about anything from then on she brought no one to her home and did not offer explanations for her behavior either,roth
10545,10546,so from the age of ten though she had no friend who was her confidante nobody she cared about ever saw her mother taking from her students the little envelopes of money and saying thank you very much so very very sweetly or what was far worse the dread of dreads saw her father coming through the front door and falling down drunk in the hall,not even kitty egan whom she discovered in her second year of high school and who for four months was as intimate a companion as lucy had ever had,roth
10547,10548,kitty didn t go to liberty center high but to the parish school of st,mary s,roth
10549,10550,lucy had just started working four nights a week at the dairy bar and she met kitty because of the scandal kitty s older sister babs who was only seventeen had run away from home,she hadn t even waited until friday when the girls at the dairy bar were paid but had taken flight after work on a rainy tuesday night probably still in her waitress uniform,roth
10551,10552,her accomplice was an eighteenyearold boy who swept up at the packing company and came from selkirk,a post card addressed to the slaves at dale s dairy bar and mailed from aurora illinois had arrived in town at the end of the week,roth
10553,10554,headed for west virginia,keep up the good work kids and signed mrs,roth
10555,10556,she was a tall skinny girl whose most striking feature was the absence of any complexion she had no more coloring than the inside of a potato even when she came in out of the cold,at first she seemed as unlike babs as she could be until lucy learned that babs had dyed her hair black so as to look like linda darnell it had originally been orange like kitty s as for her skin babs caked it in so much mud kitty said you would never know that actually she was part anemic,roth
10557,10558,the family had always had their troubles with babs,the only satisfaction she gave them was to wear crucifix earrings in her pierced ears and a cross around her neck and that kitty said was only to draw attention to the space between her was the only real thing there anyway the space,roth
10559,10560,the breasts were things like toilet paper or her brother francis socks that she stuffed into her brassiere,babs wasn t five minutes away from st,roth
10561,10562,mary dark brick building just by the winnisaw she would duck into some alleyway to cover herself with pancake makeup from the roots of her dyed hair to the tops of her homemade breasts all the while puffing a lucky strike cigarette,kitty told lucy about the terrible thing she had once found in her sister s then i found this terrible thing once in her purse when babs discovered that kitty had flushed it down the toilet she screamed and yelled and struck her in the face,roth
10563,10564,kitty never told the fear that her parents would severely punish her older sister who she said needed mercy and forgiveness and love,babs was a sinner and knew not what she was doing and kitty loved her and every morning and every night she prayed for her sister living down there in west virginia with a boy who kitty believed was not even her husband,roth
10565,10566,there were three more children at home all younger than kitty and she prayed for them too especially for francis jr who was soon to have an operation for his mastoidistis the egans lived out near the maurer dairy farm where mr,egan worked in a house that was nothing more than a dilapidated old shack,roth
10567,10568,there were nails poking out of the timbers and flypaper dangling though it was already fall and every unpainted twobyfour seemed to have its decoration of exposed wire,lucy upon entering was afraid to move for fear of brushing up against something that would cause her to feel even more nausea and more despair than came from simply seeing the place where kitty had to eat and sleep and do her homework,roth
10569,10570,and when kitty said that in the afternoons her mother had to take a nap lucy was afraid to ask why knowing that behind such a lie there could only be some dreadful truth she did not want to hear she wanted only to get outside into the air and so thinking that the door nearest her led to the yard she pushed against it,in a tiny room asleep on a double bed lay a pale woman in a long gray cotton slip wearing on her left bed crippled person s shoe,roth
10571,10572,then she was introduced to francis jr who instantly showed her the spot where he appeared to have been whacked with a stick behind the ear,and joseph aged eight whom kitty had to take into the house to change out of his overalls which as usual kitty wet,roth
10573,10574,and tiny for the just dragged his sleeping blanket around and around the backyard crying for someone named fay who kitty said didn t even exist,and then mr,roth
10575,10576,egan appeared whom lucy might even have liked for his big lumbering stride and his blazing green eyes had not kitty earlier pointed to something hanging from a nail in the rear of an open shed which she whispered was a cato ninetails,in all it was the most wretched and unhappy family lucy had ever seen heard of or imagined if possible it was worse even than her own,roth
10577,10578,she and kitty began to meet regularly after school,lucy standing in the park across the street from st,roth
10579,10580,mary s would watch the catholic kids rushing out the side doors and imagine them all going back to houses just like kitty egan s even though the old snyders who were catholics and lived three doors down on franklin street owned a house almost exactly like her daddy will s,lucy told kitty her secret,roth
10581,10582,they walked down to the south end of water street and from a safe distance she pointed out the door to earl s dugout of buddies,he s working,roth
10583,10584,at least he is supposed to be,oh it s awful,roth
10585,10586,it s horrible,even though the weather had begun to turn and the days to grow dim by late afternoon the two girls would sit on a bench in the little park across from st,roth
10587,10588,mary s huddled close together in their coats while kitty read to lucy passages that she said would change her whole life and get her into heaven for all eternity,in the beginning lucy could not seem to get the hang of it,roth
10589,10590,she listened attentively sometimes with her eyes closed so as to concentrate better but soon it began to seem that not being a catholic she was fated never to understand whatever it was that so inspired kitty,she herself was lutheran on one side and presbyterian on the other and the latter had been her church back when her mother had been able to get her to go,roth
10591,10592,a kind of melancholy about her spiritual stupidity slowly settled upon her until one day despising both herself and her narrow protestant background she looked over kitty s shoulder at a page of the mysterious book and discovered that it wasn t hard to understand at all,it was only that in reading aloud suddenly seemed to her so hopelessly so disgustingly a for the and he for she and what for when and left out entirely those words she couldn t pronounce or changed them into others,roth
10593,10594,still kitty loved saint teresa as lucy had never loved anything at least that she could remember and so gradually when she began to get the drift of saint teresa s meaning and saw again and again how it flooded kitty with joy to pronounce aloud those very words nearly all of which saint teresa herself had written she began to wonder if perhaps she shouldn t forgive kitty egan her reading problem and try to love saint teresa too,it was kitty who brought her to meet father damrosch,roth
10595,10596,she began to take instruction from him for an hour after school two days a week and to spend still other hours in the church lighting endless candles to saint teresa after whose life she and kitty were going to model their own,at her first retreat she was given a black veil to keep by sister angelica of the passion a dark little woman with shiny skin and rimless spectacles and hair beneath her nose that so resembled a man s mustache that lucy said nothing of it for fear of offending kitty who adored sister angelica and didn t even seem to notice the long black hairs,roth
10597,10598,kitty had told sister angelica about lucy in a letter and so the sister knew all about lucy s father for whom she had already prayed at kitty s request,sister angelica was also praying for babs in west virginia,roth
10599,10600,in vain however did they all wait for news from the vanished sinner,it was as though she had stepped directly from that restaurant in aurora illinois into hell itself,roth
10601,10602,kitty and lucy would read aloud to each other their favorite passages from saint teresa who had left this fallen world at twentyfour a gruesome death of weakness cold coughing and blood,after calling upon saint teresa of lisieux and our getting no called the police,roth
10603,10604,father damrosch did not choose to call upon her himself when she who usually attended at least two failed to show up at a single mass that sunday nor when she did not appear the following week for her instruction,instead he apparently arranged for kitty to be excused early from school one day so as to meet lucy outside the high school which recessed each afternoon thirty minutes before st,roth
10605,10606,mary s,kitty said that father damrosch knew about lucy s father spending the night in jail,roth
10607,10608,kitty said that this was only another reason for her to hurry and be converted,she was sure that if lucy asked father damrosch would see her an extra hour a week and rush the conversion along so that she could be taking her first communion within a month,roth
10609,10610,jesus will forgive you lucy kitty said whereupon lucy turned in anger and said that she did not see that she had anything for which to be forgiven,kitty begged and begged and finally when lucy told her stop following me,roth
10611,10612,you don t know anything kitty began to weep and said she was going to write sister angelica so that she too would pray for lucy to embrace the teachings of the church before it was too late,she feared for a while that she would run into father damrosch downtown,roth
10613,10614,he was a big burly man with a mop of black hair who liked to kick the soccer ball around with the catholic boys after school,his voice and his looks made girls who were even protestant swoon openly in the street,roth
10615,10616,he and lucy had had such serious discussions during which she had tried so hard to believe the things he said,this life is not our real life and she had tried with all her might to believe him how had he found out so quickly what had happened,roth
10617,10618,how did everybody know,at school kids she hardly recogized had begun to say hi as though it had been discovered she were dying of some dread disease and everybody had been told to be nice in the few weeks remaining to her,roth
10619,10620,and after school a group of hideous boys who hung out smoking back of the billboard shouted after her hey gang busters and then imitated a machine gun firing,after they had kept at it for a whole week she picked up a stone one afternoon turned suddenly around and threw it so hard that it left a dark mark where it struck against the billboard,roth
10621,10622,but the boys only continued to jeer at her from where they had fled into a vacant lot,at home she continued to insist upon eating by herself in the kitchen rather than with him whom her grandfather had gone down and taken out of jail the very next morning,roth
10623,10624,if the phone beside the table rang while she sat looking angrily at her food she prayed that it would be father damrosch,what would her grandmother do when the priest announced himself,roth
10625,10626,but he never did,she even thought of going directly to to ask his help or his advice but because she recognized one of the boys who called her gang busters from seeing him at nine o clock mass with his family every sunday,roth
10627,10628,however she would let father damrosch know right off she had nothing to be forgiven for and nothing to confess,who was kitty egan even to suggest such a thing,roth
10629,10630,a homely backward girl from an illiterate family whose clothes smelled like fried potatoes and who couldn t read a sentence from a book without getting it all balled up,who was she to tell lucy anything,roth
10631,10632,and as for saint teresa that little flower the truth was lucy couldn t stand her suffering little guts,she gathered together her black veil her rosary her catechism her copy of story of a soul and all the pamphlets she had accumulated at the retreat and from the vestibule at st,roth
10633,10634,mary s and put them into a brown paper bag,what prevented her from simply dropping the items separately into the bottom of her wastebasket was the knowledge that her grandmother would see them there and think that it was because of her objections to all that catholic hocuspocus that lucy was giving up going into the church,roth
10635,10636,she did not wish her to have the satisfaction,what she decided to do about her religion or about anything relating to her personal life was the business of nobody in that house least of all that snoop,roth
10637,10638,she carried the paper bag with her to work that night intending to drop it into a garbage can along the way or toss it into a lot,but a rosary,roth
10639,10640,a veil,a crucifix,roth
10641,10642,suppose the bag was found and brought to father damrosch,what would he think then,roth
10643,10644,perhaps the only reason he had refrained from calling her so far was because he felt it improper to interfere in a family already so strongly opposed to conversion or perhaps he believed it improper to meddle in a private matter before his assistance had been asked for or perhaps he had sensed all along that lucy only half believed the things he told her and so would be immune to anything further he might have to say or perhaps he had never really been that interested in her to begin with thought of her as just another kid and if she came to him would only resume stuffing her full of catechism so as finally to stuff her into the confessional where like stupid kitty egan she could ask forgiveness for sins that were not really her own and say prayers for people that did them absolutely no good,he would try to teach her to learn to love to suffer,roth
10645,10646,but she hated suffering as much as she hated those who made her suffer and she always would,after work she hurried out broadway toward the river,roth
10647,10648,at st,mary s she entered without genuflecting placed the bag on the last bench and ran,roth
10649,10650,outside there was only one light on in the rectory was father damrosch standing behind one of the dark windows looking down at her,she gave him a moment to call for her to come inside,roth
10651,10652,and tell her what,this life is a prelude to the next,roth
10653,10654,she didn t believe it,there is no next life,roth
10655,10656,this is what there is father damrosch,this,roth
10657,10658,now,and they are not going to ruin it for me,roth
10659,10660,i will not let them,i am their superior in every single way,roth
10661,10662,people can call me all the names they don t care,i have nothing to confess because i am right and they are wrong and i will not be destroyed,roth
10663,10664,one night two weeks later father damrosch came into dale s dairy bar for a black and white ice cream soda,dale popped immediately out from the back to say hello and to serve the priest personally saying all the while what a great honor it was,roth
10665,10666,he refused to take father damrosch s money but the father insisted and when he left one of the waitresses said to lucy he s absolutely gorgeous but lucy only continued carefully refilling the sugar bowls,the very next term lucy took the music appreciation course where she was prevailed upon by the teacher mr,roth
10667,10668,valerio to become interested in the snare drum so for the next year and a half the problem of what to do after school was solved by band,either they were practicing in the auditorium or on the field or on saturdays were off and away to a football game,roth
10669,10670,there were always kids dashing in and out of bandroom or shoving from behind onto the bus or jamming together epaulet to epaulet in the band section to stay warm while the game lucy interminably on,as a result she was hardly ever alone around school to be pointed out as the kid who had done this or that terrible thing,roth
10671,10672,sometimes as she was rushing up out of the school basement with her drum she would see arthur mufflin slinking around the basketball courts or perched on his motorcycle smoking,he had been thrown out of winnisaw high years ago and was some kind of hero to the boys who used to call her gang busters and j,roth
10673,10674,edgar hoover but if he himself had any smart remarks to make she didn t wait to hear them,she would just start in practicing the marching cadence and continue all the way to the field beating it out so loud that whether he called to her or not she didn t even know,roth
10675,10676,but then altogether unexpectedly at the very start of her senior year band was over,she had cut practice twice in two weeks to go up with ellie sowerby to the grove to mr,roth
10677,10678,valerio she explained her first lie in years that her grandmother was ill and needed he had swallowed it,so there was no tension between them at all she was still his dream girl nor had the thrill gone out of marching up the field at the start of the afternoon guiding her line left left left right left and drumming out the muffled cadence till they reached the midfield stripe and launched into the national anthem,roth
10679,10680,it was the moment of the week she had come to live for but not because of anything so ridiculous as school even love of country which she supposed she had though no more than an ordinary person,it wasn t the flag snapping in the breeze that gave her the gooseflesh so much as the sight of everybody in the stands rising as it moved down the field,roth
10681,10682,she saw from the corner of her eye the arms sweep up the hats swept off and felt the drum thumpthumping softly against the guard on her leg and the warmth of the sun fell on her hair where it poked out from under her black and silver hat with the yellow plume and oh it was truly that third saturday in september when they turned at the midfield stripe to face the stands where everyone was silently standing facing them and she tightened her hold on the smooth sticks and mr,valerio climbed onto the folding chair that had been brought out to the field for him and he looked down at band he whispered smiling good afternoon then in the moment before he raised his baton she realized for no good reason at all that in the entire liberty center consolidated high school marching band there were only four girls eva petersen who played the clarinet and had a walleye the harpbell player marilynne elliott whose brother was a big hero but who herself stammered and the new frenchhorn player of whom mr,roth
10683,10684,valerio was so proud poor leola krapp who had that name and was only fourteen and already weighed two hundred stripped the boys said,and lucy,roth
10685,10686,on monday she told mr,valerio that working in dale s dairy bar at night and having band practice in the afternoons wasn t giving her time enough to study,roth
10687,10688,but we finish by fourthirty still she said looking away,but you managed last year lucy,roth
10689,10690,and on the honor roll i know,i m really sorry mr,roth
10691,10692,valerio well lucy he said you and bobby witty are my mainstays,i don t really know what to say,roth
10693,10694,the big games are just coming up i know mr,valerio but i think i have to,roth
10695,10696,i think i better,college is coming up too you know,roth
10697,10698,and so i really have to knuckle down and make an allout my scholarship,and i have to make the money at the dairy bar,roth
10699,10700,if i could quit that of course then i could have this but i just can t well he said lowering the lids of his big black eyes i don t know what s going to happen to the rhythm in that drum section,i hate even to think about it i think bobby can carry them mr,roth
10701,10702,valerio she said feebly,well he sighed i m not fritz reiner,roth
10703,10704,i suppose this is what they mean by a high school band i m really sorry mr,valerio it s just i don t often get a person boy or girl who is serious about the snare drum the way you are,roth
10705,10706,most of them if you ll pardon my language just beat the damn thing to death,you listen,roth
10707,10708,you ve been my dream girl lucy thank you mr,valerio,roth
10709,10710,i really appreciate that,that means a lot to me,roth
10711,10712,i sincerely mean that then she laid on his desk the box in which she had folded up her uniform,the silver hat with the black peak and the gold plume she carried in her hand,roth
10713,10714,i m really sorry mr,valerio he took the hat and put it on his desk,roth
10715,10716,valerio sat there flicking the plume on her hat with one finger,oh he was such a nice man,roth
10717,10718,he was a bachelor with a slight limp who had come to them all the way from a music school in indianapolis indiana and his whole life was band,he was so patient and so dedicated he was either smiling or sad but never angry never mean and now she was letting him down and for a selfish stupid unimportant reason,roth
10719,10720,well so long mr,valerio,roth
10721,10722,he seemed to have collected himself,he took one of her hands in his two and shook it trying to look happy,roth
10723,10724,why was she doing this,band was her second home,roth
10725,10726,her first home,but mr,roth
10727,10728,valerio was saying i suppose we are all going to survive he clapped her on the shoulder,hi the child said,roth
10729,10730,whoever was already at the piano stopped in the middle of a bar as she slammed the door and took the stairs two at a time,as she turned the key in the bedroom door she heard the piano start up again downstairs,roth
10731,10732,instantly she pulled out her desk chair stood up on it and looked at her legs in the mirror over the dresser,they had hardly any shape she was just too short and too skinny,roth
10733,10734,but what could she do about that,she had been five one and a half now for two years and as for weight she didn t like to eat at least not at home,roth
10735,10736,besides if she got any heavier her legs would just get round like s what happened to short girls,she climbed down off the chair,roth
10737,10738,she looked at herself straight on in the mirror,her face was so boring,roth
10739,10740,the word pug had been invented to describe her nose,eva petersen had tried to give her that as a nickname in the band but lucy had told her to cut it out which she did instantly what with her own walleye,roth
10741,10742,a pug nose wasn t that bad actually except that where hers turned up at the end it was too thick,and so was her jaw for a girl at any rate,roth
10743,10744,her hair was a kind of yellowishwhite and she knew that bangs didn t help all that squareness any but when she lifted them up as she did now her forehead was so bony,well at least her eyes were would have been had they belonged to someone else though that was the trouble they did belong to someone else,roth
10745,10746,sometimes she used to look at the mirror in the bandroom and with her hat on she would be terrified by the resemblance she bore to her those two round blue stains beneath the steep pale brow,she had freckles too but no only physical blessing,roth
10747,10748,she stepped backward so as to see all of herself again,all she ever wore was that plaid skirt with the big safety pin in front and her gray sweater with the sleeves pushed up and her ratty loafers,roth
10749,10750,she had three other skirts but they were even older,and she didn t care about clothes,roth
10751,10752,why should she,oh why had she quit band,roth
10753,10754,she clutched at the back of her blouse so that it pulled tight across her front,her breasts had started growing when she was eleven then to her relief a year later they had just stopped,roth
10755,10756,but weren t they going to start again,she did know an exercise that supposedly could enlarge them,roth
10757,10758,the health teacher miss fichter had demonstrated it to them in class,it was out of american posture monthly a magazine with a picture on the cover of little twin boys in white briefs standing on their heads and smiling,roth
10759,10760,there was nothing there to cause giggling as far as miss fichter could see and that went for the exercise as well whose purpose was allaround health and attractiveness,if only they got into the habit of exercising their muscles when they were young they would always be proud of themselves physically,roth
10761,10762,too many teenage girls in this school slouch said miss fichter and she said it as though she really meant lie or steal,you did the exercise with your hands out in front of your chest first you pushed the right fist into the open left palm and then the left fist into the open right palm,roth
10763,10764,how long before it began to work,how she would miss mr,roth
10765,10766,valerio,but she simply couldn t march any more with those were freaks,roth
10767,10768,and she wasn t,and nobody was going to say she was either,roth
10769,10770,from now on it would just be her and eleanor sowerby together,in ellie s room was a bed with a white organdy canopy and a dressing table with a mirror top where they would do their homework on the afternoons when it rained on nice afternoons they would sit out in the back reading together in the sun or just walk around the grove doing nothing except looking at lawns and gabbing,roth
10771,10772,if by the time they got back it was dark most likely the sowerbys would invite her to join them for supper,on sundays they would ask her to come with them to church and stay on afterward for dinner,roth
10773,10774,mrs,sowerby was so softspoken and attentive she had called her dear the very afternoon they were which lucy had nearly idiotically responded with a curtsy,roth
10775,10776,and mr,sowerby had come noisily into the house at pappy yokum s home he d called and then had given his wife a loud wet kiss right on the mouth even though she was a plump woman with gray hair who ellie said had to wear rubber stockings to keep her veins in,roth
10777,10778,it was ellie s current joke to call him pappy yokum and his to call her daisy mae and silly as this struck her lucy had nonetheless found herself very much in awe of what appeared at last to be a happy family,so she quit band,roth
10779,10780,and ellie dumped her,oh hi there ellie would say as they passed in the corridors and then just keep walking,roth
10781,10782,for a week lucy was able to tell herself that ellie was only waiting for her to return the invitation,but how could she invite her home if she didn t even get a chance to talk to her,roth
10783,10784,and even if she was able to did she want to,one day after two solid weeks of being ignored she saw ellie sitting in the cafeteria at the same table with some of the shallowest and silliest girls in the entire school and so she thought to herself well if those are the kind of girls she really prefers et cetera et cetera,roth
10785,10786,then in late february she found the note slipped down through the air vents into her locker,hi stranger,roth
10787,10788,i ve been accepted at northwestern big deal so the pressure is off and i can relax now,meet me at the flagpole at threethirty please please,roth
10789,10790,this time lucy was far less impressionable,thinking back to september to the sheer idiocy of quitting band so as to be ellie sowerby s it was as though she had been ten years old,roth
10791,10792,she had really gone against every principle she had,it had been weak and stupid and childish and though in the interim she had despised ellie and plenty she had despised herself no less,roth
10793,10794,for one thing it was a matter of absolute indifference to her who lived in the was the truth,nothing used to infuriate her more than to take a drive with her family on sunday back when she was young enough to have to go where they wanted her to and have her mother point out the house up in the grove that her father had once almost bought,roth
10795,10796,as if where you lived or how much money you had was what was important and not the kind of human being you were,the sowerbys had a fulltime maid and a house and enough money to send a daughter off to a place like northwestern for four years but the fact remained that lucy nelson was still more of a person than their own daughter would ever be,roth
10797,10798,to ellie the biggest thing in life was clothes,outside of marshall s store in winnisaw lucy had never seen so many skirts in one place as ellie had hanging in her big walllength closet with the sliding doors,roth
10799,10800,some afternoons when it rained and they studied together in ellie s room exactly as she had imagined they would she looked up to discover the closet doors ajar whole minutes often passed before she was looking down into her book again trying to find her place,when the weather began to turn warm and by three o clock it was suddenly too hot for the coat that lucy had worn to school that morning ellie would tell her just to pull any old sweater out of the bureau drawer and wear it for the rest of the afternoon,roth
10801,10802,only there weren t any old sweaters in there,one afternoon the sweater she put on turned out to be one hundred percent cashmere,roth
10803,10804,she didn t realize this until out on the lawn she took a quick look at the label and went breathless at what she had done,by this time however ellie was calling for her to help pound in the croquet wickets and mrs,roth
10805,10806,sowerby had already seen her pass through the living room,and she had already seen the look of disapproval move across mrs,roth
10807,10808,sowerby s face at the first glimpse of the sagging plaid skirt coming down the stairs topped by ellie s lemoncolored sweater,have a good game mrs,roth
10809,10810,sowerby had said but that lucy realized too late wasn t at all what she had been thinking,to go back upstairs however to change the cashmere for cotton or even lamb s wool would be to admit that she was indeed guilty of choosing it deliberately when in actuality she had taken it in all innocence,roth
10811,10812,upon lifting it from the overstuffed drawer she had not thought cashmere she had only thought how soft,it had nothing to do with being covetous and she would not give credence to any such suspicion by traipsing all the way past mrs,roth
10813,10814,sowerby a second time,she had no intention of ever being made to feel inferior again not by ellie and not by any member of her family and that was the reason she gave herself for keeping the soft lemoncolored sweater on her back until the very minute that she changed back into her heavy winter coat and left for home,roth
10815,10816,shortly thereafter ellie trimmed her bangs for her,lucy kept saying not too much,roth
10817,10818,really,she didn t even respect ellie so where did she get off treating lucy like her stooge,roth
10819,10820,and she didn t respect ellie s parents that much any more either,what was mrs,roth
10821,10822,sowerby but a social snob,as for mr,roth
10823,10824,she hadn t figured him out yet,daddy will liked to crack corny jokes and her father used to think he was being funny when she was small and he called her goosie but mr,roth
10825,10826,sowerby was almost always joking and was almost always loud,whenever he was down in the living room lucy took her time going between ellie s bedroom and the bathroom at the end of the hall,roth
10827,10828,pike this he d call to his wife in the kitchen,just pike this and then at the top of his voice he would read from the newspaper something that harry truman had done which just infuriated him,roth
10829,10830,once he called irene come here irene and when she came into the living room he put a hand on her behind and said softly now but lucy frozen in the upper hallway could hear by holding her breath how s the health tootsie how could she approve of the way he talked to mrs,sowerby or the kind of language he used,roth
10831,10832,she certainly didn t believe that mrs,sowerby did what with all her airs,roth
10833,10834,she had the distinct feeling that all this hugging and kissing was something mrs,sowerby simply had to endure,roth
10835,10836,it almost made lucy feel sorry for her,on the other hand mr,roth
10837,10838,sowerby was liberty center s outstanding war hero,on his return to town the mayor had actually led a motorcade down to the train station to meet him,roth
10839,10840,lucy had only been a freshman when he came to the high school to talk but she remembered that his speech had left a sobering impression on the people in the community who had thought the worst was now over,his topic had been how to make this world a better place to live in as some of the boys referred to it afterward how the hell to make this god damn world a helluva better place to live it it was mostly about remaining vigilant in the coming years against what mr,roth
10841,10842,sowerby called the threat of atheistical communism,the very next day there had been an editorial on the front page of the winnisaw leader calling upon major sowerby to run for congress in the elections,roth
10843,10844,ellie said that he had decided not to only because her mother didn t feel it would have been right to take ellie out of her school once again if they had had to move to washington dc,because of the war she had already had to attend schools in north carolina and georgia which said ellie accounted for her sometimes falling into a southern accent without even realizing it,roth
10845,10846,ellie loved to tell how the governor had spoken to her father on the phone and how her father had said he didn t want the governor to think he was putting responsibility to family above responsibility to country and so on and so forth,the conversation came out different each time ellie reported it once it even occurred at the governor s mansion only the tone in which the story was told remained the same smug,roth
10847,10848,of course lucy appreciated ellie s generosity with her possessions and it was hard to say she wasn t goodnatured but one thing that was unforgivable was being condescended to,the day that ellie began to fuss with her clothes she got so furious that she wanted to leave right then and there and she would have too were it not that ellie had already unstitched the hem and was busy pinning up a new one and she herself was in her slip and blouse sitting at ellie s dressing table and looking out between the curtains at ellie s cousin the army veteran working on his hudson,roth
10849,10850,roy,she had never called him that or anything,roth
10851,10852,and he did not appear even to know her name or even to associate her with the girl who worked behind the counter at dale s dairy bar,between september when she had caught her first glimpse of him at eleanor s and february when grace had fallen upon her a second time she had observed him many times as he sat at the counter of the dairy bar sometimes she had seen him headed down broadway carrying his sketch pad,roth
10853,10854,during those months without band and without ellie when she used to hole herself up every afternoon in the public library there was a period of a few weeks when he always seemed to be coming out of the library just as she was going in,he was friendly with dale and once she d seen him talking seriously with miss bruckner the librarian,roth
10855,10856,so it wasn t shyness that explained his solitude he just seemed to prefer to be was one of the things that had begun to make her think that he might be an interesting person,also she knew who his father,roth
10857,10858,bassart who introduced the speakers at assembly programs and was known to be one of the strictest though one of the fairest teachers in the entire school,and she knew he had recently returned from serving two years in the army overseas,roth
10859,10860,ellie always made fun of him,he thinks he looks like dick haymes,roth
10861,10862,but i know him she would add ominously,then out the window roy sing like dick haymes,roth
10863,10864,come on lucy never heard your imitations,do vaughan monroe roy,roth
10865,10866,you really look more like him anyway now that you re so mature,sing ballerina roy,roth
10867,10868,what he was doing the times she saw him meandering slowly down broadway whacking his sketch pad against his thigh or on the evenings when he sat at the dairy bar counter rattling the ice round and round at the bottom of his coke or on the weekends he spent sunk down into the club chair talking with his uncle julian was trying to decide just what to do with his life,he was at a genuine turning point that was the expression she had heard him using one saturday,roth
10869,10870,and it had stayed with her,what was roy going to become,roth
10871,10872,an artist,a businessman,roth
10873,10874,or was he going to ship out and really give sweden a chance,or would he do something completely bizarre and unpredictable,roth
10875,10876,once she heard him remind his uncle that he didn t only have the gi,bill he had a gi,roth
10877,10878,home loan too,if he wanted to he could actually go off and buy a house of his own and then live in it,roth
10879,10880,his uncle julian laughed but roy said poopoo my ideas all you want kiddo but it s true,not roy i hope ellie said,roth
10881,10882,i was just looking outside ellie she said coldly,because don t waste your breath on that one said ellie biting the thread,roth
10883,10884,roy s major interest these days is sex,or so he says,roth
10885,10886,he said to me is she a kid or has she got a brain in her head,otherwise i don t want to waste my time i said don t worry roy,roth
10887,10888,she s no kid so he said what is that supposed to mean and i said i know why you like her roy and he got all red in the face,i mean everybody knows her reputation,roth
10889,10890,ellie went on,i said it isn t her personality that makes her popular roy so he said well that s all i asked ellie whether she even had a personality or not well ask bill elliott about her personality roy if you haven t already so he said i didn t even know she went out with him not any more roy,roth
10891,10892,even he doesn t respect her any more,i ll leave the rest to your imagination i said and then you know what he said,roth
10893,10894,go play with your jacks ellie he tells my father all his big sex exploits in the army and daddy lets him which he shouldn t either,roy i mean ellie added,roth
10895,10896,by april the elastic at the top of roy s army socks had begun to unravel,every time the two girls stepped over excuse us cousin will you please said saw between the shrunken fading khaki trousers and the drooping socks the white and slender part of his leg,roth
10897,10898,at the beginning of the month a week of hot wonderful summery weather swept across the middle west pushing into bloom almost overnight the forsythia in the sowerby garden one afternoon just as she stepped to ellie s bedroom window to take a quick look the new began pulling his tshirt off over his head,in only a matter of seconds she had turned back to ellie who was searching a drawer for an old pair of shorts for lucy to wear but the sight of his long smooth cylindrical upper half stretching down over the open hood of his car remained in her mind all afternoon,roth
10899,10900,near the end of the month when roy bought the camera and began to get the photography magazines he came to eleanor and said that he wanted to do some studies in black and white down by the landing,he needed a girl to sit under the tree he d picked out,roth
10901,10902,it might just as well be ellie,ellie s color rose she had auburn hair that shone and hazel eyes that changed sometimes to catgray and in repose she was not only one of the prettiest girls lucy had ever seen but also looked altogether poised and intelligent,roth
10903,10904,she could easily have passed for nineteen or twenty and she knew it,look roy she said dropping into her southern accent why don t youall get monkey littlefield,roth
10905,10906,probably she ll even do cheesecake fo ya,i want to do this study,roth
10907,10908,so say either yes or no,sex to his own family,roth
10909,10910,they drove off to the river,lucy came along for the ride,roth
10911,10912,that was how roy had extended the invitation when she said that she d better go home,you can come for the ride if you want,roth
10913,10914,i don t charge anything the while using a little pressure gauge he had bought to check the air in a front tire that he said looked to him to be low,he posed his subject because that s all she was and he hoped she could understand what that meant by the big oak near the old pier,roth
10915,10916,ellie kept wanting to look off in profile toward winnisaw but roy wanted her looking straight up into the tree,every few shots or so he came over and yanked on one of the branches so as to get the shadows to fall in the right places,roth
10917,10918,the whole idea ellie is the marvel of spring,one he turned all around,roth
10919,10920,well where d she disappear to,hey roy called want your picture taken,roth
10921,10922,no she said,lucy come on eleanor called,roth
10923,10924,who said that he wanted to know,she likes you ellie whispered,roth
10925,10926,now who told you that eleanor,one,roth
10927,10928,she noticed that he did not refer to the light meter first,when the picture was developed he showed it to her,roth
10929,10930,she was heading down the sowerby drive for home when he came out of the house behind her,he trotted down the drive in a kind of loping pigeontoed run,roth
10931,10932,here he said,that evening he appeared at dale s dairy bar where she worked on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays from seven to ten and on fridays and saturdays from seven to eleventhirty,roth
10933,10934,he sat where she had to take his order a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato,when she put down the sandwich in front of him he said hey about this afternoon took a bite out of the i m sorry she went on about her business,roth
10935,10936,when finally she came back to ask if he would care for anything more he said it again as sincerely as he could and this time without a mouthful of food,pay the cashier she answered giving him his check,roth
10937,10938,you never do it she answered sharply and started away realizing that she had said the wrong thing,sure enough he followed her down the counter,roth
10939,10940,what a smile,from ear to ear,roth
10941,10942,i meant the picture was no good,look i don t lie he said when she did not respond,roth
10943,10944,i don t have to he said hitching up his trousers,he was parked outside at closing time,roth
10945,10946,she refused to accept a lift home,she did not even acknowledge the offer,roth
10947,10948,hey he said driving slowly along beside her i m only trying to be nice she turned off broadway up franklin and the car turned with her,he took hundreds of pictures of her,roth
10949,10950,once they spent a whole afternoon driving around the countryside in search of the right barn for her to stand in front of,he wanted one with a falling roof and a gloomy air and all they could find were big red ones freshly painted,roth
10951,10952,once he made her stand in front of a white cement wall by the high school in the full noon light so that her bangs looked like white straw and her blue eyes like the eyes in a statue and the bones of her square serious face appeared to be stone beneath her skin,he told her practically every day that she had fantastic planes in her face and that she was a far better subject than someone like ellie who was all glamour and no substance,roth
10953,10954,he said girls like ellie were a dime a look at the magazines,her face had character in it,roth
10955,10956,every afternoon he picked her up at school at threethirty and they went off on one of their photographic expeditions,and at night he was parked outside the dairy bar waiting to drive her home,roth
10957,10958,at least that was where he drove her the first week,when he asked one night about coming inside awhile she said absolutely no,roth
10959,10960,to her relief he did not ask again once she had consented to drive with him out beyond the grove to the wooded bluff that overlooked the river which was called picnic paradise by the winnisaw county park commission and passion paradise by the high school kids,there roy would turn off the lights flip on the radio and try with all his might to get her to go all the way,roth
10961,10962,roy i want to leave now,stop,roth
10963,10964,i m only asking you to trust me,just trust me he said trying once again to put his fingers between the buttons of her uniform,roth
10965,10966,not if you don t fight,you say that and when i do then you only start going further,roth
10967,10968,oh lucy he said,not there she cried for on arms he had sunk an elbow into her lap as though by accident,roth
10969,10970,she said that if that was all he was interested in each and every night she did not think they should see each other ever again,he said that it wasn t all he was interested in but he was a grown man and he hadn t thought she was going to turn out to be just another kid who didn t know what life was all about,roth
10971,10972,he hadn t thought she was going to turn out to be like ellie a professional ct if she knew what that was,she didn t and he said he had too much respect for her to tell her,roth
10973,10974,the whole point was that he wouldn t even have started up in the first place with a girl he couldn t respect nor would he have invited her out in the car if he didn t think she was mature enough to handle some ordinary premarital petting,she said petting was one thing and what he wanted was something else,roth
10975,10976,he said he would even settle for petting if she would just relax she said that as soon as she started to relax he stopped settling,she said she wasn t monkey littlefield he said well then maybe that was just too bad for her and she said well then go back to her if that s what you re really after and he said maybe i will,roth
10977,10978,and so the next afternoon when she came out of school the car wasn t there,ellie wasn t waiting for her either she had stopped weeks ago once roy got involved with lucy on his aspects of an angel series,roth
10979,10980,lucy didn t know what to do with herself,again nowhere to go,roth
10981,10982,that night she was walking home from the dairy bar when a car pulled up alongside her,hey lucy he blew the horn and pulled over to the curb,roth
10983,10984,hey it s me,hop in he said throwing open the door,roth
10985,10986,no,i want to go home,roth
10987,10988,without a golden wand or mystic charms he sang,she resisted his gentle tug on the back of the neck so he bent his face toward her closed mouth and wideopen eyes,roth
10989,10990,angel he said,you sound like a movie when you say that,roth
10991,10992,you can at least move over for the time being he said,well will you move over please,roth
10993,10994,angel he whispered,oh angel,roth
10995,10996,he did not fall away until the record was over then with a sigh,he waited to hear what the next song would be,roth
10997,10998,don t fight me lucy he whispered stroking her hair,don t it s not worth it and along with margaret whiting he began to sing there s a tree in the meadow with a stream drifting by and to move his hand up under her slip,roth
10999,11000,don t he said when she began to struggle,trust me,roth
11001,11002,i won t go any higher,come on lucy,roth
11003,11004,they continued kissing,see he said after several minutes had passed,roth
11005,11006,did i move it,calm down,roth
11007,11008,i m sorry,i love this roy said,roth
11009,11010,it s just out,it s really got a great message,roth
11011,11012,that s right i m lying down,why shouldn t i,roth
11013,11014,you said you d take me home,boy no wonder you and ellie are friends,roth
11015,11016,you re a real team he mumbled something she couldn t understand,right,roth
11017,11018,we sat in the back,so then don t let it this time he said,roth
11019,11020,look lucy and he sat up and tried to take hold of her head which she pulled away,i respect what you want you know that,roth
11021,11022,but all you want to do he said slumping backward is to get your picture taken and get driven home at night and what the other person feels well i happen to feel something,roy threw open the back door so violently that it careened on its hinges,roth
11023,11024,get in he whispered,in the back he told her how much he could love her,roth
11025,11026,he was pulling at her uniform buttons,everybody says things like that when they want what you want roy,roth
11027,11028,stop,please stop,roth
11029,11030,i don t want to do this,honestly,roth
11031,11032,he kept saying please and she kept saying please and she could hardly breathe or move he was over her with all his weight and saying now don t fight me i could love you angel angel trust me and suddenly into her mind came the name babs egan,stop,roth
11033,11034,roy stop that she screamed,oh damn it he said and sat up and allowed her to pull her legs out from under him,roth
11035,11036,she looked out the window at her side the glass had fogged over,she was afraid to look over at him,roth
11037,11038,she didn t know whether his trousers were just down or completely off,she could hardly speak,roth
11039,11040,i m a human being,that s what i mean,roth
11041,11042,and i don t want to do it anyway,roy get back in front,roth
11043,11044,dress yourself,take me home,roth
11045,11046,you had me trapped,i didn t want anything,roth
11047,11048,and you weren t even going be careful,are you absolutely insane,roth
11049,11050,no,well i didn t get i,roth
11051,11052,take me home,they were always on,roth
11053,11054,darn it you don t even know what i went through today,all you know is your own way that s all,roth
11055,11056,boy you are another ct,i respect you,roth
11057,11058,doesn t that mean anything to you at all,you know where i was this afternoon,roth
11059,11060,i ll tell you where and i m not ashamed it happened to involve respect for you,for almost an hour he had waited outside forester s for mrs,roth
11061,11062,forester to go upstairs and leave her goofy old husband alone at the counter,but once roy got inside it turned out that mrs,roth
11063,11064,forester had only gone back into the storeroom and she was up by the register ready to wait on him before he could even turn around and walk out,so what could i do,roth
11065,11066,i bought a pack of blackjack gum,and a tin of anacin,roth
11067,11068,well what else was i supposed to do,in every store in town my father s name is a household word,roth
11069,11070,every place i go it s hi roy how s gi,joe and people see me with you lucy,roth
11071,11072,i mean they know we re going together you know,so who would they think it was for,roth
11073,11074,don t you think i think about that,there s your reputation to consider too don t you think,roth
11075,11076,what really did she want him to do,to have bought one of those things,roth
11077,11078,he certainly wasn t going to use it on her,she wasn t going to let him plan what he was going to do to her hours in advance and then act as though the whole thing was the passion of the moment,roth
11079,11080,she wasn t going to be used or tricked or be treated like some street tramp either,but you were overseas she was saying,roth
11081,11082,the aleutians,the aleutian islands the bering sea from the ussr,roth
11083,11084,do you know what the motto is up there,a woman behind every tree there are no trees,roth
11085,11086,get it,what do you think i did up there,roth
11087,11088,i made out order forms all day,i played eighteen thousand pingpong games,roth
11089,11090,what s the matter with you he said sinking in disgust into the seat,overseas he said sourly,roth
11091,11092,i m twenty years old almost twentyone but that doesn t mean i go around doing it with every girl i see,i have to like the person first of all,roth
11093,11094,you listen to stupid ellie but ellie doesn t know what she s talking about,the reason lucy i don t take monkey littlefield out is because i don t happen to respect her,roth
11095,11096,if you want the truth,and i don t like her,roth
11097,11098,and i don t even know her,oh forget it,roth
11099,11100,let s just go let s just call it quits,he actually did like her,roth
11101,11102,he said people knew that they were going together,she hadn t realized,roth
11103,11104,she was going with roy bassart who was twenty and had been in the service,and people knew it,roth
11105,11106,in winnisaw she was saying,oh why was she going on and on with this subject,roth
11107,11108,even going into forester s on broadway is going too far as far as you re concerned,so what s the sense,roth
11109,11110,who am i kidding,myself,roth
11111,11112,i spent a whole afternoon hanging around outside waiting for that old hag to disappear and it wouldn t have made any difference anyway,you d only hate me worse,roth
11113,11114,right,so where does that leave me,roth
11115,11116,well what is it you want to say lucy,fine he threw open the back door on his side,roth
11117,11118,let s go home,i can t take any more of this really,roth
11119,11120,i happen to be a man and i happen to have certain physical needs as well as emotional needs you know and i don t have to take this from any high school kid,all we do is discuss every move i make step by step,roth
11121,11122,is that romantic to you,is that your idea of a manwoman relationship,roth
11123,11124,well it s not mine,sex is one of the highest experiences anybody can have man or woman physical or mental,roth
11125,11126,but you re just another one of those typical american girls who thinks it s obscene,well let s go typical american girl,roth
11127,11128,he was really and truly angry not like somebody who was trying to deceive you or trick you,well what s the matter now he asked,roth
11129,11130,really,you say love lucy said,roth
11131,11132,that s not a lie,i get carried away by the mood,roth
11133,11134,i like music so it affects me,he put his hand on her hair,roth
11135,11136,she felt as though she weren t there as though this were all happening a long time ago,just trust me he pleaded trust me trust me and alas she wanted to so badly she did,roth
11137,11138,a week before lucy s graduation the news arrived roy had been accepted at the britannia school of photography and design which had been established according to the catalogue and brochure in,they were delighted to enroll him for the september session they said and returned with the letter of acceptance the dozen studies of lucy he had enclosed with his application,roth
11139,11140,at the little impromptu party he gave that evening in roy s and joe roy and lucy mr,and mrs,roth
11141,11142,julian said they all owed a debt of gratitude to lucy nelson for being so photogenic,she deserved a prize too so he gave her a kiss,roth
11143,11144,he was still somebody whom she hadn t made up her mind she actually approved of and when she saw his lips coming her way she had a bad moment in which she almost pulled away,it wasn t just mr,roth
11145,11146,sowerby s behavior with his wife or his language that caused her to be slightly repulsed nor the fact that someone five foot five and smelling of cigars wasn t particularly her idea of attractive,it was that during the last month there had been several occasions when she thought she had caught him looking too long at her legs,roth
11147,11148,could roy be telling his uncle what they were doing,she just couldn t believe it he might know they parked up at passion paradise but so did ellie and joe whetstone and all they did was neck,roth
11149,11150,at least that s what ellie surely what her parents believed,no nobody knew anything at all and mr,roth
11151,11152,sowerby was probably only looking at the floor or at nothing those times she thought he was looking at her legs,after all she was just eighteen and he was eleanor s father and her legs had no shape or so she thought and it was ridiculous to imagine as she had when she had found herself alone with him in the house one saturday afternoon that he was going to follow her up to ellie s room and try to do something to her,roth
11153,11154,she was getting sex on the brain too,she and roy really had to stop what they had begun she just knew it,roth
11155,11156,he liked it so much he was dragging her up there every night and maybe she liked it too but liking it wasn t the issue what was then,that s what roy asked whenever she started saying no no not tonight but why not tonight if last night,roth
11157,11158,anyway when mr,sowerby kissed her it was loud and on the cheek and everyone was laughing and mrs,roth
11159,11160,sowerby was right there watching trying to laugh too,it was as unlike lucy as anything could a way it was one of the strangest things she had ever in the confusion that came of being told in public that she was attractive in the excitement that came of being so much a part of this celebration of this family of this house she shrugged her shoulders turned bright red and kissed uncle julian back,roth
11161,11162,roy applauded,bravo he cried and mrs,roth
11163,11164,sowerby stopped trying to laugh,well too bad for her,roth
11165,11166,there really was very little lucy could do that met with mrs,sowerby s approval,roth
11167,11168,she was a dowdy snobbish woman who even seemed to hold against lucy the fact that it was she who had finally had the strongest influence in deciding what roy should become,which was certainly none of mrs,roth
11169,11170,sowerby s though that did appear to be the case why roy had decided to go to photography school in fort kean where britannia was located seemed to have less to do with the quality of the training he would receive with whatever natural talent he had for taking pictures to be with the fact that lucy happened to be going down to school in fort kean too,that roy had been guided in his decision by such a consideration was hardly a fact that displeased lucy,roth
11171,11172,on the other hand it was one more refutation of that idea she had formed of him before they had met that he was a serious young man who had choices before him of real magnitude and gravity,no he wasn t exactly turning out to be entirely as she had imagined him back that that was all to his discredit however,roth
11173,11174,for one thing he really wasn t as rude and illmannered as he had first appeared,and he wasn t indifferent to others feelings least of all to hers,roth
11175,11176,once the showing off had stopped once he was no longer as frightened of her she realized as she had been of him he was altogether sweet and considerate,in his amiability he even reminded her a little of mr,roth
11177,11178,valerio which was certainly a compliment,nor was he superior in his attitudes which was something she had just assumed would be the case given his age and experience,roth
11179,11180,he never tried to boss her for sex and even there she knew that when she decided enough was enough probably that very night there was nothing he would be able to do to force her to resume,there was nothing he could have done to force her to start either only why hadn t she realized that at the time,roth
11181,11182,the worst that could have happened was that he would never have seen her again,and would that have been a tragedy,roth
11183,11184,truthfully there were a lot of important ways in which she was discovering that she didn t like roy that much,at times it even seemed as though it were she who was two and a half years older than roy not the other way around,roth
11185,11186,she simply couldn t bear him when he sang those songs into her ear first of all,he was so childish sometimes even if he was now twentyone and old enough to vote as he kept saying to everyone,roth
11187,11188,sometimes the things he said were nothing less than stupid,in the car for instance he kept telling her that he loved her but was that stupid,roth
11189,11190,what if it was true,or what if he was only saying it for fear that if he didn t she wouldn t let him go all the way any more,roth
11191,11192,oh she knew she knew she should never have started up in the car,it wasn t right if you weren t married and it was even worse with someone you never could marry either,roth
11193,11194,we must stop,but somehow it made no more sense to stop now that they had begun than it had made to start in the first place,roth
11195,11196,what she should really stop was the whole stupid thing,midway through july she and roy drove down to fort kean one wednesday to look for a place for him to live in september,roth
11197,11198,after inspecting each rooming house he came back to where lucy sat in the parked car and said he didn t think the place was right at least for him either the room smelled funny or the landlady looked suspicious or the bed was too short something he had had enough of for sixteen months in the aleutians,in the one place that was huge room with a bed in it that used to be the landlady s husband s who d been six foot five where the toilet was spotless and the roomer guaranteed a shelf of his own in the was no private entrance,roth
11199,11200,well said lucy there had to be,at four that afternoon they had the worst argument they had ever had with each other and far and away the worst roy had ever had with anyone his father included,roth
11201,11202,to what was still the best allaround deal all she could do was vehemently shake her head and say no there had to be a private entrance if he expected ever to see her again,suddenly crying out well i don t s me who has to live here he wheeled the hudson around and drove back to the house with the long bed,roth
11203,11204,when he got back to the car he took a road map from the glove compartment and on its face carefully drew a rectangle,this is my room he said managing not to look at her,roth
11205,11206,it was on the first floor a corner room with two tall windows on either side all four let out onto a wide porch surrounded by shrubs,they were as good as four private entrances,roth
11207,11208,at night a person could just step in and out of the windows exactly as though they were doors well what did she want to say,was she really planning on never speaking to him again or did she have an opinion to express,roth
11209,11210,i expressed my opinion she said,it s only a room,roth
11211,11212,he pulled the car to the curb so lucy could take another look at her new home,the college was across pendleton park from the main business section of fort kean,roth
11213,11214,it had been built as a boys preparatory school in the s in the thirties the school went under and the property had been unused until the war when it was occupied by the army signal corps,after vj day the site had been purchased by the state barracks and all for its expanding educational program,roth
11215,11216,it was certainly not the ivycovered college campus one saw in the movies or read about in books the barracks that the army had thrown up long faded yellow buildings were used as classrooms and the administration building and dormitory was an old square fortresslike structure of gray stone that stood almost directly onto the street and resembled the county courthouse in winnisaw,she did not answer,roth
11217,11218,oh angel i do care what you think,you know that,roth
11219,11220,what you think is important to me,but i have to live somewhere don t i,roth
11221,11222,well lucy just be t i,sometimes you re just too sarcastic when i m only asking for a simple answer,roth
11223,11224,i ve got to get my eight hours sleep if i expect to get the most out of classes,well don t i,roth
11225,11226,so i need the long bed,no she said for he had taken her hand and really seemed to be in pain,roth
11227,11228,so then how can you be angry,lucy come on what s the sense of fighting,roth
11229,11230,let s have a coke okay,then we ll start home,roth
11231,11232,come on say the fight is over,why ruin the day,roth
11233,11234,she saw that there was no point in arguing with him any further,for in that instant she made up her only she had made it up earlier in the day she could have saved them both the misery of a fight she would never set foot in that room of his so long as she lived no matter how many windows it had or even doors,roth
11235,11236,it was really as simple as that,that very night she would not drive up with him to passion paradise,roth
11237,11238,when instantly he grew sulky and morose and seemed about ready to break into tears again she told him it was because she was not well,it happened to be the truth but then at home with a thick black crayon she circled on her calendar the day she would make it altogether clear their romance was over at the same time xing out another day of her life in liberty center fiftyeight to go,roth
11239,11240,it looked as though the bad news could not be broken to roy until sunday the following night there were already plans to drive up to the selkirk fair with ellie and joe with whom they doubled at least once a week now that lucy was working only during the day and on friday evening roy expected her to go over to winnisaw with him to see a date with judy then on saturday there was the barbecue at the sowerbys,it was a barbecue for the sowerbys adult friends and when roy s uncle had invited the long drink of water to come and to bring blondie with him it had delighted lucy secretly no less than roy,roth
11241,11242,she was coming to like mr,sowerby more all the time and to admire certain of his qualities,roth
11243,11244,as roy said he really didn t give a hoot about people s opinions he did and said whatever he wanted whenever he wanted,that was awfully hard to turn down,roth
11245,11246,she supposed she could wait until sunday without losing three nights more away from home in fact,surely any diversion even if it involved roy was better than sitting up in her hot room listening to her family rocking downstairs on the porch or lying awake in the dark bedroom unable to sleep until she heard her father s footsteps coming up the stairs and she had determined solely for the record whether he was actually going off to bed sober,roth
11247,11248,what had always made summer particularly awful was that with all the doors and windows open her sense of the presence of those whom she could hardly abide was painfully horribly acute,just to hear someone she hated yawn could drive her to distraction if she happened to be in an angry mood,roth
11249,11250,now however she was out every night until twelvethirty by which time they were usually asleep not that it was any pleasure hearing someone you hated snore if it made you start thinking about them,on the hottest nights rather than being locked up with her family she and roy would sit on one of the benches down by the river catching what breeze there was and staring off into the black stillness of water under the winnisaw bridge,roth
11251,11252,she would think about college and fort often roy would begin to sing to her in a voice that really wasn t that bad or so she was willing to admit in the pleasure of contemplating the future that would soon be hers,he sang like vaughan monroe and like dick haymes he could do nat king cole singing nature boy and mel blanc doing woody woodpecker and ray bolger whom he thought he resembled in build doing once in love with amy after they saw the jolson story he did for her his imitation of the incomparable al jolson,roth
11253,11254,that was how roy introduced himself as hand in hand they sat down by the river on those close nights during what was to be the last summer of lucy s arduous and unhappy youth,ladies and gentlemen if you will the incomparable the one and only al jolson,roth
11255,11256,fiftyseven,fiftysix,roth
11257,11258,at the sowerby barbecue on saturday night she got into a long serious discussion with roy s first real which she heard herself assuring mr,bassart that he really shouldn t have anxiety or doubt any longer about roy s future,roth
11259,11260,mr,bassart said that he still could not figure where the interest in photography had suddenly come from,roth
11261,11262,his experience with young people had long ago convinced him not to bank too heavily on sudden enthusiasms since they had a habit of disappearing under strain,he was he admitted relieved that the months wasted wading around in what he called a swamp of halfbaked ideas had come to an end but now what concerned him was whether roy had really chosen something he was going to be able to stick with when the going got rough,roth
11263,11264,what did lucy think,oh said lucy his heart was really in photography she was sure of it,roth
11265,11266,what makes you so sure asked mr,bassart in his flat voice,roth
11267,11268,she thought quickly and said that photography wasn t such an astonishing interest for roy to have when you thought that really it was a wonderful way of combining his present interest in drawing with his old interest in printing,mr,roth
11269,11270,bassart reflected upon what she had said,so did she reddening,roth
11271,11272,i think that s true in a manner of speaking mr,what about your own plans,roth
11273,11274,bassart finally said during a paragraph break those are all good goals she believed she had won approval enough for the time being and shut up,later had asked not a single question about her background he did not appear to be any more interested in the subject than julian sowerby men like that judged you not on family history but on the kind of person you were,roth
11275,11276,only mrs,bassart who seemed to have fallen instantly under her sister s influence and irene sowerby seemed to hold against her things she wasn t even responsible for,roth
11277,11278,the others to their credit weren t interested in gossip and ancient included,since the beginning of summer roy had taken to picking her up at the house after dinner each night,roth
11279,11280,she was always ready when he arrived giving him little encouragement she hoped to linger and make conversation,on the one occasion when he seemed to be trying to draw her into revealing something she answered so sharply that he had never brought up the subject again,roth
11281,11282,it was after his first meeting with her family all of whom were gathered in the living room after dinner,the young man arrived was quickly introduced and led by lucy straight back out the door,roth
11283,11284,it hadn t even taken place,of course your mother s older than jennifer jones roy said,roth
11285,11286,and your grandfather is mr,carroll from the post office,roth
11287,11288,now i didn t even know that,why on earth had she given in when he said it was time he was introduced to her folks,roth
11289,11290,they were crossing the winnisaw bridge,from then on neither bassart nor sowerby asked any question about her home life,roth
11291,11292,ellie couldn t have cared less and so it was only in the company of irene sowerby or roy s mother that lucy became unduly conscious of what ordinarily she was able after all these years of practice to drive clear out of her mind,of late she hardly ever had cause outside the house to think of herself as the kid who had done this or the kid whose father had done that,roth
11293,11294,to the many people she met socially at the sowerbys for the first time on that saturday them the principal mr,brunn and his was very simply roy bassart s girl,roth
11295,11296,so said mr,brunn who s keeping who in line said roy,roth
11297,11298,and are you off to school in september dear asked mrs,brunn,roth
11299,11300,dear,just like mrs,roth
11301,11302,sowerby,yes said lucy,roth
11303,11304,brunn,very nice,roth
11305,11306,good luck to you lucy,keep up our reputation,roth
11307,11308,brunn,it wasn t till sunday that she was to tell him that she d had enough and it was still only saturday night,roth
11309,11310,and when she told him what would happen,i m not going to be able to see you again,roth
11311,11312,ever what but it s not loveit s just sex it s what sex not to me look is that what it is to you,because to me oh no he d weep this is terrible and just knew wouldn t go to fort kean at all,roth
11313,11314,if she broke off with him now he would give up britannia give up all his plans probably in the end give up photography too despite what she had said to his father in his defense,and then he would be right back in his swamp of ideas but that was his affair not hers or was it,roth
11315,11316,he was so good to her so kind to her sweeter to her than anybody had ever been before in her life and day in and day out too,how could she turn around now and be so heartless and cruel,roth
11317,11318,especially when it was only a matter of a few more weeks,it might even mean his whole career,roth
11319,11320,because he depended on listened to loved her,roy loves me,roth
11321,11322,at least that s what he said,i love you angel he said at the door,roth
11323,11324,he kissed her nose,brunn for one,roth
11325,11326,everybody he kissed her yet again,me he said,roth
11327,11328,ten months ago she was still in the band marching behind leola krapp and now she was going steady,going all the way practically every night,roth
11329,11330,she circled six days in july and ten in august and then on september first she took her crayon and circled four times around the day after labor day,she had started out to circle labor day itself until she remembered that she and roy and ellie and joe whetstone were to go off canoeing on the river an event that had been planned by roy weeks before,roth
11331,11332,if only everything weren t planned so far in advance,if only he didn t need her so depend on her so love her so,roth
11333,11334,but did he,when they arrived on labor day morning at the sowerbys roy s aunt irene came outside to say that ellie had been sick in the night and was still sleeping,roth
11335,11336,she suggested that the three young people had better go off by themselves for the day,but even as she spoke a very sad and wanlooking ellie appeared in the upstairs hall window wearing her bathrobe,roth
11337,11338,she waved,but i want to go ellie called down in a weak voice,roth
11339,11340,it wouldn t be safe el said joe,sowerby,roth
11341,11342,but i planned to go said ellie and suddenly she drew down the shade as though she was about to weep,it was decided that the three young people should come inside while ellie washed and dressed and had a little breakfast of tea and toast then if she really did seem to have recovered perhaps the youngsters could go ahead with their plans,roth
11343,11344,ellie s troubles had begun the previous evening while mrs,sowerby had been away at an informal meeting of the officers of the quilt society,roth
11345,11346,in mrs,sowerby s absence ellie and her father had sat around the tv set eating three pounds of cherries followed by a quart of vanilla fudge ice cream topped off with half a chocolate nut cake left over from dinner,roth
11347,11348,julian sowerby feeling fine claimed ellie s upset stomach had nothing to do with a little dish of ice cream and a piece of cake ellie simply had the heebiejeebies about going away to school in two weeks,roy said that maybe ellie had inherited her father s good looks everyone laughed julian loudest of all but that perhaps she hadn t been so fortunate as to inherit his castiron stomach,roth
11349,11350,that s probably true mr,sowerby was joe s comment,roth
11351,11352,joe assured mrs,sowerby that if she let ellie come along he would be sure to see that she didn t touch anything sweet,roth
11353,11354,mrs,bassart had prepared an immense picnic basket for them but roy said that he and joe would take care of ellie s portion without too much trouble,roth
11355,11356,in a few minutes ellie came down the stairs in white shorts white polo shirt and white sandals,her daily on the back lawn and down by the dazzling as did her hair which over the summer had taken on a coppery sheen,roth
11357,11358,but this morning her face looked small and worn and her hullo was hardly audible as she went off to the kitchen to try to put a little food into her long shapely body her body,her long and shapely body,roth
11359,11360,lucy s understanding of ellie s condition was instantaneous,my god it s happened,roth
11361,11362,to ellie sowerby,julian sowerby drove off with his clubs to the winnisaw golf club and the young people consented to forgo the canoeing and take mrs,roth
11363,11364,sowerby s advice and find a nice shady spot up at the picnic grounds to have their outing,but even hidden away under a tree the temperature rose steadily about one o clock ellie began to feel woozy and so they drove back to the sowerbys in roy s car,roth
11365,11366,the house was very quiet,the shades were drawn in the front bedroom where apparently mrs,roth
11367,11368,sowerby was taking a nap and the family car was still gone a fact that caused ellie some consternation,apparently she had expected to find her father already home,roth
11369,11370,do you want me to wake your mother el asked joe,no no,roth
11371,11372,ellie asked lucy to come up with her to her room,once there she locked the door threw herself onto her bed and beneath the white organdy canopy began to cry,roth
11373,11374,lucy watched her friend weeping her heart out,on the lawn below she saw the person responsible pick up a croquet mallet and begin to knock a ball around through the wickets,roth
11375,11376,in two days joe was to report for freshman football practice at the university of alabama,partly it was ellie s recollection of life in the south during the early years of the war that seemed to have influenced joe to accept the alabama scholarship,roth
11377,11378,joe was to leave for school the very next would he still go,or would ellie now go with him,roth
11379,11380,roy had organized the day s outing and had his mother prepare the lunch as his own farewell party to joe whetstone whom he had come to consider his closest buddy,lucy herself had always thought of joe as one big blah,roth
11381,11382,sure he was a great athlete she supposed and you had to admit he was handsome and ruggedlooking if you liked that type but he had not a single opinion of his own on any subject,whatever you said joe agreed with,roth
11383,11384,there were times when she felt like reciting the declaration of independence just to watch his head go up and down and to hear him say after every famous sentence you bet that sure is true that sure does make a lot of sense boy that s just what my mom says the temptation to reveal him for the imbecile that he was came over her most strongly when roy was purposely acting for joe s benefit telling some funny story about what had happened to him up in the aleutians or discussing some college football team he and joe called the crimson tide and which normally he didn t seem to be interested in at all,but she had never given in to the temptation she hadn t even told ellie her real opinion of joe whetstone,roth
11385,11386,and now it was too late,now joe had gotten ellie into trouble the worst kind of trouble there could possibly be for a girl,roth
11387,11388,and joe didn t even appear to know it,roy called to joe,roth
11389,11390,appling s up,two on,roth
11391,11392,hey joe the arm he said,oh boy roy said sourly swing and a miss,roth
11393,11394,hey said joe stan the man and he changed his batting stance and swung at an imaginary ball,what about college now,roth
11395,11396,what about the sowerbys,what about ellie s future if she had to marry joe whetstone,roth
11397,11398,and what if he already knew and didn t care,maybe he wanted to marry ellie but she was crying because she didn t want to marry him,roth
11399,11400,i have to tell somebody ellie said turning to lucy and clutching the pillow to her chest,what said lucy softly,roth
11401,11402,she had done a stupid thing,a terrible stupid thing,roth
11403,11404,her whole life would never be the same,why,roth
11405,11406,and it s not the first time either said ellie sobbing,then she s not pregnant,roth
11407,11408,and another,you locked it said lucy impatiently,roth
11409,11410,then sit over here,on the bed,roth
11411,11412,i don t want to shout,oh i don t know what to do,roth
11413,11414,this is so awful i ve been trying to tell you for so long,i needed somebody s advice that i could talk it over with but i just couldn t,roth
11415,11416,and i shouldn t,oh but i just have lucy you have to promise me,roth
11417,11418,you can t repeat it to anyone,not even roy,roth
11419,11420,lucy don t tell you promise,you have to promise me lucy,roth
11421,11422,and that s not all said ellie,actual money she said and the tears rolled off her cheeks onto her white polo shirt,roth
11423,11424,just then they heard the door to mrs,sowerby s room open down the hall,roth
11425,11426,dear are you in there she asked,yes,roth
11427,11428,lucy too,but i m fine,roth
11429,11430,i promise,it was practically a hundred though,roth
11431,11432,and buggy,and crowded,roth
11433,11434,sowerby descending the stairs,neither of them spoke until the screen door opened down below and joe was saying sox are out in front mrs,roth
11435,11436,hey aunt irene tell joe which team luke appling plays for,no no tell him what a bunt is,roth
11437,11438,sowerby about sports and mrs,sowerby could be heard obligingly making them laugh while upstairs eleanor began to tell lucy the whole story,roth
11439,11440,it had begun about a year ago on a summer night when she and her father had been home alone,it was after eleven and she was in bed when suddenly she remembered she had forgotten to tell judy rollins not to say anything to anyone about something ellie had told her and so she reached over and picked up her bedside telephone,roth
11441,11442,of course the instant she heard her father talking on the downstairs line she knew she should hang up,only the voice on the other end she recognized as belonging to nobody but mrs,roth
11443,11444,mayerhofer the manager of daddy s laundromat in selkirk about whom he was always complaining to her mother,mrs,roth
11445,11446,mayerhofer was as he put it a little slow on the pickup there actually wasn t a single thing that he didn t have to explain to her ten times before she got it right,he kept her on almost solely out of by her husband she had an infant child to because unlike her predecessor the illustrious mrs,roth
11447,11448,jarvis it didn t appear that mrs,mayerhofer was going to steal him deaf dumb and blind,roth
11449,11450,on the phone her father was saying that he just couldn t get up to selkirk until the end of the week because he was so tied up right here in liberty center and mrs,mayerhofer said that she didn t think she could wait until the end of the week and ellie still remembered thinking boy what a moron until she heard her father laugh and say that in the meantime then she was just going to have to make do with the old hotwater bottle,roth
11451,11452,mrs,mayerhofer laughed and ellie said it was as though her bones and her blood and everything inside her had turned to stone,roth
11453,11454,she pushed the receiver down into her pillow and held it there for what seemed like ages when at last she raised it to her ear again the line was so she called rollins,what else could she do,roth
11455,11456,this was just before she and lucy had first gotten to know each other ellie said,actually she had been dying back then to tell lucy what she had overheard only she d felt so ashamed and very shortly so uncertain as to whether what she had heard meant what she had taken it to she decided to stop seeing lucy entirely for the time being rather than risk ruining their friendship and making a terrible fool of herself and her family,roth
11457,11458,for the moment ellie s words confused lucy and not simply because of the disordered way in which her friend offered her explanation,she had to work out in her head the significance of all that ellie had just is the significance to herself,roth
11459,11460,she would lie awake ellie was saying just lie awake after that for hours on end in dread of ever overhearing such a conversation again and then silently lift the phone off the receiver,it was a nightmare she didn t want to catch him and she couldn t stop trying to,roth
11461,11462,then that winter her father came home one evening and said that mrs,mayerhofer my mental giant was his expression had flown the coop just disappeared from her apartment in baggage and all,roth
11463,11464,the very next day he drove up to interview and hire somebody else for the job,the woman selected was named edna spatz,roth
11465,11466,and that was all that had happened,she never heard him with mrs,roth
11467,11468,mayerhofer on the phone a second time nor was there any reason for her to suspect edna spatz,yet every time her father went off to the selkirk store ellie knew it was to carry on behind her mother s though she knew too that edna spatz had a husband in selkirk and two small children,roth
11469,11470,this was about the time she and lucy had started seeing each other again and on more occasions than she could even count ellie had wanted to blurt out to her the whole horrible story about mrs,mayerhofer,roth
11471,11472,only mrs,mayerhofer was so terribly dumb and uneducated,roth
11473,11474,so he couldn t with her he simply couldn t,he simply wouldn t even want to,roth
11475,11476,or so she had gotten herself to believe until last night,she had been on the stairs when the phone rang and so she raced up to her room thinking that it was joe who had said he would call around nine,roth
11477,11478,in the meantime her father had picked up the downstairs phone it s okay princess he had called up to her it s just for me she had called back okay daddy and gone ahead into her room closed the door and without any knowledge that she was even going to do it gently lifted the phone off the hook,at first she couldn t even hear the words being spoken,roth
11479,11480,it was as though she had a heart beating in her head and another in her throat and the rest of her simply didn t exist,on the other end a woman was speaking,roth
11481,11482,whether it was edna spatz she didn t know,she had come to imagine mrs,roth
11483,11484,spatz as no less a dimwit than mrs,mayerhofer and the trouble with the voice on the other end was that it sounded smart and young,roth
11485,11486,the woman was saying that if she couldn t cover her check she didn t know what would happen to her,her father said this was something he would have to take care of not by telephone,roth
11487,11488,he was whispering into the phone but he was angry,the woman began to cry,roth
11489,11490,she said that the agency had threatened to take her to court,she called him julian julian and she wept,roth
11491,11492,she said she was sorry she knew she shouldn t call she had dialed and hung up half a dozen times over the weekend but who else did she have to turn to but julian julian,it was at that point that ellie felt she could not bear to hear another word,roth
11493,11494,the woman sounded so so young,so she buried the phone in the pillow again and just sat there not knowing what to do,roth
11495,11496,only a minute or so later her father called up the stairs to her,she replaced the phone as quietly as she could and came quickly down to him chattering gaily all the while,roth
11497,11498,she knew he was watching her every expression to see whether she had been listening but ellie was sure that she had not given herself away in anything she had said or done,she kept talking about joe this and joe that and instantly sat next to him on the couch when invited keep me company daisy mae even let him hold her hand while the two of them watched tv together and ate all those cherries,roth
11499,11500,that s why she had consumed so much junk she was afraid to stop for fear he would think something was bothering her,and all the time they were sitting on the couch she had the most absurd thought that she had an older sister whom she knew nothing about and that it was she who had been on the phone asking her father to send money,roth
11501,11502,of course she was only making up the idea of a sister and knew so then she began to think that maybe she was making up the whole incident,lucy i m so miserable,roth
11503,11504,because i just don t know,yes,roth
11505,11506,but who is it,who could it possibly be,roth
11507,11508,and my poor mother she said weeping profusely once again she doesn t even know,nobody knows,roth
11509,11510,mr,sowerby offered each of the boys a bottle of beer against mrs,roth
11511,11512,sowerby s better judgment,come on they ll all be in college in a week,roth
11513,11514,roy here is responsible for us winning the war against the north pole,then he opened the top button of his shirt and looked inside,roth
11515,11516,nothing he said,they sat out on the lawn till long after dark,roth
11517,11518,ellie was stretched out in a beach chair with an afghan thrown over her and just her head sticking out,it looked very very small,roth
11519,11520,roy sat on the grass holding his beer bottle in one hand his head swung back against lucy s legs whenever he took a swig from the bottle,joe whetstone was stretched out on his stomach his chin resting on his two fists,roth
11521,11522,he was looking up at the sky and every once in a while he said boy oh boy,better she answered after a moment,roth
11523,11524,sure sure,roy and joe laughed,roth
11525,11526,roy don t tease her said mrs,sowerby,roth
11527,11528,sorry ellieo said roy,julian lit a cigar,roth
11529,11530,no thank you just the same mr,sowerby,roth
11531,11532,how about you general he asked roy,sure said roy if it s a good one,roth
11533,11534,not too bad he said holding it off at arm s length and muffling a cough,a real pro said uncle julian,roth
11535,11536,ordinarily lucy couldn t stand to watch roy smoke a cigar or drink a beer he really cared very little for either,but this evening there were matters more grave to brood upon than roy s showing off for his uncle,roth
11537,11538,there was the uncle himself whose secret had finally been revealed there was ellie who knew the secret there was mrs,sowerby who did not and there was herself,roth
11539,11540,all these months she had been believing that ellie was indifferent to her past and suddenly it was clear that nothing but that past had caused ellie to befriend her in september and to resume that friendship again in february,it was a startling discovery,roth
11541,11542,all this time so stupidly so innocently so dreamily she had been thinking that to ellie sowerby she was not the kid whose father hung out at earl s dugout not the kid who had gained notoriety by calling the police to come take him away when that was precisely who she was,all she was,roth
11543,11544,it had caused her much pain that afternoon to understand that all of her attraction for ellie lay in that past which she herself wanted never to think about again so long as she lived,and it had made her angry too,roth
11545,11546,her temptation earlier in the afternoon had been to rise in indignation and tell ellie exactly what she thought of her,you mean that s what i am to you ellie,roth
11547,11548,that s why you wanted me to be a friend,to my face you actually have the nerve to admit that when you dropped me it was because you believed you didn t need me any more,roth
11549,11550,at first she restrained her anger so as to hear the story of julian sowerby s deception to its conclusion but even before ellie had finished she began to understand eleanor s attraction to her as something else entirely,ellie actually admired her,roth
11551,11552,her courage,her pride,roth
11553,11554,her strength,wasn t that a deeper way a truer way to see it,roth
11555,11556,ellie sowerby with all her clothes and boys and beauty and money had turned for help and her,well what should ellie do then,roth
11557,11558,what,her mind began to examine the possibilities,roth
11559,11560,hey what happened to blondie tonight julian was asking,sowerby,roth
11561,11562,sowerby said joe,yes it s going to do all of you a world of good said mrs,roth
11563,11564,sowerby,poor woman,roth
11565,11566,how mortifying,how wrong,roth
11567,11568,how unjust it was the first time that her heart had opened fully to ellie s mother,she saw at last that she was something more than her own potential enemy,roth
11569,11570,to understand that mrs,sowerby suffered was somehow to understand that she existed had a life had motives and reasons having nothing to do with frustrating and opposing lucy nelson,roth
11571,11572,the fact was that she had never opposed her,the decision ellie had made to stop seeing lucy back in september had by her own admission nothing at all to do with any instructions she had received from her mother,roth
11573,11574,only now could lucy see that during these past months mrs,sowerby had never been anything but kind to her,roth
11575,11576,her ways might be somewhat oldfashioned and her manner a little remote but was that so bad,what harm had she ever done lucy,roth
11577,11578,my god it wasn t mrs,sowerby who had been smallminded it had been lucy herself,roth
11579,11580,she should be ashamed of herself for her suspicions,even when she had appeared wearing one of ellie s cashmere sweaters mrs,roth
11581,11582,sowerby s exasperation probably had to do entirely with eleanor s barely disguised condescension and nothing to do with disapproval of lucy for being covetous of her daughter s clothes,she was a patient gentle and sympathetic at her treatment not only of lucy but of roy,roth
11583,11584,she alone of his entire family seemed to take his problems and dilemmas seriously she alone accorded him genuine respect,who had the dignity the selfpossession of mrs,roth
11585,11586,sowerby,she could think of no one,roth
11587,11588,and was this the reward to be paid that dignity,was this how julian sowerby chose to express his respect and gratitude to a woman of such refinement and generosity,roth
11589,11590,because she happened to have to wear special elasticized stockings because in her middle age she was tending toward heaviness because her hair had begun to turn to gray was that sufficient cause for such a person to be deceived disgraced discarded by a philandering loudmouthed little pig of a man,blondie,roth
11591,11592,cutiepie,what a person,roth
11593,11594,what a disgusting cheat of a person,yet in her heart she had always known,roth
11595,11596,that was the amazing part,what should ellie do,roth
11597,11598,tell her mother,tell her uncle lloyd,roth
11599,11600,or should she speak directly to her father so as to spare her mother from ever knowing,yes go to him and if he promises to end his associations with his women promises never to resume with them again or perhaps first she ought to find out who the woman was,roth
11601,11602,and then go to her,yes and tell her that she must break off relations with her father instantly or risk incarceration if it turned out as it might that she was a prostitute who sold her services to men like julian sowerby,roth
11603,11604,or perhaps ellie should keep her secret bide her time wait for the phone to ring then lift the extension and instead of burying the truth in her pillow instead of simply sitting like a ninny enduring his treachery put an end to it once and for all this is eleanor sowerby,i am julian sowerby s daughter,roth
11605,11606,wow said joe softly,in his excitement he sat straight up,roth
11607,11608,it s fall,he stood and stretched so that his cigar went waving over his head like some signal,roth
11609,11610,good idea said joe,he and roy told mrs,roth
11611,11612,sowerby that since it was the maid s night off the two of them would carry in all the dirty dishes,they made a big fuss about not letting her touch anything and shooed her directly into the house,roth
11613,11614,mr,sowerby began to fold up the chairs and roy began to whistle autumn leaves as he went around collecting the silverware,roth
11615,11616,what said lucy,ellie shivered pulled the afghan up over her hair and started to run for the open door,roth
11617,11618,hot stuff,watch it ladies anything further she said would have been overheard,roth
11619,11620,and then julian sowerby suddenly had each of them by the arm and laughing ran them into the house,the next day joe left for alabama and then ellie herself became desperately busy with shopping and packing and was almost perpetually in the company of her still seemed to be innocent of what was happening behind her back,roth
11621,11622,ellie and her family drove off to evanston on the second weekend in september and on the monday following on a day that lucy had encircled with five black rings on her calendar she and roy drove down with a carful of luggage to begin their schooling in fort kean,at the student health center a barracks building that had been converted into the infirmary she told the doctor that she believed she might be suffering from anemia,roth
11623,11624,her skin had always been on the pale side and in winter the tips of her toes and fingers went white and icy when it got very cold,after the examination she dressed and sat in a chair the doctor had pulled back for her in his office,roth
11625,11626,he said that he did not believe the problem was with the circulation in her extremities,looking out the window he asked if she had been having any trouble lately with her periods,roth
11627,11628,she said no then she said yes and then clutching her coat and her books in her arms she rushed out the door,in the narrow corridor she felt herself spinning but this time the sensation lasted only a second,roth
11629,11630,as soon as she pulled shut the door of the phone booth in the coffee shop she realized that roy would be in class,his landlady mrs,roth
11631,11632,blodgett answered and lucy hung up without even speaking,she thought of dialing the school and having him called to a phone but what would she say to him,roth
11633,11634,the strange sensation she began to the first wave of confusion gave way to a second even more that it did not have anything to do with him anyway,she found herself thinking like a child who does not know the facts of life who thinks that pregnancy is something that a woman does to herself or that simply happens to her if she wishes hard enough,roth
11635,11636,in her room she looked at all the ridiculous markings on her calendar,just the previous saturday after roy had driven her back to the dormitory from the movies she had drawn a thick black ring around thanksgiving day,roth
11637,11638,suddenly she felt dreadful she went and stood with her mouth open over the toilet but all she could cough up were some brownish strands of liquid,the dread remained,roth
11639,11640,that evening she did not answer when the onduty girl rapped on the door to her room and said that a roy was on the phone,at eight in the morning the other girls drifting down to the dining hall or running off to class lucy rushed back to the infirmary,roth
11641,11642,she had to wait on a bench in the corridor until ten when the doctor finally arrived,i was here yesterday she said,roth
11643,11644,when he returned to his desk she told him that she did not want a baby,he pushed his chair back a little and crossed one leg over the other,roth
11645,11646,that was all he did,doctor i m a freshman,roth
11647,11648,i ve been working for years to go to college,at night,roth
11649,11650,in a soda fountain,up in liberty center,roth
11651,11652,that s where i m from and summers whole summers,and i have a living aid scholarship,roth
11653,11654,if i hadn t gotten in here i might not even have been able to go to school at of money but she did not want to plead poverty or even helplessness,what he had to know was that she was not weak she was strong she had undergone many hardships and much wasn t just another eighteenyearold girl,roth
11655,11656,it wasn t merely that she needed his help she deserved it,this is my first real experience away from home doctor,roth
11657,11658,i ve been waiting for it all my life,saving for it,roth
11659,11660,doctor i m not promiscuous i swear it,i m just eighteen,roth
11661,11662,now he adjusted the spectacles down onto the bridge of his nose,i don t know what to do she said trying to regain her selfcontrol,roth
11663,11664,his face remained immobile,he had soft gray hair and kind eyes but he only scratched the side of his nose,roth
11665,11666,i don t know what to do she said again,he rocked a little in his chair,roth
11667,11668,doctor i never had a boy friend before,he was my first one,roth
11669,11670,he had pushed his glasses up again and now he began rubbing at his eyes,maybe he had been out on an emergency all night and was tired,roth
11671,11672,maybe he was thinking of what to say,maybe he wasn t even listening,roth
11673,11674,he came out to the school four mornings a week for two hours so what did he care,he had a practice of his own to worry about this was just so much extra cash,roth
11675,11676,maybe he was only letting time pass before he sent her away to deal with her own mess,he turned back to her,roth
11677,11678,and where is the young man he asked,or was it protective,roth
11679,11680,he was rubbing at his temples with the tips of his fingers,he was thinking,roth
11681,11682,he was going to help,don t you girls know what they re up to he asked in a soft and unhappy voice,roth
11683,11684,can t you imagine what they ll be like when something like this happens,a bright and pretty little girl like you lucy,roth
11685,11686,it might have been the first time she had ever heard it spoken,i m lucy,roth
11687,11688,i m bright,i m pretty,roth
11689,11690,oh her life was just beginning,so very much had happened to her in the last year the last month,roth
11691,11692,already there was a girl on her floor who knew a boy she wanted to fix lucy up with,only there had never once been an opportunity to meet him what with roy coming around every single night if only to stop off and say hello,roth
11693,11694,she was away from home at long long starting to be pretty,why why had she gotten involved with him to begin with,roth
11695,11696,because he called her angel,because he took those pictures,roth
11697,11698,because he sang all those stupid songs into her ear,that big goon hadn t the faintest idea what she was all about,roth
11699,11700,all summer long he d acted as though she were some kind of girl she wasn though she were some sort of monkey littlefield,and she had let him,roth
11701,11702,she had let him have his stupid way,and now this,roth
11703,11704,only this was what happened to farm girls to girls who didn t study who quit school who ran away from home,to babs egan but not to her,roth
11705,11706,hadn t enough happened to her already,doctor i don t know what i was thinking about she began to cry despite herself,roth
11707,11708,all i mean is lately i don t even know what i m doing sometimes she covered her face with her fingers,what does he plan to do about all this,roth
11709,11710,it was the truth but it was the wrong thing to have said,but you don t want to the doctor was speaking to her,roth
11711,11712,she looked up from her lap partly,just as it is,roth
11713,11714,but i m not even here three whole months,he had such a big wrinkled friendly just knew he had a family he loved and a nice house and a calm and pleasant life,roth
11715,11716,his feelings are something that have to be taken into consideration,he didn t love her,roth
11717,11718,he just sang those stupid songs into her ear,he says things but he doesn t even know what,roth
11719,11720,you re right i don t want to marry him,i don t want to lie to you,roth
11721,11722,i hate liars and i don t lie and that s the truth,please hundreds and hundreds of girls do what i did,roth
11723,11724,i didn t say that you were bad,i m sure you re not,roth
11725,11726,it s a habit,you do understand,roth
11727,11728,because that s what happened to me just what you said,there is a young man the doctor said,roth
11729,11730,there is a young man and there is your family,i ignore them,roth
11731,11732,i have nothing to do with them,they re inferior doctor she added when he still didn t seem to believe her,roth
11733,11734,yes but she should have left him years and years ago if she had any sense,any selfrespect,roth
11735,11736,she should have found a man who would be good to her and respect her like you she thought,if you had met my mother if she had married you she heard herself saying some people think someone said once she looks like jennifer jones,roth
11737,11738,she mustn t ask to be pitied she mustn t whimper she mustn t fall to pieces,that s what her mother would do,roth
11739,11740,lucy i think you should go home,today,roth
11741,11742,maybe she understands more than you imagine,maybe she won t be angry,roth
11743,11744,he was trying to get out of it,that s exactly what he was beginning to do,roth
11745,11746,you seem to love her,love has nothing to do with it,roth
11747,11748,love is what s wrong with her,she s so weak,roth
11749,11750,only you can help she said standing,could he understand the situation as he did and then turn around and say he wasn t going to help,roth
11751,11752,but this isn t fair she cried,the doctor nodded his head,roth
11753,11754,sit there pushing your glasses up and down,sit there being wise to me,roth
11755,11756,call me my dear instantly she sat back down in her chair,oh i m sorry,roth
11757,11758,i didn t mean that,but why are you,roth
11759,11760,i mean you see what happened,you understand she felt now that she had to plead with him to convince him that he was right,roth
11761,11762,you do understand doctor,on all of us,roth
11763,11764,he stood,but what s going to happen to me,roth
11765,11766,don t you care she asked,then he spoke,roth
11767,11768,please do not lecture me in that superior tone,i refuse to be lectured to by a perfect stranger who doesn t know the first thing about all i have had to put up with in my life,roth
11769,11770,you re interesting he said in your expectations,you re perfectly are not just another eighteenyearold girl he opened the door,roth
11771,11772,but what about my life,well i won t she said in a low fierce tone,roth
11773,11774,good luck he said softly as she brushed by him and then shut the door behind her,you coward she moaned as she went rushing off to the coffee shop you weakling she wept as she carried the phone book into the booth at the back of the store you selfish heartless as she drew her finger down the list of physicians in the yellow pages of the directory imagining them one after another saying to her you can not expect me young lady to save your life and seeing herself dragging from one office to another humiliated ignored and abused,roth
11775,11776,on thanksgiving day they all sat down to the turkey and she told her family that she and roy bassart had decided to get married,what her father said,roth
11777,11778,she repeated herself,why he demanded to know and slammed down the carving instruments,roth
11779,11780,she alone ate right through to the mince pie while overhead various members of the family in various ways tried to get lucy to unlock her door,berta however said she was sick and tired of disorder and tragedy and refused to allow every single pleasant moment to be destroyed by one person or another year in and year out,roth
11781,11782,roy phoned at four in the afternoon,she came out of her bedroom to take the call but would not speak until the kitchen was cleared of adults,roth
11783,11784,roy said that he couldn t get away to see her before nine,but what had they said when he told them,roth
11785,11786,nothing,he hadn t told them yet,roth
11787,11788,at ninethirty he telephoned from the sowerbys saying that he had decided to wait until he was back in his own house alone with his parents before he broke the news,well when will that be roy i don t know exactly,roth
11789,11790,well how can i know exactly,later but he was the one who had wanted to call them a week ago from fort kean he was the one she said who had thought there was nothing that wrong with having to get married so long as you were a couple who was going to marry anyway probably sooner or later,roth
11791,11792,hi lucy,you can imagine,roth
11793,11794,i m going crazy in this science course,hey we re all rolling on the floor listening to roy s adventures in that britannia school,roth
11795,11796,what a place,and i m actually drinking,roth
11797,11798,have i got things to tell you,i ve met somebody marvelous ellie whispered,roth
11799,11800,i almost sent you his picture,i ll do it when i suddenly he hung up,roth
11801,11802,she dialed again,mr,roth
11803,11804,bassart picked up the phone,just who is this he asked,roth
11805,11806,she didn t breathe,look no pranks at this hour whoever you are,roth
11807,11808,i was going to call you roy said,we haven t had breakfast even,roth
11809,11810,can t you just let things settle for a few hours,roy what are you talking about,roth
11811,11812,i m calling from a booth lucy,i m on my way to mr,roth
11813,11814,brunn s to pick up something for my father,you can t do this,roth
11815,11816,i m sorry,hello,roth
11817,11818,she called eleanor s house,ellie it s lucy,roth
11819,11820,i have to know what s going on ellie,he says he s thinking about it but lucy they think you re making somebody s pulling into the driveway,roth
11821,11822,we all are,i mean it s a surprise,roth
11823,11824,the doors to the bastille were chained shut and she had to walk all around the cold campus before she found the watchman,he led her over to the buildings and grounds office in barracks number three sat her down in a chair and took out his spectacles to look for her name in the student directory,roth
11825,11826,and all those names printed in the register made her think run away,who would ever find her,roth
11827,11828,in her room she beat her fists on the pillow on the headboard on the wall,it was awful,roth
11829,11830,it was horrible,every other college girl in america was home right now having a good time with her friends and her family,roth
11831,11832,yet her mother had begged her grandfather had begged even her father had asked her to stay,they said that it was just that they were stunned by the news,roth
11833,11834,wouldn t she agree they reasoned through the door that it was a little unexpected,they would try to get used to it if only she wouldn t run off like this on a holiday weekend,roth
11835,11836,they were shocked at first and had maybe lost their heads,it was after all only the first semester of that college life she had been dreaming about for so long,roth
11837,11838,but probably she knew what she was doing if her mind was made up the way it sounded that it was,so wouldn t she stay through monday,roth
11839,11840,when she was fifteen years old and on her own decided on catholic as her religious preference had they stood in her way,no she had insisted that it was what she wanted and they had decided to let her go ahead,roth
11841,11842,and later when she had changed her mind and turned back to presbyterian again well that too had been her own decision made on her own without interference from any person in the family,and the same with the snare drum,roth
11843,11844,another decision made on her own that they had honored and respected until finally she decided to give that up too,of course they weren t meaning to draw any comparison between taking up the snare drum and taking a husband for life but their attitude had been that if she preferred beating the drums to resuming piano which they reminded her she had dropped at ten her own decision once again or beginning something like accordion which had been daddy will s compromise suggestion they had no choice but to let her have her way,roth
11845,11846,their house was not a dictatorship it was a democracy in which every person had his was respected for them too,i may not believe what you say said daddy will through the door but i will fight for your right to say it so wouldn t she reconsider and not rush off now to some lonely empty school,roth
11847,11848,why didn t she stay and talk it over,after all grandma had been baking all week and for her,roth
11849,11850,for thanksgiving said lucy,well honey that s not much different when you think about it,roth
11851,11852,it s your first big weekend home from college there isn t one of us doesn t realize lucy,since when did anything having to do with her sacrifices her suffering bring tears to his eyes,roth
11853,11854,she could not bear the pretense,and who said she was quitting college,roth
11855,11856,he kept wandering around the house crying i wanted her to go to college but who had said she wasn t,all she had said was that she was getting married to roy or did they know why without her explaining further,roth
11857,11858,were they content to accept what she told them simply to avoid the humiliation of confronting the truth,she picked up her french grammar and threw it clear across the room,roth
11859,11860,no lucy you can not,no lucy we forbid it,roth
11861,11862,but it seemed that none of them had the conviction any longer or the endurance to go against a choice of hers,in order to survive she had set her will against theirs long was the battle of her adolescence but it was over now,roth
11863,11864,and she had won,she could do whatever in the world she marry someone she secretly despised,roth
11865,11866,when roy returned to fort kean on monday evening and switched on the light in his room he found lucy sitting in a chair by the window,what are you doing here he cried dropping his suitcase,roth
11867,11868,she heard him whistling his way up the stairs and into the bathroom,you sigh the song begins you speak and i hear overhead she even heard him flush the toilet,roth
11869,11870,then he was sliding into the room again,she s out he said shutting the door,roth
11871,11872,well she just might come home,well what s the matter with you she rose and clutched her stomach,roth
11873,11874,yes or no roy up toward his ear which was still a foot above her,he ducked away from her,roth
11875,11876,now first i m turning the lights off,just to be safe,roth
11877,11878,oh darn it,here go the lights and without pausing to hear an objection he turned them off,roth
11879,11880,okay now you don t have to look at me roy,tell me what happened over your long thanksgiving holiday,roth
11881,11882,second i m going to sit down if you don t mind,hanging over me,roth
11883,11884,it wasn t sitting she wanted it was sleep,she lowered herself onto the edge of the bed and closed her eyes,roth
11885,11886,go to mr,valerio,roth
11887,11888,run away,but neither idea made sense,roth
11889,11890,if she should see anyone it was father damrosch,but what would he do,roth
11891,11892,that was precisely his trouble he couldn t do anything,he was about as much help as saint teresa or jesus christ,roth
11893,11894,he looked so strong and listened to everything she said and said such beautiful things himself but it wasn t beautiful things she needed to hear,something had to be done,roth
11895,11896,first off he was saying don t think it was easy for me,will you stop accusing,roth
11897,11898,actually i keep wondering why i don t,why can t i just speak the simple truth,roth
11899,11900,that s what s so confused,i m not doing anything wrong,roth
11901,11902,the opposite in fact the very opposite,why don t we just tell the truth,roth
11903,11904,and another,but i do want to he said at last,roth
11905,11906,roy i think you really don t she buried her head in her hands,that s the truth isn t it,roth
11907,11908,no,and what will you do instead,roth
11909,11910,i ve been getting rid of you since july roy,i have sympathy for you,roth
11911,11912,i don t cry that easy for one thing,and as for hydrox cookies that s irrelevant to anything,roth
11913,11914,i don t even know what it s supposed to mean in fact,besides he said if you wanted to drop somebody don t worry you d drop him,roth
11915,11916,i don t have emotions like other people,don t,roth
11917,11918,please i didn t mean it,tell you plenty,roth
11919,11920,the way your uncle julian looks at me,but that was a joke,roth
11921,11922,you kissed him back,you re blind to how awful people are,roth
11923,11924,how rotten and hateful they are,why roy,roth
11925,11926,in the doorway stood the widow from whom roy rented his room mrs,blodgett a thin nervous and alert woman with a little coinslot mouth and a great capacity for expressing disapproval by merely reducing the thing in size,roth
11927,11928,she did not speak right off she did not have to,well just how did you get in here roy asked as though he were the one who was outraged,roth
11929,11930,he had moved instantly between lucy and the landlady,well how mrs,roth
11931,11932,bassart,how did she is a better question,roth
11933,11934,but he continued to hide her behind him,i said get up from that bed said mrs,roth
11935,11936,blodgett,bassart,roth
11937,11938,i ve had others like you mr,bassart,roth
11939,11940,one in and another right on his heels in,they look all right but the looks is about the whole of it,roth
11941,11942,underneath they re all the same her mouth became invisible,crooked she said,roth
11943,11944,but this is different said roy,this is mrs,roth
11945,11946,blodgett my landlady who i mentioned to you,mrs,roth
11947,11948,blodgett rubbed his hands together as though he had been awaiting this pleasure for a long this is my fiancée,why were the lights off and all that shouting asked mrs,roth
11949,11950,blodgett,shouting said roy looking around,roth
11951,11952,we were listening to music,you know i love music mrs,roth
11953,11954,blodgett looked at him in such a way as to openly admit to skepticism,the radio he said,roth
11955,11956,we just turned it off,that was the noise i guess,roth
11957,11958,we just drove down from home,we were resting,roth
11959,11960,our eyes,anyway said roy there s my suitcase,roth
11961,11962,this is a dwelling place,and i thought since she was my fiancée you wouldn t mind if we rested he smiled,roth
11963,11964,against the rules no answer,it s the truth mrs,roth
11965,11966,blodgett said roy,that s why we came down late from home,roth
11967,11968,making plans he said with another big smile then he turned somber and penitent,blodgett,roth
11969,11970,blodgett she could be lying,with this face,roth
11971,11972,come on mrs,blodgett he said winningly,roth
11973,11974,she s the girl next door,i had a boy in who had a fiancée,roth
11975,11976,but he came to me mr,we then arranged that she might come here to visit until ten in the evening,roth
11977,11978,i did not even have to make it clear that the door to the room was to be left open,miss nelson i am not a closeminded person but where i have my rules i am strict,roth
11979,11980,this happens to be my dwelling place and not some flybynight person s hotel,without rules it would go to rack and ruin inside of a month,roth
11981,11982,maybe you ll understand how that happens when you re older,don t ever try to trick me again mr,roth
11983,11984,lucy nelson,miss pardee correct,roth
11985,11986,blodgett turned to show him what she thought of that last remark roy smiled,i mean we re all forgiven and everything right,roth
11987,11988,bassart,my back was turned,roth
11989,11990,now the rules mrs,marriage,roth
11991,11992,oh sure,good day don t you think,roth
11993,11994,blodgett went out leaving the door ajar,bye said roy and waited until he heard the door to the back parlor being closed before he fell into a chair,roth
11995,11996,shhhhh up out of the chair,will he said all at once for the parlor door had opened and mrs,roth
11997,11998,blodgett was headed back to the stairs,mom and dad hi mrs,roth
11999,12000,blodgett he tipped an imaginary hat,right you are mrs,roth
12001,12002,but we have,others of the older fishermen looked at him and were sad,hemingway
12003,12004,but they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen,the successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks with two men staggering at the end of each plank to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in havana,hemingway
12005,12006,those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle their livers removed their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting,when the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the terrace,hemingway
12007,12008,santiago the boy said,yes the old man said,hemingway
12009,12010,he was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago,go and play baseball,hemingway
12011,12012,if you were my boy i d take you out and gamble he said,his hope and his confidence had never gone,hemingway
12013,12014,but now they were freshening as when the breeze rises,two the boy said,hemingway
12015,12016,two the old man agreed,he was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility,hemingway
12017,12018,but he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride,tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current he said,hemingway
12019,12020,where are you going the boy asked,far out to come in when the wind shifts,hemingway
12021,12022,he never went turtleing,the old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled hardbraided brown lines the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft,hemingway
12023,12024,the box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside,no one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat,hemingway
12025,12026,they walked up the road together to the old man s shack and went in through its open door,the old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it,hemingway
12027,12028,the mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack,the shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed a table one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal,hemingway
12029,12030,on the brown walls of the flattened overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the sacred heart of jesus and another of the virgin of cobre,these were relics of his wife,hemingway
12031,12032,once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt,what do you have to eat the boy asked,hemingway
12033,12034,a pot of yellow rice with fish,i will eat at home,hemingway
12035,12036,i will make it later on,but they went through this fiction every day,hemingway
12037,12038,there was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too,eightyfive is a lucky number the old man said,hemingway
12039,12040,but the old man brought it out from under the bed,perico gave it to me at the bodega he explained,hemingway
12041,12042,i ll be back when i have the sardines,i ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning,hemingway
12043,12044,that s two dollars and a half,but i try not to borrow,hemingway
12045,12046,first you borrow,when the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down,hemingway
12047,12048,the boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man s shoulders,they were strange shoulders still powerful although very old and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward,hemingway
12049,12050,his shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun,the old man s head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face,hemingway
12051,12052,the newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze,he was barefooted,hemingway
12053,12054,the boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep,wake up old man the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man s knees,hemingway
12055,12056,the old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away,then he smiled,hemingway
12057,12058,what have you got he asked,supper said the boy,hemingway
12059,12060,then he started to fold the blanket,keep the blanket around you the boy said,hemingway
12061,12062,the two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set,the boy thought,hemingway
12063,12064,the village water supply was two streets down the road,i must have water here for him the boy thought and soap and a good towel,hemingway
12065,12066,why am i so thoughtless,i must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket,hemingway
12067,12068,your stew is excellent the old man said,tell me about the baseball the boy asked him,hemingway
12069,12070,in the american league it is the yankees as i said the old man said happily,they lost today the boy told him,hemingway
12071,12072,that means nothing,but he makes the difference,hemingway
12073,12074,in the other league between brooklyn and philadelphia i must take brooklyn,i wanted to take him fishing but i was too timid to ask him,hemingway
12075,12076,it was a great mistake,he might have gone with us,hemingway
12077,12078,they say his father was a fisherman,tell me about the great john j mcgraw he said jota for j,hemingway
12079,12080,he used to come to the terrace sometimes too in the older days,but he was rough and harshspoken and difficult when he was drinking,hemingway
12081,12082,his mind was on horses as well as baseball,there are many good fishermen and some great ones,hemingway
12083,12084,you make me happy,age is my alarm clock the old man said,hemingway
12085,12086,why do old men wake so early,they had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark,hemingway
12087,12088,he rolled his trousers up to make a pillow putting the newspaper inside them,he rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed,hemingway
12089,12090,he was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches so white they hurt your eyes and the high capes and the great brown mountains,he lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it,hemingway
12091,12092,he smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of africa that the land breeze brought at morning,usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy,hemingway
12093,12094,but tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the canary islands,he no longer dreamed of storms nor of women nor of great occurrences nor of great fish nor fights nor contests of strength nor of his wife,hemingway
12095,12096,he only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach,they played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy,hemingway
12097,12098,he never dreamed about the boy,he simply woke looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on,hemingway
12099,12100,he urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy,he was shivering with the morning cold,hemingway
12101,12102,but he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing,the door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet,hemingway
12103,12104,the boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon,he took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him,hemingway
12105,12106,the old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and sitting on the bed pulled them on,the old man went out the door and the boy came after him,hemingway
12107,12108,when they reached the old man s shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder,do you want coffee the boy asked,hemingway
12109,12110,how did you sleep old man the boy asked,he was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep,hemingway
12111,12112,very well manolin the old man said,now i must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits,hemingway
12113,12114,he brings our gear himself,i ll be right back,hemingway
12115,12116,have another coffee,the old man drank his coffee slowly,hemingway
12117,12118,it was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it,for a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch,hemingway
12119,12120,he had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day,the boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff feeling the pebbled sand under their feet and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water,hemingway
12121,12122,he fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water he began to row out of the harbour in the dark,there were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills,hemingway
12123,12124,sometimes someone would speak in a boat,but most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars,hemingway
12125,12126,they spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish,the old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean,hemingway
12127,12128,he saw the phosphorescence of the gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean,here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them,hemingway
12129,12130,in the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness,he was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean,hemingway
12131,12132,he was sorry for the birds especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding and he thought the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones,why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel,hemingway
12133,12134,she is kind and very beautiful,but she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly dipping and hunting with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea,hemingway
12135,12136,he always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in spanish when they love her,sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman,hemingway
12137,12138,some of the younger fishermen those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats bought when the shark livers had brought much money spoke of her as el mar which is masculine,they spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy,hemingway
12139,12140,but the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them,the moon affects her as it does a woman he thought,hemingway
12141,12142,he was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current,he was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour,hemingway
12143,12144,i worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing he thought,today i ll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them,hemingway
12145,12146,before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current,one bait was down forty fathoms,hemingway
12147,12148,the second was at seventyfive and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twentyfive fathoms,each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook the curve and the point was covered with fresh sardines,hemingway
12149,12150,each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a halfgarland on the projecting steel,there was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting,hemingway
12151,12152,the boy had given him two fresh small tunas or albacores which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and on the others he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness,each line as thick around as a big pencil was looped onto a greensapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two fortyfathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that if it were necessary a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line,hemingway
12153,12154,now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths,it was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise,hemingway
12155,12156,the sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats low on the water and well in toward the shore spread out across the current,then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then as it rose clear the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it,hemingway
12157,12158,he looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water,he kept them straighter than anyone did so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there,hemingway
12159,12160,others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred,but he thought i keep them with precision,hemingway
12161,12162,only i have no luck anymore,but who knows,hemingway
12163,12164,maybe today,every day is a new day,hemingway
12165,12166,it is better to be lucky,but i would rather be exact,hemingway
12167,12168,then when luck comes you are ready,the sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east,hemingway
12169,12170,there were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore,all my life the early sun has hurt my eyes he thought,hemingway
12171,12172,yet they are still good,in the evening i can look straight into it without getting the blackness,hemingway
12173,12174,it has more force in the evening too,but in the morning it is painful,hemingway
12175,12176,just then he saw a manofwar bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him,he made a quick drop slanting down on his backswept wings and then circled again,hemingway
12177,12178,he s got something the old man said aloud,he did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down,hemingway
12179,12180,but he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird,the bird went higher in the air and circled again his wings motionless,hemingway
12181,12182,then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface,dolphin the old man said aloud,hemingway
12183,12184,it had a wire leader and a mediumsized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines,he let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern,hemingway
12185,12186,then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow,he went back to rowing and to watching the longwinged black bird who was working now low over the water,hemingway
12187,12188,as he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish,the old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish,hemingway
12189,12190,the dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water driving at speed when the fish dropped,it is a big school of dolphin he thought,hemingway
12191,12192,they are widespread and the flying fish have little chance,the bird has no chance,hemingway
12193,12194,the flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast,he watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird,hemingway
12195,12196,that school has gotten away from me he thought,they are moving out too fast and too far,hemingway
12197,12198,but perhaps i will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them,my big fish must be somewhere,hemingway
12199,12200,the clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it,the water was a dark blue now so dark that it was almost purple,hemingway
12201,12202,as he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now,he watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish,hemingway
12203,12204,the strange light the sun made in the water now that the sun was higher meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land,but the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow sunbleached sargasso weed and the purple formalized iridescent gelatinous bladder of a portuguese manofwar floating close beside the boat,hemingway
12205,12206,it turned on its side and then righted itself,it floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water,hemingway
12207,12208,agua mala the man said,they were immune to its poison,hemingway
12209,12210,but men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give,but these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash,hemingway
12211,12212,the iridescent bubbles were beautiful,but they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them,hemingway
12213,12214,the turtles saw them approached them from the front then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all,the old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet,hemingway
12215,12216,he loved green turtles and hawkbills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge stupid loggerheads yellow in their armourplating strange in their lovemaking and happily eating the portuguese menofwar with their eyes shut,he had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years,hemingway
12217,12218,he was sorry for them all even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton,most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered,hemingway
12219,12220,but the old man thought i have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs,he ate the white eggs to give himself strength,hemingway
12221,12222,he ate them all through may to be strong in september and october for the truly big fish,he also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear,hemingway
12223,12224,it was there for all fishermen who wanted it,most fishermen hated the taste,hemingway
12225,12226,but it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes,now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again,hemingway
12227,12228,he s found fish he said aloud,no flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish,hemingway
12229,12230,but as the old man watched a small tuna rose in the air turned and dropped head first into the water,the tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait,hemingway
12231,12232,they were circling it and driving it,if they don t travel too fast i will get into them the old man thought and he watched the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic,hemingway
12233,12234,the bird is a great help the old man said,just then the stern line came taut under his foot where he had kept a loop of the line and he dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna s shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in,hemingway
12235,12236,the shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat,he lay in the stern in the sun compact and bullet shaped his big unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat fastmoving tail,hemingway
12237,12238,the old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him his body still shuddering under the shade of the stern,albacore he said aloud,hemingway
12239,12240,he ll make a beautiful bait,he had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats,hemingway
12241,12242,he had probably started to talk aloud when alone when the boy had left,but he did not remember,hemingway
12243,12244,when he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was necessary,they talked at night or when they were stormbound by bad weather,hemingway
12245,12246,it was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always considered it so and respected it,but now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy,hemingway
12247,12248,if the others heard me talking out loud they would think that i am crazy he said aloud,but since i am not crazy i do not care,hemingway
12249,12250,now is the time to think of only one thing,that which i was born for,hemingway
12251,12252,there might be a big one around that school he thought,i picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding,hemingway
12253,12254,but they are working far out and fast,everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the northeast,hemingway
12255,12256,can that be the time of day,or is it some sign of weather that i do not know,hemingway
12257,12258,he could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed white as though they were snowcapped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above them,the sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water,hemingway
12259,12260,the myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep,the tuna the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits were down again,hemingway
12261,12262,the sun was hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed,i could just drift he thought and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me,hemingway
12263,12264,but today is eightyfive days and i should fish the day well,just then watching his lines he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply,hemingway
12265,12266,yes he said,yes and shipped his oars without bumping the boat,hemingway
12267,12268,he reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand,he felt no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly,hemingway
12269,12270,then it came again,this time it was a tentative pull not solid nor heavy and he knew exactly what it was,hemingway
12271,12272,one hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the handforged hook projected from the head of the small tuna,the old man held the line delicately and softly with his left hand unleashed it from the stick,hemingway
12273,12274,now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension,this far out he must be huge in this month he thought,hemingway
12275,12276,eat them fish,eat them,hemingway
12277,12278,please eat them,how fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark,hemingway
12279,12280,make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them,he felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine s head must have been more difficult to break from the hook,hemingway
12281,12282,then there was nothing,come on the old man said aloud,hemingway
12283,12284,make another turn,just smell them,hemingway
12285,12286,aren t they lovely,eat them good now and then there is the tuna,hemingway
12287,12288,hard and cold and lovely,don t be shy fish,hemingway
12289,12290,then came the same delicate pulling touch again,he ll take it the old man said aloud,hemingway
12291,12292,he was gone and the old man felt nothing,he can t have gone he said,hemingway
12293,12294,christ knows he can t have gone,he s making a turn,hemingway
12295,12296,it was only his turn he said,it was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down down down unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils,hemingway
12297,12298,as it went down slipping lightly through the old man s fingers he still could feel the great weight though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible,what a fish he said,hemingway
12299,12300,he did not say that because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen,he knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth,hemingway
12301,12302,at that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there,then the weight increased and he gave more line,hemingway
12303,12304,he tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down,he s taken it he said,hemingway
12305,12306,now he was ready,he had three fortyfathom coils of line in reserve now as well as the coil he was using,hemingway
12307,12308,eat it a little more he said,come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you,hemingway
12309,12310,all right,are you ready,hemingway
12311,12312,have you been long enough at table,now he said aloud and struck hard with both hands gained a yard of line and then struck again and again swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body,hemingway
12313,12314,nothing happened,the fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch,hemingway
12315,12316,his line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his back until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it,then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull,hemingway
12317,12318,the boat began to move slowly off toward the northwest,the fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water,hemingway
12319,12320,the other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be done,i wish i had the boy the old man said aloud,hemingway
12321,12322,i m being towed by a fish and i m the towing bitt,i could make the line fast,hemingway
12323,12324,but then he could break it,i must hold him all i can and give him line when he must have it,hemingway
12325,12326,what i ll do if he sounds and dies i don t know,but i ll do something,hemingway
12327,12328,there are plenty of things i can do,he held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the northwest,hemingway
12329,12330,this will kill him the old man thought,he can t do this forever,hemingway
12331,12332,but four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea towing the skiff and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across his back,it was noon when i hooked him he said,hemingway
12333,12334,he was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and being careful not to jerk on the line moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand,he opened it and drank a little,hemingway
12335,12336,then he rested against the bow,he rested sitting on the unstepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure,hemingway
12337,12338,then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible,that makes no difference he thought,hemingway
12339,12340,i can always come in on the glow from havana,there are two more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that,hemingway
12341,12342,if he doesn t maybe he will come up with the moon,if he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise,hemingway
12343,12344,i have no cramps and i feel strong,it is he that has the hook in his mouth,hemingway
12345,12346,but what a fish to pull like that,he must have his mouth shut tight on the wire,hemingway
12347,12348,i wish i could see him,i wish i could see him only once to know what i have against me,hemingway
12349,12350,the fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars,it was cold after the sun went down and the old man s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs,hemingway
12351,12352,during the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry,after the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now,hemingway
12353,12354,the sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable,the position actually was only somewhat less intolerable but he thought of it as almost comfortable,hemingway
12355,12356,i can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me he thought,not as long as he keeps this up,hemingway
12357,12358,once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course,the line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders,hemingway
12359,12360,they were moving more slowly now and the glow of havana was not so strong so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward,if i lose the glare of havana we must be going more to the eastward he thought,hemingway
12361,12362,for if the fish s course held true i must see it for many more hours,i wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today he thought,hemingway
12363,12364,it would be wonderful to do this with a radio,then he thought think of it always,hemingway
12365,12366,think of what you are doing,you must do nothing stupid,hemingway
12367,12368,then he said aloud i wish i had the boy,but it is unavoidable,hemingway
12369,12370,i must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong,remember no matter how little you want to that you must eat him in the morning,hemingway
12371,12372,remember he said to himself,during the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and blowing,hemingway
12373,12374,he could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female,they are good he said,hemingway
12375,12376,they play and make jokes and love one another,he is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is he thought,hemingway
12377,12378,never have i had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely,perhaps he is too wise to jump,hemingway
12379,12380,he could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush,but perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight,hemingway
12381,12382,he can not know that it is only one man against him nor that it is an old man,but what a great fish he is and what he will bring in the market if the flesh is good,hemingway
12383,12384,he took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it,i wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as i am,hemingway
12385,12386,he remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin,the male fish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish the female made a wild panicstricken despairing fight that soon exhausted her and all the time the male had stayed with her crossing the line and circling with her on the surface,hemingway
12387,12388,he had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape,when the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors and then with the boy s aid hoisted her aboard the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat,hemingway
12389,12390,then while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep his lavender wings that were his pectoral fins spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing,he was beautiful the old man remembered and he had stayed,hemingway
12391,12392,that was the saddest thing i ever saw with them the old man thought,the boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly,hemingway
12393,12394,i wish the boy was here he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen,when once through my treachery it had been necessary to him to make a choice the old man thought,hemingway
12395,12396,his choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and treacheries,my choice was to go there to find him beyond all people,hemingway
12397,12398,beyond all people in the world,now we are joined together and have been since noon,hemingway
12399,12400,and no one to help either one of us,perhaps i should not have been a fisherman he thought,hemingway
12401,12402,but that was the thing that i was born for,i must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light,hemingway
12403,12404,some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him,he heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff,hemingway
12405,12406,in the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale,then he cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils fast,hemingway
12407,12408,he worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight,now he had six reserve coils of line,hemingway
12409,12410,there were two from each bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all connected,after it is light he thought i will work back to the fortyfathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils,hemingway
12411,12412,i will have lost two hundred fathoms of good catalan cardel and the hooks and leaders,that can be replaced,hemingway
12413,12414,but who replaces this fish if i hook some fish and it cuts him off,i don t know what that fish was that took the bait just now,hemingway
12415,12416,it could have been a marlin or a broadbill or a shark,i never felt him,hemingway
12417,12418,i had to get rid of him too fast,you have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now in the dark or not in the dark and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils,hemingway
12419,12420,so he did it,it was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye,hemingway
12421,12422,the blood ran down his cheek a little way,but it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood,hemingway
12423,12424,he adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and holding it anchored with his shoulders he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water,i wonder what he made that lurch for he thought,hemingway
12425,12426,the wire must have slipped on the great hill of his back,certainly his back can not feel as badly as mine does,hemingway
12427,12428,but he can not pull this skiff forever no matter how great he is,now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and i have a big reserve of line all that a man can ask,hemingway
12429,12430,it was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm,i can do it as long as he can he thought,hemingway
12431,12432,and in the first light the line extended out and down into the water,the boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old man s right shoulder,hemingway
12433,12434,he s headed north the old man said,the current will have set us far to the eastward he thought,hemingway
12435,12436,i wish he would turn with the current,that would show that he was tiring,hemingway
12437,12438,when the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring,there was only one favorable sign,hemingway
12439,12440,the slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth,that did not necessarily mean that he would jump,hemingway
12441,12442,but he might,god let him jump the old man said,hemingway
12443,12444,now that it is daylight let him jump so that he ll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he can not go deep to die,he tried to increase the tension but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it,hemingway
12445,12446,i must not jerk it ever he thought,each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it,hemingway
12447,12448,anyway i feel better with the sun and for once i do not have to look into it,there was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased,hemingway
12449,12450,it was the yellow gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night,fish he said i love you and respect you very much,hemingway
12451,12452,a small bird came toward the skiff from the north,he was a warbler and flying very low over the water,hemingway
12453,12454,the old man could see that he was very tired,the bird made the stern of the boat and rested there,hemingway
12455,12456,then he flew around the old man s head and rested on the line where he was more comfortable,how old are you the old man asked the bird,hemingway
12457,12458,he was too tired even to examine the line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast,it s steady the old man told him,hemingway
12459,12460,it s too steady,you shouldn t be that tired after a windless night,hemingway
12461,12462,but he said nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough,take a good rest small bird he said,hemingway
12463,12464,stay at my house if you like bird he said,i am sorry i can not hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising,hemingway
12465,12466,the bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go,he felt the line carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding,hemingway
12467,12468,something hurt him then he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the fish,but when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line,hemingway
12469,12470,you re feeling it now fish he said,the bird was gone,hemingway
12471,12472,you did not stay long the man thought,but it is rougher where you are going until you make the shore,hemingway
12473,12474,how did i let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made,i must be getting very stupid,hemingway
12475,12476,or perhaps i was looking at the small bird and thinking of him,now i will pay attention to my work and then i must eat the tuna so that i will not have a failure of strength,hemingway
12477,12478,i wish the boy were here and that i had some salt he said aloud,shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in the ocean and held it there submerged for more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved,hemingway
12479,12480,he has slowed much he said,the old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against the sun,hemingway
12481,12482,it was only a line burn that had cut his flesh,but it was in the working part of his hand,hemingway
12483,12484,he knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started,now he said when his hand had dried i must eat the small tuna,hemingway
12485,12486,holding the line with his left shoulder again and bracing on his left hand and arm he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place,he put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail,hemingway
12487,12488,they were wedgeshaped strips and he cut them from next to the backbone down to the edge of the belly,when he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow wiped his knife on his trousers and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard,hemingway
12489,12490,i don t think i can eat an entire one he said and drew his knife across one of the strips,he could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped,hemingway
12491,12492,it drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust,what kind of a hand is that he said,hemingway
12493,12494,cramp then if you want,make yourself into a claw,hemingway
12495,12496,eat it now and it will strengthen the hand,it is not the hand s fault and you have been many hours with the fish,hemingway
12497,12498,but you can stay with him forever,eat the bonito now,hemingway
12499,12500,he picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly,it was not unpleasant,hemingway
12501,12502,chew it well he thought and get all the juices,it would not be bad to eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt,hemingway
12503,12504,how do you feel hand he asked the cramped hand that was almost as stiff as rigor mortis,he chewed it carefully and then spat out the skin,hemingway
12505,12506,how does it go hand,it is a strong fullblooded fish he thought,hemingway
12507,12508,i was lucky to get him instead of dolphin,dolphin is too sweet,hemingway
12509,12510,i wish i had some salt,and i do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left so i had better eat it all although i am not hungry,hemingway
12511,12512,the fish is calm and steady,i will eat it all and then i will be ready,hemingway
12513,12514,be patient hand he said,he is my brother,hemingway
12515,12516,but i must kill him and keep strong to do it,slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedgeshaped strips of fish,hemingway
12517,12518,he straightened up wiping his hand on his trousers,now he said,hemingway
12519,12520,you can let the cord go hand and i will handle him with the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense he put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back,god help me to have the cramp go he said,hemingway
12521,12522,but what is his plan he thought,and what is mine,hemingway
12523,12524,mine i must improvise to his because of his great size,if he will jump i can kill him,hemingway
12525,12526,but he stays down forever,then i will stay down with him forever,hemingway
12527,12528,he rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers,but it would not open,hemingway
12529,12530,maybe it will open with the sun he thought,maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna is digested,hemingway
12531,12532,if i have to have it i will open it cost whatever it costs,but i do not want to open it now by force,hemingway
12533,12534,let it open by itself and come back of its own accord,after all i abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and untie the various lines,hemingway
12535,12536,he looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now,but he could see the prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm,hemingway
12537,12538,the clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water then blurring then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea,he thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boat and knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather,hemingway
12539,12540,but now they were in hurricane months and when there are no hurricanes the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year,if there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead if you are at sea,hemingway
12541,12542,they do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for he thought,the land must make a difference too in the shape of the clouds,hemingway
12543,12544,but we have no hurricane coming now,he looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high september sky,hemingway
12545,12546,light brisa he said,i hate a cramp he thought,hemingway
12547,12548,it is a treachery of one s own body,it is humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it,hemingway
12549,12550,but a cramp he thought of it as a calambre humiliates oneself especially when one is alone,if the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm he thought,hemingway
12551,12552,but it will loosen up,then with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water,hemingway
12553,12554,then as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward,he s coming up he said,hemingway
12555,12556,come on hand,he came out unendingly and water poured from his sides,hemingway
12557,12558,he was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender,his sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then reentered it smoothly like a diver and the old man saw the great scytheblade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out,hemingway
12559,12560,he is two feet longer than the skiff the old man said,the line was going out fast but steadily and the fish was not panicked,hemingway
12561,12562,the old man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside of breaking strength,he knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it,hemingway
12563,12564,he is a great fish and i must convince him he thought,i must never let him learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run,hemingway
12565,12566,if i were him i would put in everything now and go until something broke,but thank god they are not as intelligent as we who kill them although they are more noble and more able,hemingway
12567,12568,the old man had seen many great fish,he had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life but never alone,hemingway
12569,12570,now alone and out of sight of land he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle,it will uncramp though he thought,hemingway
12571,12572,surely it will uncramp to help my right hand,there are three things that are brothers the fish and my two hands,hemingway
12573,12574,it must uncramp,it is unworthy of it to be cramped,hemingway
12575,12576,the fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace,i wonder why he jumped the old man thought,hemingway
12577,12578,he jumped almost as though to show me how big he was,i know now anyway he thought,hemingway
12579,12580,i wish i could show him what sort of man i am,but then he would see the cramped hand,hemingway
12581,12582,let him think i am more man than i am and i will be so,i wish i was the fish he thought with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence,hemingway
12583,12584,he settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water,there was a small sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man s left hand was uncramped,hemingway
12585,12586,bad news for you fish he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders,he was comfortable but suffering although he did not admit the suffering at all,hemingway
12587,12588,i am not religious he said,but i will say ten our fathers and ten hail marys that i should catch this fish and i promise to make a pilgrimage to the virgin of cobre if i catch him,hemingway
12589,12590,sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically,hail marys are easier to say than our fathers he thought,hemingway
12591,12592,hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee,blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus,hemingway
12593,12594,holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death,amen then he added blessed virgin pray for the death of this fish,hemingway
12595,12596,the sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently,i had better rebait that little line out over the stern he said,hemingway
12597,12598,if the fish decides to stay another night i will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle,i don t think i can get anything but a dolphin here,hemingway
12599,12600,but if i eat him fresh enough he won t be bad,i wish a flying fish would come on board tonight,hemingway
12601,12602,but i have no light to attract them,a flying fish is excellent to eat raw and i would not have to cut him up,hemingway
12603,12604,i must save all my strength now,but i will show him what a man can do and what a man endures,hemingway
12605,12606,i told the boy i was a strange old man he said,now he was proving it again,hemingway
12607,12608,each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it,i wish he d sleep and i could sleep and dream about the lions he thought,hemingway
12609,12610,why are the lions the main thing that is left,don t think old man he said to himself,hemingway
12611,12612,rest gently now against the wood and think of nothing,he is working,hemingway
12613,12614,work as little as you can,it was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily,hemingway
12615,12616,but there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly,once in the afternoon the line started to rise again,hemingway
12617,12618,but the fish only continued to swim at a slightly higher level,the sun was on the old man s left arm and shoulder and on his back,hemingway
12619,12620,so he knew the fish had turned east of north,now that he had seen him once he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark,hemingway
12621,12622,i wonder how much he sees at that depth the old man thought,his eye is huge and a horse with much less eye can see in the dark,hemingway
12623,12624,once i could see quite well in the dark,not in the absolute dark,hemingway
12625,12626,but almost as a cat sees,the sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little,hemingway
12627,12628,he thought of the big leagues to him they were the gran ligas and he knew that the yankees of new york were playing the tigres of detroit,this is the second day now that i do not know the result of the juegos he thought,hemingway
12629,12630,but i must have confidence and i must be worthy of the great dimaggio who does all things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel,what is a bone spur,hemingway
12631,12632,he asked himself,un espuela de hueso,hemingway
12633,12634,we do not have them,can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in one s heel,hemingway
12635,12636,i do not think i could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do,man is not much beside the great birds and beasts,hemingway
12637,12638,still i would rather be that beast down there in the darkness of the sea,unless sharks come he said aloud,hemingway
12639,12640,he thought,i am sure he would and more since he is young and strong,hemingway
12641,12642,also his father was a fisherman,but would the bone spur hurt him too much,hemingway
12643,12644,i do not know he said aloud,they had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight,hemingway
12645,12646,each one was trying to force the other s hand down onto the table,there was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro s face,hemingway
12647,12648,they changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep,blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro s hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched,hemingway
12649,12650,the walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them,the negro s shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps,hemingway
12651,12652,the odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted cigarettes for him,then the negro after the rum would try for a tremendous effort and once he had the old man who was not an old man then but was santiago el campeón nearly three inches off balance,hemingway
12653,12654,but the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again,he was sure then that he had the negro who was a fine man and a great athlete beaten,hemingway
12655,12656,and at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood,the match had started on a sunday morning and ended on a monday morning,hemingway
12657,12658,many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the havana coal company,otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish,hemingway
12659,12660,but he had finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work,for a long time after that everyone had called him the champion and there had been a return match in the spring,hemingway
12661,12662,but not much money was bet and he had won it quite easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from cienfuegos in the first match,after that he had a few matches and then no more,hemingway
12663,12664,he decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing,he had tried a few practice matches with his left hand,hemingway
12665,12666,but his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it,the sun will bake it out well now he thought,hemingway
12667,12668,it should not cramp on me again unless it gets too cold in the night,i wonder what this night will bring,hemingway
12669,12670,an airplane passed overhead on its course to miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of flying fish,with so much flying fish there should be dolphin he said and leaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish,hemingway
12671,12672,but he could not and it stayed at the hardness and waterdrop shivering that preceded breaking,the boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it,hemingway
12673,12674,it must be very strange in an airplane he thought,i wonder what the sea looks like from that height,hemingway
12675,12676,they should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high,i would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above,hemingway
12677,12678,in the turtle boats i was in the crosstrees of the masthead and even at that height i saw much,the dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple spots and you can see all of the school as they swim,hemingway
12679,12680,why is it that all the fastmoving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots,the dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden,hemingway
12681,12682,but when he comes to feed truly hungry purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin,can it be anger or the greater speed he makes that brings them out,hemingway
12683,12684,just before it was dark as they passed a great island of sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket his small line was taken by a dolphin,he saw it first when it jumped in the air true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air,hemingway
12685,12686,it jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot,when the fish was at the stern plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation the old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stern,hemingway
12687,12688,its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still,the old man unhooked the fish rebaited the line with another sardine and tossed it over,hemingway
12689,12690,then he worked his way slowly back to the bow,he washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers,hemingway
12691,12692,then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord,he hasn t changed at all he said,hemingway
12693,12694,but watching the movement of the water against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower,i ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night he said,hemingway
12695,12696,i can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time,i had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset,hemingway
12697,12698,the setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish,he let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much or more than he did,hemingway
12699,12700,i m learning how to do it he thought,this part of it anyway,hemingway
12701,12702,then too remember he hasn t eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food,i have eaten the whole bonito,hemingway
12703,12704,tomorrow i will eat the dolphin,he called it dorado,hemingway
12705,12706,perhaps i should eat some of it when i clean it,it will be harder to eat than the bonito,hemingway
12707,12708,but then nothing is easy,how do you feel fish he asked aloud,hemingway
12709,12710,i feel good and my left hand is better and i have food for a night and a day,but i have had worse things than that he thought,hemingway
12711,12712,my hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other,my legs are all right,hemingway
12713,12714,also now i have gained on him in the question of sustenance,it was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in september,hemingway
12715,12716,he lay against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could,the first stars were out,hemingway
12717,12718,he did not know the name of rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant friends,the fish is my friend too he said aloud,hemingway
12719,12720,i have never seen or heard of such a fish,but i must kill him,hemingway
12721,12722,the moon runs away,but imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun,hemingway
12723,12724,we were born lucky he thought,then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him,hemingway
12725,12726,how many people will he feed he thought,but are they worthy to eat him,hemingway
12727,12728,no of course not,there is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity,hemingway
12729,12730,i do not understand these things he thought,but it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars,hemingway
12731,12732,it is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers,now he thought i must think about the drag,hemingway
12733,12734,it has its perils and its merits,i may lose so much line that i will lose him if he makes his effort and the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness,hemingway
12735,12736,her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed,no matter what passes i must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be strong,hemingway
12737,12738,now i will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before i move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision,in the meantime i can see how he acts and if he shows any changes,hemingway
12739,12740,the oars are a good trick but it has reached the time to play for safety,he is much fish still and i saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut,hemingway
12741,12742,the punishment of the hook is nothing,the punishment of hunger and that he is against something that he does not comprehend is everything,hemingway
12743,12744,rest now old man and let him work until your next duty comes,he rested for what he believed to be two hours,hemingway
12745,12746,the moon did not rise now until late and he had no way of judging the time,nor was he really resting except comparatively,hemingway
12747,12748,he was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself,how simple it would be if i could make the line fast he thought,hemingway
12749,12750,but with one small lurch he could break it,i must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line with both hands,hemingway
12751,12752,but you have not slept yet old man he said aloud,it is half a day and a night and now another day and you have not slept,hemingway
12753,12754,you must devise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and steady,too clear,hemingway
12755,12756,i am as clear as the stars that are my brothers,still i must sleep,hemingway
12757,12758,they sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm,but remember to sleep he thought,hemingway
12759,12760,make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way about the lines,now go back and prepare the dolphin,hemingway
12761,12762,it is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep,i could go without sleeping he told himself,hemingway
12763,12764,but it would be too dangerous,he started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees being careful not to jerk against the fish,hemingway
12765,12766,he may be half asleep himself he thought,but i do not want him to rest,hemingway
12767,12768,he must pull until he dies,back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand,hemingway
12769,12770,the stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the stern,he put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw,hemingway
12771,12772,then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear,he felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open,hemingway
12773,12774,there were two flying fish inside,they were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills over the stern,hemingway
12775,12776,they sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water,the dolphin was cold and a leprous graywhite now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish s head,hemingway
12777,12778,then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail,he slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water,hemingway
12779,12780,but there was only the light of its slow descent,he turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath he worked his way slowly back to the bow,hemingway
12781,12782,his back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand,back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them,hemingway
12783,12784,after that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand resting on the gunwale,then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water noting the speed of the water against his hand,hemingway
12785,12786,his hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it,the flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern,hemingway
12787,12788,he is tiring or he is resting the old man said,what an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked he said,hemingway
12789,12790,and what a miserable fish raw,but then i did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset,hemingway
12791,12792,still it was a lack of preparation,but i have chewed it all well and i am not nauseated,hemingway
12793,12794,the sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone,it looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped,hemingway
12795,12796,there will be bad weather in three or four days he said,but not tonight and not tomorrow,hemingway
12797,12798,then he passed the line a little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it,my right hand can hold it as long as it is braced he thought,hemingway
12799,12800,if it relaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goes out,it is hard on the right hand,hemingway
12801,12802,but he is used to punishment,even if i sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good,hemingway
12803,12804,he lay forward cramping himself against the line with all of his body putting all his weight onto his right hand and he was asleep,he did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped,hemingway
12805,12806,then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow,after that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening offshore breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy,hemingway
12807,12808,the moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds,he woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his right hand,hemingway
12809,12810,he had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed out,finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly,hemingway
12811,12812,he looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly,just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall,hemingway
12813,12814,then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again,he had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move,hemingway
12815,12816,this is what we waited for he thought,so now let us take it,hemingway
12817,12818,make him pay for the line he thought,make him pay for it,hemingway
12819,12820,he could not see the fish s jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he fell,the speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers,hemingway
12821,12822,if the boy was here he would wet the coils of line he thought,yes,hemingway
12823,12824,if the boy were here,if the boy were here,hemingway
12825,12826,the line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each inch of it,now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed,hemingway
12827,12828,then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet,he was ceding line but more slowly all he time,hemingway
12829,12830,he worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see,there was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water,hemingway
12831,12832,yes he thought,and now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he can not go down deep to die where i can not bring him up,hemingway
12833,12834,he will start circling soon and then i must work on him,i wonder what started him so suddenly,hemingway
12835,12836,could it have been hunger that made him desperate or was he frightened by something in the night,maybe he suddenly felt fear,hemingway
12837,12838,but he was such a calm strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident,it is strange,hemingway
12839,12840,you better be fearless and confident yourself old man he said,you re holding him again but you can not get line,hemingway
12841,12842,he was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength,when his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise,hemingway
12843,12844,he s headed almost east he thought,that means he is tired and going with the current,hemingway
12845,12846,soon he will have to circle,then our true work begins,hemingway
12847,12848,after he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it,it is not bad he said,hemingway
12849,12850,you did not do so badly for something worthless he said to his left hand,he thought,hemingway
12851,12852,perhaps it was my fault in not training that one properly,but god knows he has had enough chances to learn,hemingway
12853,12854,he did not do so badly in the night though and he has only cramped once,if he cramps again let the line cut him off,hemingway
12855,12856,when he thought that he knew that he was not being clearheaded and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin,but i can t he told himself,hemingway
12857,12858,it is better to be lightheaded than to lose your strength from nausea,and i know i can not keep it if i eat it since my face was in it,hemingway
12859,12860,i will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad,but it is too late to try for strength now through nourishment,hemingway
12861,12862,you re stupid he told himself,eat the other flying fish,hemingway
12863,12864,it was there cleaned and ready and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail,it has more nourishment than almost any fish he thought,hemingway
12865,12866,at least the kind of strength that i need,now i have done what i can he thought,hemingway
12867,12868,let him begin to circle and let the fight come,the sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle,hemingway
12869,12870,he could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling,it was too early for that,hemingway
12871,12872,he just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand,it tightened as always but just when he reached the point where it would break line began to come in,hemingway
12873,12874,he slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently,he used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his legs,hemingway
12875,12876,his old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling,it is a very big circle he said,hemingway
12877,12878,then it started out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water,he is making the far part of his circle now he said,hemingway
12879,12880,i must hold all i can he thought,the strain will shorten his circle each time,hemingway
12881,12882,perhaps in an hour i will see him,now i must convince him and then i must kill him,hemingway
12883,12884,but the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his bones two hours later,but the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam,hemingway
12885,12886,for an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead,he was not afraid of the black spots,hemingway
12887,12888,they were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line,twice though he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him,hemingway
12889,12890,i could not fail myself and die on a fish like this he said,now that i have him coming so beautifully god help me endure,hemingway
12891,12892,i ll say a hundred our fathers and a hundred hail marys,i ll say them later,hemingway
12893,12894,just then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands,it was sharp and hardfeeling and heavy,hemingway
12895,12896,he is hitting the wire leader with his spear he thought,that was bound to come,hemingway
12897,12898,he had to do that,it may make him jump though and i would rather he stayed circling now,hemingway
12899,12900,the jumps were necessary for him to take air,but after that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook,hemingway
12901,12902,don t jump fish he said,i must hold his pain where it is he thought,hemingway
12903,12904,mine does not matter,i can control mine,hemingway
12905,12906,but his pain could drive him mad,after a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again,hemingway
12907,12908,the old man was gaining line steadily now,but he felt faint again,hemingway
12909,12910,he lifted some sea water with his left hand and put it on his head,then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck,hemingway
12911,12912,i have no cramps he said,he ll be up soon and i can last,hemingway
12913,12914,you have to last,i ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in he decided,hemingway
12915,12916,it was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself without recovering any line,but when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the boat the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained,hemingway
12917,12918,i m tireder than i have ever been he thought and now the trade wind is rising,but that will be good to take him in with,hemingway
12919,12920,i need that badly,i ll rest on the next turn as he goes out he said,hemingway
12921,12922,i feel much better,you work now fish he thought,hemingway
12923,12924,i ll take you at the turn,the sea had risen considerably,hemingway
12925,12926,but it was a fairweather breeze and he had to have it to get home,i ll just steer south and west he said,hemingway
12927,12928,he saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believe its length,no he said,hemingway
12929,12930,it was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water,it raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him,hemingway
12931,12932,his dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide,on this circle the old man could see the fish s eye and the two gray sucking fish that swam around him,hemingway
12933,12934,sometimes they attached themselves to him,sometimes they darted off,hemingway
12935,12936,sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow,they were each over three feet long and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels,hemingway
12937,12938,the old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun,on each calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in,hemingway
12939,12940,but i must get him close close close he thought,i mustn t try for the head,hemingway
12941,12942,i must get the heart,be calm and strong old man he said,hemingway
12943,12944,on the next circle the fish s back was out but he was a little too far from the boat,on the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside,hemingway
12945,12946,he had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow,the fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail moving,hemingway
12947,12948,the old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer,for just a moment the fish turned a little on his side,hemingway
12949,12950,then he straightened himself and began another circle,i moved him the old man said,hemingway
12951,12952,i moved him he thought,maybe this time i can get him over,hemingway
12953,12954,pull hands he thought,hold up legs,hemingway
12955,12956,last for me head,last for me,hemingway
12957,12958,you never went,this time i ll pull him over,hemingway
12959,12960,but when he put all of his effort on starting it well out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away,fish the old man said,hemingway
12961,12962,fish you are going to have to die anyway,his mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now,hemingway
12963,12964,i must get him alongside this time he thought,i am not good for many more turns,hemingway
12965,12966,yes you are he told himself,you re good for ever,hemingway
12967,12968,on the next turn he nearly had him,but again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away,hemingway
12969,12970,you are killing me fish the old man thought,but you have a right to,hemingway
12971,12972,never have i seen a greater or more beautiful or a calmer or more noble thing than you brother,come on and kill me,hemingway
12973,12974,i do not care who kills who,now you are getting confused in the head he thought,hemingway
12975,12976,you must keep your head clear,keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man,hemingway
12977,12978,or a fish he thought,clear up head he said in a voice he could hardly hear,hemingway
12979,12980,i do not know the old man thought,he had been on the point of feeling himself go each time,hemingway
12981,12982,i do not know,but i will try it once more,hemingway
12983,12984,he tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish,the fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air,hemingway
12985,12986,i ll try it again the old man promised although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes,he tried it again and it was the same,hemingway
12987,12988,so he thought and he felt himself going before he started i will try it once again,he took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it against the fish s agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat long deep wide silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water,hemingway
12989,12990,the old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength and more strength he had just summoned into the fish s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man s chest,he felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it,hemingway
12991,12992,then the fish came alive with his death in him and rose high out of the water showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty,he seemed to hang in the air above the old man in the skiff,hemingway
12993,12994,then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff,the old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well,hemingway
12995,12996,but he cleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and when he could see he saw the fish was on his back with his silver belly up,the shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish s shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart,hemingway
12997,12998,first it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep,then it spread like a cloud,hemingway
12999,13000,the fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves,the old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had,hemingway
13001,13002,then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid his head on his hands,keep my head clear he said against the wood of the bow,hemingway
13003,13004,i am a tired old man,even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out this skiff would never hold him,hemingway
13005,13006,i must prepare everything then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home,he started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow,hemingway
13007,13008,i want to see him he thought and to touch and to feel him,he is my fortune he thought,hemingway
13009,13010,but that is not why i wish to feel him,i think i felt his heart he thought,hemingway
13011,13012,when i pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time,bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff,hemingway
13013,13014,get to work old man he said,he took a very small drink of the water,hemingway
13015,13016,he looked at the sun carefully,it is not much more than noon he thought,hemingway
13017,13018,and the trade wind is rising,the lines all mean nothing now,hemingway
13019,13020,the boy and i will splice them when we are home,come on fish he said,hemingway
13021,13022,but the fish did not come,instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff up onto him,hemingway
13023,13024,when he was even with him and had the fish s head against the bow he could not believe his size,but he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt passed it through the fish s gills and out his jaws made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow,hemingway
13025,13026,he cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail,the fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail,hemingway
13027,13028,they were wider than a man s hand with his fingers spread and the fish s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a procession,it was the only way to kill him the old man said,hemingway
13029,13030,he was feeling better since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear,he s over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is he thought,hemingway
13031,13032,maybe much more,if he dresses out twothirds of that at thirty cents a pound,hemingway
13033,13034,i need a pencil for that he said,my head is not that clear,hemingway
13035,13036,but i think the great dimaggio would be proud of me today,i had no bone spurs,hemingway
13037,13038,but the hands and the back hurt truly i wonder what a bone spur is he thought,maybe we have them without knowing of it,hemingway
13039,13040,he made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart,he was so big it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside,hemingway
13041,13042,he cut a piece of line and tied the fish s lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible,then he stepped the mast and with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged the patched sail drew the boat began to move and half lying in the stern he sailed southwest,hemingway
13043,13044,he did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was,he only needed the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail,hemingway
13045,13046,i better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture,but he could not find a spoon and his sardines were rotten,hemingway
13047,13048,so he hooked a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff,there were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas,hemingway
13049,13050,the old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails,they were very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good,hemingway
13051,13052,the old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had eaten the shrimps,the skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm,hemingway
13053,13054,he could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream,at one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end he had thought perhaps it was a dream,hemingway
13055,13056,then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell he was sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it,then he could not see well although now he saw as well as ever,hemingway
13057,13058,now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream,the hands cure quickly he thought,hemingway
13059,13060,i bled them clean and the salt water will heal them,the dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that there is,hemingway
13061,13062,all i must do is keep the head clear,the hands have done their work and we sail well,hemingway
13063,13064,with his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers,then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought is he bringing me in or am i bringing him in,hemingway
13065,13066,if i were towing him behind there would be no question,nor if the fish were in the skiff with all dignity gone there would be no question either,hemingway
13067,13068,but they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man thought let him bring me in if it pleases him,i am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm,hemingway
13069,13070,they sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head clear,there were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night,hemingway
13071,13072,the old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true,it was an hour before the first shark hit him,hemingway
13073,13074,the shark was not an accident,he had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea,hemingway
13075,13076,he had come up so fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun,then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had taken,hemingway
13077,13078,sometimes he lost the scent,but he would pick it up again or have just a trace of it and he swam fast and hard on the course,hemingway
13079,13080,he was a very big mako shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws,his back was as blue as a sword fish s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome,hemingway
13081,13082,he was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering,inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards,hemingway
13083,13084,they were not the ordinary pyramidshaped teeth of most sharks,they were shaped like a man s fingers when they are crisped like claws,hemingway
13085,13086,they were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razorsharp cutting edges on both sides,this was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy,hemingway
13087,13088,now he speeded up as he smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water,when the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all and would do exactly what he wished,hemingway
13089,13090,he prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he watched the shark come on,the rope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish,hemingway
13091,13092,the old man s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little hope,it was too good to last he thought,hemingway
13093,13094,he took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in,it might as well have been a dream he thought,hemingway
13095,13096,i can not keep him from hitting me but maybe i can get him,dentuso he thought,hemingway
13097,13098,bad luck to your mother,the shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail,hemingway
13099,13100,the shark s head was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the shark s head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose,there were no such lines,hemingway
13101,13102,there was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking thrusting allswallowing jaws,but that was the location of the brain and the old man hit it,hemingway
13103,13104,he hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength,he hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy,hemingway
13105,13106,the shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once again wrapping himself in two loops of the rope,the old man knew that he was dead but the shark would not accept it,hemingway
13107,13108,then on his back with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking the shark plowed over the water as a speedboat does,the water was white where his tail beat it and threequarters of his body was clear above the water when the rope came taut shivered and then snapped,hemingway
13109,13110,the shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him,then he went down very slowly,hemingway
13111,13112,he took about forty pounds the old man said aloud,he took my harpoon too and all the rope he thought and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others,hemingway
13113,13114,he did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated,when the fish had been hit it was as though he himself were hit,hemingway
13115,13116,but i killed the shark that hit my fish he thought,and he was the biggest dentuso that i have ever seen,hemingway
13117,13118,and god knows that i have seen big ones,it was too good to last he thought,hemingway
13119,13120,i wish it had been a dream now and that i had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers,but man is not made for defeat he said,hemingway
13121,13122,a man can be destroyed but not defeated i am sorry that i killed the fish though he thought,now the bad time is coming and i do not even have the harpoon,hemingway
13123,13124,the dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent,but i was more intelligent than he was,hemingway
13125,13126,perhaps not he thought,perhaps i was only better armed,hemingway
13127,13128,don t think old man he said aloud,because it is all i have left,hemingway
13129,13130,that and baseball,i wonder how the great dimaggio would have liked the way i hit him in the brain,hemingway
13131,13132,it was no great thing he thought,any man could do it,hemingway
13133,13134,but do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the bone spurs,i can not know,hemingway
13135,13136,i never had anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it when i stepped on him when swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain,think about something cheerful old man he said,hemingway
13137,13138,every minute now you are closer to home,but there was nothing to be done now,hemingway
13139,13140,yes there is he said aloud,now he said,hemingway
13141,13142,i am still an old man,he watched only the forward part of the fish and some of his hope returned,hemingway
13143,13144,it is silly not to hope he thought,besides i believe it is a sin,hemingway
13145,13146,do not think about sin he thought,there are enough problems now without sin,hemingway
13147,13148,also i have no understanding of it,i have no understanding of it and i am not sure that i believe in it,hemingway
13149,13150,perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish,i suppose it was even though i did it to keep me alive and feed many people,hemingway
13151,13152,but then everything is a sin,do not think about sin,hemingway
13153,13154,it is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it,let them think about it,hemingway
13155,13156,you were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish,san pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great dimaggio,hemingway
13157,13158,but he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was nothing to read and he did not have a radio he thought much and he kept on thinking about sin,you did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food he thought,hemingway
13159,13160,you killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman,you loved him when he was alive and you loved him after,hemingway
13161,13162,if you love him it is not a sin to kill him,or is it more,hemingway
13163,13164,you think too much old man he said aloud,but you enjoyed killing the dentuso he thought,hemingway
13165,13166,he lives on the live fish as you do,he is not a scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are,hemingway
13167,13168,he is beautiful and noble and knows no fear of anything,i killed him in selfdefense the old man said aloud,hemingway
13169,13170,fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive,the boy keeps me alive he thought,hemingway
13171,13172,i must not deceive myself too much,he leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut him,hemingway
13173,13174,he chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste,it was firm and juicy like meat but it was not red,hemingway
13175,13176,there was no stringiness in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market,but there was no way to keep its scent out of the water and the old man knew that a very bad time was coming,hemingway
13177,13178,the breeze was steady,it had backed a little further into the northeast and he knew that meant that it would not fall off,hemingway
13179,13180,the old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship,there were only the flying fish that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of gulf weed,hemingway
13181,13182,he could not even see a bird,he had sailed for two hours resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit of the meat from the marlin trying to rest and to be strong when he saw the first of the two sharks,hemingway
13183,13184,ay he said aloud,there is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make involuntarily feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood,hemingway
13185,13186,galanos he said aloud,he had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first and had identified them as shovelnosed sharks by the brown triangular fin and the sweeping movements of the tail,hemingway
13187,13188,they had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement,but they were closing all the time,hemingway
13189,13190,the old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller,then he took up the oar with the knife lashed to it,hemingway
13191,13192,he lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain,then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them,hemingway
13193,13194,he closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come,he could see their wide flattened shovelpointed heads now and their whitetipped wide pectoral fins,hemingway
13195,13196,they were hateful sharks bad smelling scavengers as well as killers and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat,it was these sharks that would cut the turtles legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the surface and they would hit a man in the water if they were hungry even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him,hemingway
13197,13198,ay the old man said,galanos,hemingway
13199,13200,but they did not come as the mako had come,one turned and went out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish,hemingway
13201,13202,the other watched the old man with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten,the line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain joined the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the juncture withdrew it and drove it in again into the shark s yellow catlike eyes,hemingway
13203,13204,the shark let go of the fish and slid down swallowing what he had taken as he died,the skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring the shark out from under,hemingway
13205,13206,when he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at him,he hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in,hemingway
13207,13208,the blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too,but the shark came up fast with his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flattopped head as his nose came out of water and lay against the fish,hemingway
13209,13210,the old man withdrew the blade and punched the shark exactly in the same spot again,he still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and the old man stabbed him in his left eye,hemingway
13211,13212,the shark still hung there,no the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain,hemingway
13213,13214,it was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever,the old man reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark s jaws to open them,hemingway
13215,13216,he twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said go on galano,slide down a mile deep,hemingway
13217,13218,then he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course,they must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat he said aloud,hemingway
13219,13220,i wish it were a dream and that i had never hooked him,i m sorry about it fish,hemingway
13221,13222,it makes everything wrong he stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now,drained of blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a mirror and his stripes still showed,hemingway
13223,13224,i shouldn t have gone out so far fish he said,neither for you nor for me,hemingway
13225,13226,look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut,then get your hand in order because there still is more to come,hemingway
13227,13228,i wish i had a stone for the knife the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt,i should have brought a stone you should have brought many things he thought,hemingway
13229,13230,but you did not bring them old man,now is no time to think of what you do not have,hemingway
13231,13232,think of what you can do with what there is,you give me much good counsel he said aloud,hemingway
13233,13234,god knows how much that last one took he said,but she s much lighter now he did not want to think of the mutilated underside of the fish,hemingway
13235,13236,he knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea,he was a fish to keep a man all winter he thought,hemingway
13237,13238,don t think of that,just rest and try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him,hemingway
13239,13240,the blood smell from my hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water,besides they do not bleed much,hemingway
13241,13242,there is nothing cut that means anything,the bleeding may keep the left from cramping,hemingway
13243,13244,what can i think of now,he thought,hemingway
13245,13246,nothing,i must think of nothing and wait for the next ones,hemingway
13247,13248,i wish it had really been a dream he thought,but who knows,hemingway
13249,13250,it might have turned out well,the next shark that came was a single shovelnose,hemingway
13251,13252,he came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it,the old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar down into his brain,hemingway
13253,13254,but the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped,the old man settled himself to steer,hemingway
13255,13256,he did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the water showing first lifesize then small then tiny,that always fascinated the old man,hemingway
13257,13258,but he did not even watch it now,i have the gaff now he said,hemingway
13259,13260,but it will do no good,i am too old to club sharks to death,hemingway
13261,13262,but i will try it as long as i have the oars and the short club and the tiller,he put his hands in the water again to soak them,hemingway
13263,13264,it was getting late in the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky,there was more wind in the sky than there had been and soon he hoped that he would see land,hemingway
13265,13266,you re tired old man he said,the old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in the water,hemingway
13267,13268,they were not even quartering on the scent,they were headed straight for the skiff swimming side by side,hemingway
13269,13270,he jammed the tiller made the sheet fast and reached under the stern for the club,it was an oar handle from a broken oar sawed off to about two and a half feet in length,hemingway
13271,13272,he could only use it effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his right hand flexing his hand on it as he watched the sharks come,they were both galanos,hemingway
13273,13274,i must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head he thought,the two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark s broad head,hemingway
13275,13276,he felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down,but he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish,hemingway
13277,13278,the other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide,the old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws,hemingway
13279,13280,he swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose,the old man swung the club down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness,hemingway
13281,13282,come on galano the old man said,he hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club,hemingway
13283,13284,this time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish,the old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed,hemingway
13285,13286,then he saw one on the surface swimming in circles,he did not see the fin of the other,hemingway
13287,13288,i could not expect to kill them he thought,i could have in my time,hemingway
13289,13290,but i have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good,if i could have used a bat with two hands i could have killed the first one surely,hemingway
13291,13292,even now he thought,he did not want to look at the fish,hemingway
13293,13294,he knew that half of him had been destroyed,the sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks,hemingway
13295,13296,it will be dark soon he said,then i should see the glow of havana,hemingway
13297,13298,i hope no one has been too worried,there is only the boy to worry of course,hemingway
13299,13300,but i am sure he would have confidence,many of the older fishermen will worry,hemingway
13301,13302,many others too he thought,i live in a good town,hemingway
13303,13304,he could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly,then something came into his head,hemingway
13305,13306,half fish he said,fish that you were,hemingway
13307,13308,i am sorry that i went too far out,i ruined us both,hemingway
13309,13310,but we have killed many sharks you and i and ruined many others,how many did you ever kill old fish,hemingway
13311,13312,i should have chopped the bill off to fight them with he thought,but there was no hatchet and then there was no knife,hemingway
13313,13314,but if i had and could have lashed it to an oar butt what a weapon,then we might have fought them together,hemingway
13315,13316,what will you do now if they come in the night,what can you do,hemingway
13317,13318,fight them he said,he put his two hands together and felt the palms,hemingway
13319,13320,they were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them,he leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead,hemingway
13321,13322,his shoulders told him,i have all those prayers i promised if i caught the fish he thought,hemingway
13323,13324,but i am too tired to say them now,i better get the sack and put it over my shoulders,hemingway
13325,13326,he lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky,i have half of him he thought,hemingway
13327,13328,maybe i ll have the luck to bring the forward half in,i should have some luck,hemingway
13329,13330,no he said,you violated your luck when you went too far outside,hemingway
13331,13332,don t be silly he said aloud,and keep awake and steer,hemingway
13333,13334,you may have much luck yet,i d like to buy some if there s any place they sell it he said,hemingway
13335,13336,what could i buy it with,he asked himself,hemingway
13337,13338,could i buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands,you might he said,hemingway
13339,13340,you tried to buy it with eightyfour days at sea,luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her,hemingway
13341,13342,i would take some though in any form and pay what they asked,i wish i could see the glow from the lights he thought,hemingway
13343,13344,i wish too many things,but that is the thing i wish for now,hemingway
13345,13346,he tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead,he saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten o clock at night,hemingway
13347,13348,they were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises,then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze,hemingway
13349,13350,he steered inside of the glow and he thought that now soon he must hit the edge of the stream,now it is over he thought,hemingway
13351,13352,they will probably hit me again,but what can a man do against them in the dark without a weapon,hemingway
13353,13354,he was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the cold of the night,i hope i do not have to fight again he thought,hemingway
13355,13356,i hope so much i do not have to fight again,but by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless,hemingway
13357,13358,they came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish,he clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below,hemingway
13359,13360,he clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it was gone,he jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it holding it in both hands and driving it down again and again,hemingway
13361,13362,but they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the other and together tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more,one came finally against the head itself and he knew that it was over,hemingway
13363,13364,he swung the tiller across the shark s head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish s head which would not tear,he swung it once and twice and again,hemingway
13365,13366,he heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark with the splintered butt,he felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again,hemingway
13367,13368,the shark let go and rolled away,that was the last shark of the pack that came,hemingway
13369,13370,there was nothing more for them to eat,the old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth,hemingway
13371,13372,it was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment,but there was not much of it,hemingway
13373,13374,he spat into the ocean and said eat that galanos,he settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course,hemingway
13375,13376,he sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind,he was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and as intelligently as he could,hemingway
13377,13378,in the night sharks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table,the old man paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to anything except steering,hemingway
13379,13380,he only noticed how lightly and how well the skiff sailed now there was no great weight beside her,she s good he thought,hemingway
13381,13382,she is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller,that is easily replaced,hemingway
13383,13384,he could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies along the shore,he knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home,hemingway
13385,13386,the wind is our friend anyway he thought,then he added sometimes,hemingway
13387,13388,and the great sea with our friends and our enemies,and bed he thought,hemingway
13389,13390,bed is my friend,just bed he thought,hemingway
13391,13392,bed will be a great thing,it is easy when you are beaten he thought,hemingway
13393,13394,i never knew how easy it was,and what beat you he thought,hemingway
13395,13396,nothing he said aloud,the breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now,hemingway
13397,13398,it was quiet in the harbour though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks,there was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could,hemingway
13399,13400,then he stepped out and made her fast to a rock,he unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it,hemingway
13401,13402,then he shouldered the mast and started to climb,it was then he knew the depth of his tiredness,hemingway
13403,13404,he stopped for a moment and looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well behind the skiff s stern,he saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between,hemingway
13405,13406,he started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder,he tried to get up,hemingway
13407,13408,but it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at the road,a cat passed on the far side going about its business and the old man watched it,hemingway
13409,13410,then he just watched the road,finally he put the mast down and stood up,hemingway
13411,13412,he picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder and started up the road,he had to sit down five times before he reached his shack,hemingway
13413,13414,inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall,in the dark he found a water bottle and took a drink,hemingway
13415,13416,then he lay down on the bed,he pulled the blanket over his shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up,hemingway
13417,13418,he was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning,it was blowing so hard that the drifting boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then come to the old man s shack as he had come each morning,hemingway
13419,13420,the boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw the old man s hands and he started to cry,he went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying,hemingway
13421,13422,many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the water his trousers rolled up measuring the skeleton with a length of line,the boy did not go down,hemingway
13423,13424,he had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking after the skiff for him,how is he one of the fishermen shouted,hemingway
13425,13426,sleeping the boy called,he did not care that they saw him crying,hemingway
13427,13428,i believe it the boy said,he went into the terrace and asked for a can of coffee,hemingway
13429,13430,there has never been such a fish,do you want a drink of any kind the proprietor asked,hemingway
13431,13432,no the boy said,tell them not to bother santiago,hemingway
13433,13434,the boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man s shack and sat by him until he woke,once it looked as though he were waking,hemingway
13435,13436,but he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee,finally the old man woke,hemingway
13437,13438,don t sit up the boy said,drink this he poured some of the coffee in a glass,hemingway
13439,13440,the old man took it and drank it,they beat me manolin he said,hemingway
13441,13442,truly,he noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to himself and to the sea,hemingway
13443,13444,i missed you he said,i am not lucky,hemingway
13445,13446,i caught two yesterday,you can make the blade from a spring leaf from an old ford,hemingway
13447,13448,we can grind it in guanabacoa,it should be sharp and not tempered so it will break,hemingway
13449,13450,lie down old man and i will bring you your clean shirt,you must get well fast for there is much that i can learn and you can teach me everything,hemingway
13451,13452,i ll bring the food and the papers the boy said,rest well old man,hemingway
13453,13454,that afternoon there was a party of tourists at the terrace and looking down in the water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour,what s that she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide,hemingway
13455,13456,tiburon the waiter said,eshark he was meaning to explain what had happened,hemingway
13457,13458,up the road in his shack the old man was sleeping again,he was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him,hemingway
13459,13460,the old man was dreaming about the lions,you will meet them doing various things with resolve but their interest rarely holds because after the other thing ordinary life is as flat as the taste of wine when the taste buds have been burned off your tongue,hemingway
13461,13462,wine when your tongue has been burned clean with lye and water feels like puddle water in your mouth while mustard feels like axlegrease and you can smell crisp fried bacon but when you taste it there is only a feeling of crinkly lard,you can learn about this matter of the tongue by coming into the kitchen of a villa on the riviera late at night and taking a drink from what should be a bottle of evian water and which turns out to be eau de javel a concentrated lye product used for cleaning sinks,hemingway
13463,13464,the taste buds on your tongue if burned off by eau de javel will begin to function again after about a week,at what rate other things regenerate one does not know since you lose track of friends and the things one could learn in a week were mostly learned a long time ago,hemingway
13465,13466,the other night i was talking with a good friend to whom all hunting is dull except elephant hunting,to him there is no sport in anything unless there is great danger and if the danger is not enough he will increase it for his own satisfaction,hemingway
13467,13468,a hunting companion of his had told me how this friend was not satisfied with the risks of ordinary elephant hunting but would if possible have the elephants driven or turned so he could take them headon so it was a choice of killing them with the difficult frontal shot as they came trumpeting with their ears spread or having them run over him,this is to elephant hunting what the german cult of suicide climbing is to ordinary mountaineering and i suppose it is in a way an attempt to approximate the old hunting of the armed man who is hunting you,hemingway
13469,13470,this friend was speaking of elephant hunting and urging me to hunt elephant as he said that once you took it up no other hunting would mean anything to you,i was arguing that i enjoyed all hunting and shooting any sort i could get and had no desire to wipe this capacity for enjoyment out with the eau de javel of the old elephant coming straight at you with his trunk up and his ears spread,hemingway
13471,13472,of course you like that big fishing too he said rather sadly,he s an elephant hunter and this last year he s gone fishing for big fish and he s goofy about it,hemingway
13473,13474,there must be something about it but i can t see it,i wish you would he said,hemingway
13475,13476,because you people are sensible on other subjects,once you are out of sight of land and of the other boats you are more alone than you can ever be hunting and the sea is the same as it has been since before men ever went on it in boats,hemingway
13477,13478,in a season fishing you will see it oily flat as the becalmed galleons saw it while they drifted to the westward whitecapped with a fresh breeze as they saw it running with the trades and in high rolling blue hills the tops blowing off them like snow as they were punished by it so that sometimes you will see three great hills of water with your fish jumping from the top of the farthest one and if you tried to make a turn to go with him without picking your chance one of those breaking crests would roar down in on you with a thousand tons of water and you would hunt no more elephants richard my lad,there is no danger from the fish but anyone who goes on the sea the year around in a small power boat does not seek danger,hemingway
13479,13480,you may be absolutely sure that in a year you will have it without seeking so you try always to avoid it all you can,because the gulf stream is an unexploited country only the very fringe of it ever being fished and then only at a dozen places in thousands of miles of current no one knows what fish live in it or how great size they reach or what age or even what kinds of fish and animals live in it at different depths,hemingway
13481,13482,when you are drifting out of sight of land fishing four lines sixty eighty one hundred and one hundred fifty fathoms down in water that is seven hundred fathoms deep you never know what may take the small tuna that you use for bait and every time the line starts to run off the reel slowly first then with a scream of the click as the rod bends and you feel it double and the huge weight of the friction of the line rushing through that depth of water while you pump and reel pump and reel pump and reel trying to get the belly out of the line before the fish jumps there is always a thrill that needs no danger to make it real,it may be a marlin that will jump high and clear off to your right and then go off in a series of leaps throwing a splash like a speedboat in a sea as you shout for the boat to turn with him watching the line melting off the reel before the boat can get around,hemingway
13483,13484,or it may be a broadbill that will show wagging his great broadsword,or it may be some fish that you will never see at all that will head straight out to the northwest like a submerged submarine and never show and at the end of five hours the angler has a straightenedout hook,hemingway
13485,13486,there is always a feeling of excitement when a fish takes hold when you are drifting deep,in hunting you know what you are after and the top you can get is an elephant,hemingway
13487,13488,but who can say what you will hook sometime when drifting in a hundred and fifty fathoms in the gulf stream,there are probably marlin and swordfish to which the fish we have seen caught are pygmies and every time a fish takes the bait drifting you have a feeling perhaps you are hooked to one of these,hemingway
13489,13490,carlos our cuban mate who is fiftythree years old and has been fishing for marlin since he went in the bow of a skiff with his father when he was seven was fishing drifting deep one time when he hooked a white marlin,the fish jumped twice and then sounded and when he sounded suddenly carlos felt a great weight and he could not hold the line which went out and down and down irresistibly until the fish had taken out over a hundred and fifty fathoms,hemingway
13491,13492,carlos says it felt as heavy and solid as though he were hooked to the bottom of the sea,then suddenly the strain was loosened but he could feel the weight of his original fish and pulled it up stone dead,hemingway
13493,13494,some toothless fish like a swordfish or marlin had closed his jaws across the middle of the eightypound white marlin and squeezed it and held it so that every bit of the insides of the fish had been crushed out while the huge fish moved off with the eightypound fish in its mouth,finally it let go,hemingway
13495,13496,what size of a fish would that be,i thought it might be a giant squid but carlos said there were no sucker marks on the fish and that it showed plainly the shape of the marlin s mouth where he had crushed it,hemingway
13497,13498,another time an old man fishing alone in a skiff out of cabañas hooked a great marlin that on the heavy sashcord handline pulled the skiff far out to sea,two days later the old man was picked up by fishermen sixty miles to the eastward the head and forward part of the marlin lashed alongside,hemingway
13499,13500,what was left of the fish less than half weighed eight hundred pounds,the old man had stayed with him a day a night a day and another night while the fish swam deep and pulled the boat,hemingway
13501,13502,when he had come up the old man had pulled the boat up on him and harpooned him,lashed alongside the sharks had hit him and the old man had fought them out alone in the gulf stream in a skiff clubbing them stabbing at them lunging at them with an oar until he was exhausted and the sharks had eaten all that they could hold,hemingway
13503,13504,he was crying in the boat when the fishermen picked him up half crazy from his loss and the sharks were still circling the boat,but what is the excitement in catching them from a launch,hemingway
13505,13506,it comes from the fact that they are strange and wild things of unbelievable speed and power and a beauty in the water and leaping that is indescribable which you would never see if you did not fish for them and to which you are suddenly harnessed so that you feel their speed their force and their savage power as intimately as if you were riding a bucking horse,for half an hour an hour or five hours you are fastened to the fish as much as he is fastened to you and you tame him and break him the way a wild horse is broken and finally lead him to the boat,hemingway
13507,13508,for pride and because the fish is worth plenty of money in the havana market you gaff him at the boat and bring him on board but the having him in the boat isn t the excitement it is while you are fighting him that is the fun,if the fish is hooked in the bony part of the mouth i am sure the hook hurts him no more than the harness hurts the angler,hemingway
13509,13510,a large fish when he is hooked often does not feel the hook at all and will swim toward the boat unconcerned to take another bait,at other times he will swim away deep completely unconscious of the hook and it is when he feels himself held and pressure exerted to turn him that he knows something is wrong and starts to make his fight,hemingway
13511,13512,unless he is hooked where it hurts he makes his fight not against the pain of the hook but against being captured and if when he is out of sight you figure what he is doing in what direction he is pulling when deep down and why you can convince him and bring him to the boat by the same system you break a wild horse,it is not necessary to kill him or even completely exhaust him to bring him to the boat,hemingway
13513,13514,to kill a fish that fights deep you pull against the direction he wants to go until he is worn out and dies,it takes hours and when the fish dies the sharks are liable to get him before the angler can raise him to the top,hemingway
13515,13516,to catch such a fish quickly you figure by trying to hold him absolutely which direction he is working a sounding fish is going in the direction the line slants in the water when you have put enough pressure on the drag so the line would break if you held it any tighter then get ahead of him on that direction and he can be brought to the boat without killing him,you do not tow him or pull him with the motor boat you use the engine to shift your position just as you would walk up or down stream with a salmon,hemingway
13517,13518,a fish is caught most surely from a small boat such as a dory since the angler can shut down on his drag and simply let the fish pull the boat,towing the boat will kill him in time,hemingway
13519,13520,but the most satisfaction is to dominate and convince the fish and bring him intact in everything but spirit to the boat as rapidly as possible,very instructive says the friend,hemingway
13521,13522,marlin carlos yells from the top of the house and stamps his feet up and down the signal that a fish is raised,he swarms down to the wheel and you go back to where the rod rests in its socket and there comes the shadow again fast as the shadow of a plane moving over the water and the spear head fin and shoulders smash out of water and you hear the click the closepin makes as the line pulls out and the long bight of line whishes through the water as the fish turns and as you hold the rod you feel it double and the butt kicks you in the belly as you come back hard and feel his weight as you strike him again and again and again,hemingway
13523,13524,then the heavy rod arcing out toward the fish and the reel in a bandsaw zinging scream the marlin leaps clear and long silver in the sun long round as a hogshead and banded with lavender stripes and when he goes into the water it throws a column of spray like a shell lighting,then he comes out again and the spray roars and again then the line feels slack and out he bursts headed across and in then jumps wildly twice more seeming to hang high and stiff in the air before falling to throw the column of water and you can see the hook in the corner of his jaw,hemingway
13525,13526,then in a series of jumps like a greyhound he heads to the northwest and standing up you follow him in the boat the line taut as a banjo string and little drops coming from it until you finally get the belly of it clear of that friction against the water and have a straight pull out toward the fish,and all the time carlos is shouting oh god the bread of my children,hemingway
13527,13528,oh look at the bread of my children,joseph and mary look at the bread of my children jump,hemingway
13529,13530,there it goes the bread of my children,then he sounded and i said to carlos get me the harness,hemingway
13531,13532,like a filled pocketbook jumping,he can t go down deep now,hemingway
13533,13534,is the harness all right,four hundred and fifty says carlos,hemingway
13535,13536,never says julio,thou and thy never says carlos,hemingway
13537,13538,the fish is nearly whipped now and the dead ache is out of raising him and then while lifting i feel something slip,it holds for an instant and then the line is slack,hemingway
13539,13540,he s gone i say and unbuckle the harness,the bread of your children julio says to carlos,hemingway
13541,13542,yes carlos says,yes,hemingway
13543,13544,joke and no joke yes,el pan de mis hijos,hemingway
13545,13546,three hundred and fifty pounds at ten cents a pound,how many days does a man work for that in the winter,hemingway
13547,13548,how cold is it at three o clock in the morning on all those days,and the fog and the rain in a norther,hemingway
13549,13550,every time he jumps the hook cutting the hole a little bigger in his jaw,ay how he could jump,hemingway
13551,13552,don t talk about that any more said carlos,no it is not elephant hunting,hemingway
13553,13554,but we get a kick out of it,when you have a family and children your family or my family or the family of carlos you do not have to look for danger,hemingway
13555,13556,there is always plenty of danger when you have a family,and after a while the danger of others is the only danger and there is no end to it nor any pleasure in it nor does it help to think about it,hemingway
13557,13558,but there is great pleasure in being on the sea in the unknown wild suddenness of a great fish in his life and death which he lives for you in an hour while your strength is harnessed to his and there is satisfaction in conquering this thing which rules the sea it lives in,then in the morning of the day after you have caught a good fish when the man who carried him to the market in a handcart brings the long roll of heavy silver dollars wrapped in a newspaper on board it is very satisfactory money,hemingway
13559,13560,it really feels like money,there s the bread of your children you say to carlos,hemingway
13561,13562,in the time of the dance of the millions he says a fish like that was worth two hundred dollars,now it is thirty,hemingway
13563,13564,on the other hand a fisherman never starves,look at you,hemingway
13565,13566,and the longer i fish the poorer i ll be,but look,hemingway
13567,13568,that fishing in a dinghy is very interesting,what we need for prosperity is a war carlos says,hemingway
13569,13570,miami herald miami fla and signed by hemingway on the verso e,bill fagen leaving,hemingway
13571,13572,maine tuna club fishing with me on pilar landed blue marlin which weighed lbs,on tested scales after all of meat below anal fin had been torn away by sharks when fish was brought to gaff had him ready to take in when sharks hit him fish feet inches tail inch spread girth in,hemingway
13573,13574,will send all other exact measurements when have chance to use steel tape on him fish hooked off bimini hooked in corner of mouth never layted jumped times clear brought to boat in an hour such a heavy fish jumped hell out of himself,we worked him fast our system,hemingway
13575,13576,had him at boat when shark hit him,fish would have weighed between and he weighed before some witnesses,hemingway
13577,13578,we could have brought him plenty up above that by weighing the loose meat,same day i landed lb,hemingway
13579,13580,white marlin on light outfit and a lb,fish was with minutes more would have had him was reaching for leader when they hit him,hemingway
13581,13582,twopage typewritten list preserved in two drafts the first with handwritten annotations see fig,ernest hemingway personal papers stories and fragments box folder at the john f kennedy presidential library and museum boston,hemingway
13583,13584,vicious,grows to pounds and over,hemingway
13585,13586,could be maneater but ordinarily follows schools of mackerel and swordfish,frequents entrances of harbours and small rivers and along reefs,hemingway
13587,13588,is definitely a maneating shark and reaches weights of and over,rarely attacks during breeding period in april,hemingway
13589,13590,when blood is present in water will attack anything including man,reaches pounds but most common at pounds,hemingway
13591,13592,they have been known to take bathers from the rocky beaches off the punta brava at havana and if they have become man eaters are dangerous,if hungry they will attack anything,hemingway
13593,13594,if not hungry they are shy and wary,they are found in all parts of the gulf stream and will come instantly to the scent of blood,hemingway
13595,13596,have a fine sense of smell will come where any objects dropped in the water especially those containing grease or anything nauseous,the smell of blood maddens them so that they will attack blindly even when wounded,hemingway
13597,13598,have never known them to be maneaters as they are comparatively shy and never attack hooked fish,reach great weight,hemingway
13599,13600,much nonsense has been written about this shark as a maneater,off cuban coast those sharks which have attacked human beings have been the hammerhead galano or tiger shark,hemingway
13601,13602,the mako will rush at a man who has him hooked but he is primarily a fisheating shark and there are no instances of his ever having attacked human beings as far as i know,no instances of ever attacking human beings,hemingway
13603,13604,has no teeth,dark brown in colour,hemingway
13605,13606,absolutely inoffensive,never attacks human beings nor hooked fish,hemingway
13607,13608,plump full bodied extremely voracious,a fish shark which might and has attacked men who have had fish slime or fish blood on them and might attack a man who is bleeding,hemingway
13609,13610,runs usually with the schools of migratory fish such as kingfish bonito etc,their behaviour when there is no blood in the water is completely distinct from when there is blood,hemingway
13611,13612,for a repellant to have any value conditions of wounded men in the water must be simulated either by bleeding porpoise or blackfish bleeding fish or a bleeding warm blooded animal such as a pig,i myself would consider any tests of a repellant valueless unless it were made under such conditions,hemingway
13613,13614,a shark can change from a comparatively harmless object to a definite danger the instant it smells blood,without plenty of fresh blood from a live object in the water any repellant tests will be worthless,hemingway
13615,13616,eh,ernest hemingway collection item manuscript series box folder at the john f kennedy presidential library and museum boston,hemingway
13617,13618,the month started the tenth of april and by the tenth of may we had twenty five marlin and the charter was over,the thing to have done then would have been to buy some presents to take back to key west fill the anita with just a little more than the expensive cuban gas necessary to run across get cleared and go home,hemingway
13619,13620,but the big fish had not started to run,do you want to try her another month cap mr,hemingway
13621,13622,josie asked,he owned the anita and was chartering her for ten dollars a day,hemingway
13623,13624,the standard charter price then was thirty five a day,you got good credit with the standard oil company at belot across the bay and when we get the bill i can pay them from last month s charter money,hemingway
13625,13626,we had forty two marlin by then and still the big ones had not come,there was a dark heavy stream close in to the morro sometimes there would be acres of bait and there were flying fish going out from under the bows and birds working over the water all the time,hemingway
13627,13628,but we had not raised one of the huge marlin although we were catching or loseing white marlin each day and on one day i caught five,we were very popular along the water front because we butchered all our fish and gave them away and when we would come in past the morro castle and up the channel toward the san francisco docks with a marlin flag up you could see the crowd starting to run for the docks,hemingway
13629,13630,the fish was worth from eight to twelve cents a pound that year to a fisherman and twice that in the market,the day we came in with five flags the police had to charge the crowd with clubs,hemingway
13631,13632,it was ugly and bad,but that was an ugly and bad year ashore,hemingway
13633,13634,the goddam police running off our regular clients and getting all the fish mr,josie said,hemingway
13635,13636,to hell with you he told a policeman that was reaching down for a ten pound piece of marlin,i never saw your ugly face before,hemingway
13637,13638,write him down in the compromiso book for next week for a small piece cap mr,josie said,hemingway
13639,13640,now police you go the hell away from here and club somebody that isn t friends of ours,i seen enough damn police in my life,hemingway
13641,13642,go on,you go on up to the ambos mundos and get washed up cap and take a shower and i ll meet you there,hemingway
13643,13644,then we can go up to the floridita and talk things over,i can clean up good on her here after carlos cleans,hemingway
13645,13646,my room was on the north east corner and the trade wind blew through the windows and made it cool,i looked out of the window at the roofs of the old part of town and across at the harbour and watched the orizaba go out slowly down the harbour with all her lights on,hemingway
13647,13648,i was tired from working so many fish and i felt like going to bed,but i knew if i lay down i might go to sleep so i sat on the bed and looked out the window and watched the bats hunting and then finally i undressed and took a shower and got into some fresh clothes and went downstairs,hemingway
13649,13650,mr,josie was waiting in the doorway of the hotel,hemingway
13651,13652,you must be tired ernest he said,no i lied,hemingway
13653,13654,i m tired he said,just from watching you pull on fish,hemingway
13655,13656,that s only two under our all time record,seven and the eye of an eighth neither mr,hemingway
13657,13658,josie nor i liked to think of the eye of the eighth fish but we always stated the record in this way,we were walking up the narrow sidewalk on obispo street and mr,hemingway
13659,13660,josie was looking in all the lighted windows of the shops,he never bought anything until it was time to go home,hemingway
13661,13662,but he liked to look at everything there was for sale,we passed the last two lighted stores and the lottery ticket office and pushed open the swinging door of the old floridita,hemingway
13663,13664,you better sit down cap mr,josie said,hemingway
13665,13666,no,josie,hemingway
13667,13668,german beer,i was waiting for mr,hemingway
13669,13670,josie to bring up the subject,he brought it up as soon as his beer came,hemingway
13671,13672,carlos says they got to come in this next month he said,carlos was our cuban mate and a great commercial marlin fisherman,hemingway
13673,13674,he says he never saw such a current and when they come they ll be something like we never seen,we can run into the cove for lunch and i ll cook in there,hemingway
13675,13676,we re getting those wavy striped bonita all the time,they re as good as little tuna,hemingway
13677,13678,carlos says he can pick us up stuff cheap in the market when he goes for bait,then we can eat supper nights in the perla of san francisco restaurant,hemingway
13679,13680,you can stay with him forever if you eat good,and we re going to eat good,hemingway
13681,13682,but i don t mean none at all,social life on saturday nights only,hemingway
13683,13684,i don t want to interfere with that,why don t you write one about just things that you and i know,hemingway
13685,13686,write one about what the anita s seen,but you got plenty to remember,hemingway
13687,13688,thank you very much mr,josie,hemingway
13689,13690,carlos says the big ones can come any day now,all they got in them is rum and a little lime juice and maraschino,hemingway
13691,13692,they were very nice looking girls and they were fresh for the evening,the fishermen one said in spanish,hemingway
13693,13694,the two big healthy fishermen in from the sea the other girl said,nsl mr,hemingway
13695,13696,josie said to me,no social life i confirmed,hemingway
13697,13698,you have secrets one of the girls asked,she was an awfully nice looking girl and on this profile you could not see the slight imperfection where some early friend s right hand had marred the complete purity of the line of her rather beautiful nose,hemingway
13699,13700,the cap and i are talking business mr,josie said to the two girls and they went down to the far end of the bar,hemingway
13701,13702,you see how easy it is mr,josie asked,hemingway
13703,13704,i ll handle the social end and all you have to do is get up in the mornings early and write and be in shape to fish,big fish,hemingway
13705,13706,josie said seriously,but you re the one of us two that can write,hemingway
13707,13708,and you re younger than me and better suited to handle the fish,josie said,hemingway
13709,13710,it was a slow night and there was no one but us in the place,nsl mr,hemingway
13711,13712,josie said,nsl i repeated ritually,hemingway
13713,13714,constante mr,josie said,hemingway
13715,13716,ernesto here wants a waiter,they re in politics and in a year like this they were impressed and a little frightened,hemingway
13717,13718,in the morning when the first daylight from across the bay woke me i got up and started to write on a story that i hoped mr,josie would like,hemingway
13719,13720,it had the anita in it and the water front and the things we knew that had happened and i tried to get into it the feeling of the sea and the things we saw and smelt and heard and felt each day,i worked on the story every morning and we fished each day and caught good fish,hemingway
13721,13722,i trained hard and fought all the fish standing instead of sitting in a chair,and still the big fish had not come,hemingway
13723,13724,one day we saw one towing a commercial fisherman s dinghy with the dinghy down by the bows and the marlin makeing splashes as a speed boat would each time he jumped,that one broke off,hemingway
13725,13726,one day in a rain squall we saw four men trying to hoist one wide and deep and dark purple into a skiff,that marlin dressed out five hundred pounds and i saw the huge steaks cut from him on the marble slab in the old market,hemingway
13727,13728,then on a sunny day with a heavy dark stream the water so clear and in so close that you could see the shoals in the mouth of the harbour ten fathoms deep we hit our first big fish just outside the morro,in those days there were no outriggers and no rod holders and i was just letting out a light rig hopeing to pick up a kingfish in the channel when this fish hit,hemingway
13729,13730,he came out in a surge and his bill looked like a sawedoff billiard cue,behind it his head showed huge and wide and he looked as wide as a dinghy,hemingway
13731,13732,then he passed us in a rush with the line cutting parallel to the boat and the reel emptying so fast that it was hot to the touch,there were four hundred yards of fifteen thread line on the reel and half of it was gone by the time i had gotten into the bow of the anita,hemingway
13733,13734,i got there by holding onto handholds we had built into the top of the house,we had practiced this run forward and the scramble over the forward deck to where you could brace against the stem of the boat with your feet,hemingway
13735,13736,but we had never practiced it with a fish that passed you like a subway express when you are at a local station and with one arm holding the rod bucking and digging into the butt rest and with the other hand and both bare feet braking on the deck as the fish hauled you forward,hook her up josie i yelled,hemingway
13737,13738,carlos was holding me around the waist and ahead of us the fish was jumping,he looked as big around as a big wine barrel when he jumped,hemingway
13739,13740,he was silver in the bright sun and i could see the broad purple stripes down his sides,each time he jumped he made a splash like a horse falling off a cliff and he jumped and jumped and jumped,hemingway
13741,13742,the reel was too hot to hold and the core of line on it was getting thinner and thinner in spite of the anita going full speed after the fish,can you get any more out of her i called to mr,hemingway
13743,13744,josie,not in this world he said,hemingway
13745,13746,he s the biggest marlin i ve ever seen,if he ll only stop,hemingway
13747,13748,if he ll only go down,that is about the way we went,hemingway
13749,13750,then with less than twenty yards of line on the reel he stopped and we ran up on him recovering line all the time,i remember that there was a grace line ship ahead of us with the black pilot boat going out to her and i was worried that we might be on her course as she came in,hemingway
13751,13752,then i remember watching her while i reeled and then working my way back to the stern and watching the ship pick up her speed,she was coming in well outside of us and the pilot boat would not foul us either,hemingway
13753,13754,now i was in the chair and the fish was straight up and down and we had a third of the line on the reel,carlos had poured sea water on the reel to cool it and he poured a bucket of water over my head and shoulders,hemingway
13755,13756,how are you doing cap mr,josie asked,hemingway
13757,13758,grande carlos kept saying,he was trembling like a bird dog a good bird dog,hemingway
13759,13760,i ve never seen such a fish,never,hemingway
13761,13762,never,the current was very strong and it had carried us down to opposite cojimar which is about six miles from where the fish first sounded,hemingway
13763,13764,i was tired but my hands and feet were in good shape and i was getting line on him now quite steadily being careful never to pull harshly nor to jerk,i could move him now,hemingway
13765,13766,it wasn t easy,but it was possible if you kept the line just this side of the breaking point,hemingway
13767,13768,he s going to come up carlos said,he s puzzled carlos said,hemingway
13769,13770,and you re leading him,he ll weigh dressed out carlos said,hemingway
13771,13772,keep your mouth off of him mr,josie said,hemingway
13773,13774,you can not say it was frightening,but it was awesome,hemingway
13775,13776,we saw him slow and quiet and almost unmoveing in the water with his great pectoral fins like two long purple scythe blades,then he saw the boat and the line started to race off the reel as though we were hooked to a motor car and he started jumping out to the northwest with the water pouring from him at each jump,hemingway
13777,13778,i had to go into the bow again and we chased him until he sounded,this time he went down almost opposite the morro,hemingway
13779,13780,then i worked my way back to the stern again,do you want a drink cap mr,hemingway
13781,13782,josie asked,no i said,hemingway
13783,13784,when i got back to the stern and could sit down again mr,but now when i lifted it did not straighten as it should,hemingway
13785,13786,she s still got some left mr,josie said,hemingway
13787,13788,you can stick with him forever cap,i m worried about the rod,hemingway
13789,13790,he s tired carlos said,he s going to come in easy now,hemingway
13791,13792,the rod s tip now touched the surface of the water and when you lifted to raise the fish and to reel to take up line the rod did not react,it was not a rod anymore,hemingway
13793,13794,it was like a projection of the line,it was still possible to gain a few inches of line each time you lifted,hemingway
13795,13796,but that was all,the fish was moveing in slow circles and as he moved on the outgoing half of the circle he took line off of the reel,hemingway
13797,13798,on the incoming circle you gained it back,but with the temper gone out of the rod you could not punish him and you had no command over him at all,hemingway
13799,13800,it s bad cap i said to mr,josie,hemingway
13801,13802,he says he caught so much air jumping he can t go deep and die,he says this is the way the big ones always act at the end when they ve jumped a lot,hemingway
13803,13804,josie make and i was impressed,just then the big fish started down and down and down,hemingway
13805,13806,i was braking with both hands on the drum of the reel and keeping the line almost at breaking point and feeling the metal of the reel drum revolve in slow jerks under my fingers,how s the time i asked mr,hemingway
13807,13808,josie,hemingway he has to come up,hemingway
13809,13810,get him some water carlos mr,josie said,hemingway
13811,13812,the sweat salted the places on my shoulders where the harness had rubbed them bare but it was so hot in the sun that there was no warm feeling from the blood,it was a july day and the sun was at noon,hemingway
13813,13814,put some more salt water on his head mr,josie said,hemingway
13815,13816,he hung steady for a time feeling as solid as though you were hooked to a concrete pier and then slowly he started up,i recovered the line reeling with the wrist alone as there was no spring in the rod at all and it was limp as a weeping willow,hemingway
13817,13818,when the fish was about a fathom under the surface so that we could see him looking like a long purple striped canoe with two great jutting wings he started to circle slowly,i held all the tension i could on him to try and shorten the circle,hemingway
13819,13820,i was holding up to that absolute hardness that indicates the breaking strength of the line when the rod let go,it did not break sharply or suddenly,hemingway
13821,13822,it just collapsed,cut thirty fathoms of line off the big rig i said to carlos,hemingway
13823,13824,but he was a whipped fish now and on the heavy gear we should get him,the only problem was that the big rod was too stiff for the fifteen thread line,hemingway
13825,13826,that was my problem and i would have to work it out,carlos was stripping white thirty six thread line off the big hardy reel measureing it with his arms extended as he pulled it out through the guides of the rod and dropped it on the deck,hemingway
13827,13828,i held the fish all that i could with the useless rod and saw carlos cut the white line and pull a long length of it through the guides,all right cap i said to mr,hemingway
13829,13830,josie,you take this line now when he comes in on his circle and take in enough so carlos can make the two lines fast,hemingway
13831,13832,josie brought the line in foot by foot and passed it to carlos who was knotting it to the white line,he s got them tied mr,hemingway
13833,13834,josie said,he still had about a yard of the green fifteen thread line to spare and was holding the live line in his fingers as the fish came to the inside limit of his circle,hemingway
13835,13836,i broke my hands loose from the small rod laid it down and took the big rod that carlos handed me,cut away when you are ready i said to carlos,hemingway
13837,13838,to mr,then i heard a cry such as i have never heard a sane human being make,hemingway
13839,13840,it was as though you could distill all of despair and make it into a sound,then i saw the green line slowly going through mr,hemingway
13841,13842,josie s fingers and then watched it go on down down and out of sight,carlos had cut the wrong loop of the knots he had made,hemingway
13843,13844,the fish was out of sight,cap mr,hemingway
13845,13846,josie said,he did not look very well,hemingway
13847,13848,then he looked at his watch,four hours and twenty two minutes he said,hemingway
13849,13850,i went down to see carlos,he had been vomiting in the head and i told him not to feel bad that it could happen to anyone,hemingway
13851,13852,his brown face was all tied up and he was talking in a low strange voice so you could hardly hear him,all my life fishing and i never saw such a fish and i did that,hemingway
13853,13854,you mustn t talk nonsense like that,we ll catch plenty of bigger fish but we never did,hemingway
13855,13856,mr,josie and i sat in the stern and let the anita drift,hemingway
13857,13858,it was a lovely day on the gulf with only a light breeze and we looked at the shore line with the small mountains showing behind it,mr,hemingway
13859,13860,josie was putting mercurochrome on my shoulders and on my hands where they had stuck to the rod and on the soles of my bare feet where the skin was chafed through,then he mixed two whisky sours,hemingway
13861,13862,how s carlos i asked,he s pretty broke up,hemingway
13863,13864,it s all i ever want to do mr,josie said,hemingway
13865,13866,on that day we did not put out any light rig when we hit the clear water,we had done that once too often,hemingway
13867,13868,i slacked out a big cero mackerel that weighed about four pounds from the one really big outfit we had,it was the heavy hardy rod and the reel with the white thirty six thread line and it was a good big outfit for those days,hemingway
13869,13870,carlos had spliced back on the twenty fathoms of line he had taken off the day before and the five inch reel was full,the only trouble was the rod was too stiff,hemingway
13871,13872,in big game fishing a rod that is too stiff kills the angler while a rod that bends properly kills the fish,carlos only spoke when spoken to and he was still in his sorrow,hemingway
13873,13874,i could not afford any sorrow because i ached too much and mr,josie was never much of a man for sorrow,hemingway
13875,13876,all he s been doing all morning is shakeing his goddamn head he said,we called each other cap interchangeably,hemingway
13877,13878,i feel good mr,josie said,hemingway
13879,13880,i went up town last night and sat and listened to that all girl orchestra on the square and drank a few bottles of beer and then i went to donovan s,bad,hemingway
13881,13882,carlos had turned the anita to follow the edge of the stream along past the fortress of cabanas,the white cylinder of the teaser was jumping and darting in the wake and mr,hemingway
13883,13884,josie had settled in his chair and was slacking out another big mackerel bait on his side of the stern,in donovan s there was a man claimed he was a captain in the secret police,hemingway
13885,13886,he said he liked my face and he said he d kill any man in the place for me as a present,i tried to quiet him down,hemingway
13887,13888,but he said he liked me and he wanted to kill somebody to prove it,he was one of those special machado police,hemingway
13889,13890,i tried to tell him about the fish so as to take his mind off of it,but he said shit on your fish,hemingway
13891,13892,you never had any fish,see so i said okay shit on the fish,hemingway
13893,13894,i m going to kill somebody for you for a present and shit on the fish,there wasn t any fish,hemingway
13895,13896,like hell you re going home he said,you re my friend and you re going to stay here so i said good night to him and i said to donovan donovan i m sorry your money s on the floor i didn t know what this police would try to do and i didn t care,hemingway
13897,13898,i was going home,so as soon as i start for home this police hauls out his gun and starts to pistol whip a poor damn gallego that was in there drinking a beer that never d opened his mouth all night,hemingway
13899,13900,nobody did anything to the police,i didn t either,hemingway
13901,13902,i know it,because it can t,hemingway
13903,13904,but what i didn t like the most was that police saying he liked my face,josie s face very much too,hemingway
13905,13906,i liked it more than almost anybody s face i know,it had taken me a long time to appreciate it because it was a face that had not been sculptured for a quick or facile success,hemingway
13907,13908,it had been formed at sea on the profitable side of bars playing cards with other gamblers and by enterprises of great risk conceived and undertaken with cold and exact intelligence,no part of the face was handsome except the eyes which were a lighter and stranger blue than the mediterranean is on its brightest and clearest day,hemingway
13909,13910,the eyes were wonderful and the face was certainly not beautiful and now it looked like blistered leather,you have a good face cap i said,hemingway
13911,13912,josie said,sitting there on the square with the all girl orchestra and that girl that sings it was fine and wonderful,hemingway
13913,13914,it didn t hurt you in the gut,josie said,hemingway
13915,13916,it won t chafe as bad,josie said,hemingway
13917,13918,and work probably kills more people than any other habit,there was a little smoke comeing up from the kiln and i could see the dust of a truck comeing along the rock road on the shore,hemingway
13919,13920,some birds were working over a patch of bait inshore,then i heard carlos shout marlin,hemingway
13921,13922,he was very dark in the water and as i watched his bill came out of the water behind the big mackerel,it was an ugly bill round and thick and short and the fish behind it bulked hugely under the surface,hemingway
13923,13924,let him have it carlos yelled,he s got it in his mouth mr,hemingway
13925,13926,josie was reeling his bait in and i was waiting for the tension that would mean that the marlin had really taken the mackerel,the typescript is item of the ernest hemingway collection at the john f kennedy presidential library and museum in boston,hemingway
13927,13928,the handwritten additions are italicized below,the page numbers refer to the typescript,hemingway
13929,13930,page in the first forty days a boy had been with him,but after forty days without a fish the boy s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao which is the worst form of unlucky and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week,hemingway
13931,13932,see fig,page that s easy,hemingway
13933,13934,i can always borrow two dollars and a half i think perhaps i can too,but i try not to borrow,hemingway
13935,13936,page the tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and then they were jumping in all directions churning the water and leaping in all directions,long jumps after the bait,hemingway
13937,13938,they were circling it and driving it,page i picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding,hemingway
13939,13940,page this far out out here he must be huge in this month he thought,page now he was ready,hemingway
13941,13942,he had three forty fathom coils of line in reserve beside in now as well as the coil he was using,page he must have his mouth shut tight on the wire,hemingway
13943,13944,i wish i could see him,i wish i could see him only once to know what i have against me,hemingway
13945,13946,page i can do nothing with him and he can do nothing to with me he thought,not as long as he keeps this up,hemingway
13947,13948,page i wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today he thought,it would be wonderful to do this with a radio,hemingway
13949,13950,then he thought think of it always,in the final publication is added here think of what you are doing you must do nothing stupid,hemingway
13951,13952,page remember no matter how little you want to that you must eat him in the morning,remember he said to himself,hemingway
13953,13954,page when the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her holding the bill rapier bill with its sand paper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors and then with the boy s aid hoisted her aboard the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat,then while he was the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep his lavender wings that were his pectoral fins spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing,hemingway
13955,13956,he was beautiful the old man remembered and he had stayed,page my choice was to go there to find him beyond all people,hemingway
13957,13958,beyond all people in the world,now we are joined together and have been since noon,hemingway
13959,13960,page but you haven t got the boy he thought,you have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now in the dark or not in the dark and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils,hemingway
13961,13962,page there was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased,it was the yellow gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night,hemingway
13963,13964,fish he said,i love you and respect you very much,hemingway
13965,13966,page the clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water then blurring then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea,page if there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead if you are at sea,hemingway
13967,13968,they do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for he thought,the land must make a difference too in the shape of the clouds,hemingway
13969,13970,but we have no hurricane coming now,page blood came out from under the finger nails of both their his and the negro s hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the betters bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched,hemingway
13971,13972,the walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them,the negro s shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps,hemingway
13973,13974,page now go back and eat prepare the dolphin,it is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep,hemingway
13975,13976,page the dolphin was cold and a leperous grey white now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fishes head,page he lay forward cramping himself against the line with all of his body putting all his weight onto his right hand and he was asleep,hemingway
13977,13978,page then the line came in no longer would not come in any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun,then it started out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgeingly back into the dark water,hemingway
13979,13980,he is makeing the far part of his circle now he said,i must hold all i can he thought,hemingway
13981,13982,the strain will shorten his circle each time,perhaps in an hour i will see him,hemingway
13983,13984,now i must convince him and then i must kill him,page just then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands,hemingway
13985,13986,it was sharp and hard feeling and heavy,he is hitting the wire leader with his spear he thought,hemingway
13987,13988,that was bound to come,he had to do that,hemingway
13989,13990,it may make him jump though and i would rather he stayed circling now,a few the jumps are were necessary for him to take air,hemingway
13991,13992,but after that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook,page i m tireder than i have ever been he thought and now the trade wind is riseing,hemingway
13993,13994,but that will be good to take him in with,i need that badly,hemingway
13995,13996,page but it was a fair weather breeze and he would need had to have it to get home,page he felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could,hemingway
13997,13998,i moved him he thought,maybe this time i can get him over,hemingway
13999,14000,pull hands he thought,hold up legs,hemingway
14001,14002,last for me head,last for me,hemingway
14003,14004,you never went,this time i ll pull him over,hemingway
14005,14006,page you are killing me fish the old man thought,but you have a right to,hemingway
14007,14008,never have i seen a greater or more beautiful nor calmer or more noble thing than you brother,come on and kill me,hemingway
14009,14010,i do not care who kills who,page he took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it against the fishes agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat long deep wide silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water,hemingway
14011,14012,page then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff,the old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well,hemingway
14013,14014,page besides he thought,everything kills everything else in some way,hemingway
14015,14016,fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive,the boy keeps me alive he thought,hemingway
14017,14018,i must not deceive myself too much,page then he took up the oar with the knife lashed to it,hemingway
14019,14020,he lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain,then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them,hemingway
14021,14022,he closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and so they would not flinch and watched the sharks come,he could see their wide flattened shovelpointed heads now and their white tipped wide pectoral fins,hemingway
14023,14024,they were nasty hateful sharks bad smelling scavengers as well as killers and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat,page when he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at him,hemingway
14025,14026,he hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in,the blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too,hemingway
14027,14028,page no the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain,it was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever,hemingway
14029,14030,page the old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar,then he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course,hemingway
14031,14032,page the old man settled himself to steer,he did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the water showing first life size then small then tiny,hemingway
14033,14034,that always fascinated the old man,but he did not even watch it now,hemingway
14035,14036,see fig,page the two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark s broad head,hemingway
14037,14038,pages he jerked the tiller from the rudder and beat and chopped with it holding it in both hands and driveing it down against all evil and again,but they were up to the bow now and driveing in again and again and one after the other and together tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned to come again once more,hemingway
14039,14040,until the carcass was clean,page he felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again,hemingway
14041,14042,the shark let go and rolled away,that was the last shark of the pack that came,hemingway
14043,14044,there was nothing more for them to eat,the old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth,hemingway
14045,14046,it was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment,but there was not much of it,hemingway
14047,14048,he spat into the ocean and said eat that galanos,page the wind is our friend anyway he thought,hemingway
14049,14050,then he added sometimes,and the great sea with our friends and our enemies,hemingway
14051,14052,and bed he thought,bed is my friend,hemingway
14053,14054,why did i never love bed when i had her,you did he thought,hemingway
14055,14056,but then you loved too many beds,but beds were all the same and the sea is a greater whore than all,hemingway
14057,14058,just bed he thought,page what s that she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide,hemingway
14059,14060,no writer who knows the great writers who did not receive the prize can accept it other than with humility,there is no need to list these writers,hemingway
14061,14062,everyone here may make his own list according to his knowledge and his conscience,it would be impossible for me to ask the ambassador of my country to read a speech in which a writer said all of the things which are in his heart,hemingway
14063,14064,things may not be immediately discernable in what a man writes and in this sometimes he is fortunate but eventually they are quite clear and by these and the degree of alchemy ability to make magic that he possesses he will endure or be forgotten,writing at its best is a lonely life,hemingway
14065,14066,organizations for writers palliate the writer s loneliness but i doubt if they improve his writing,he grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates,hemingway
14067,14068,for he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity or the lack of it each day,for a true writer each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment,hemingway
14069,14070,he should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed,then sometimes with great luck he will succeed,hemingway
14071,14072,how simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written,it is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go out to where no one can help him,hemingway
14073,14074,i have spoken too long for a writer,a writer should write what he has to say and not speak it,hemingway

15355,15356,i am going to keep away out of it he thought,pablo thought of that of course,hemingway
15357,15358,agustín he said,i wish to speak to thee robert jordan said,hemingway
15359,15360,he moved reluctantly and contemptuously,milk agustín said,hemingway

15369,15370,yes he said,i do not fear that,hemingway
15371,15372,trust me or not pablo said,the woman nodded,hemingway
15373,15374,then nodded again,then pablo fernando said judicially,hemingway
15375,15376,in truth primitivo asked,de veras pablo told him,hemingway
15377,15378,maybe agustín said,but this is another wheel,hemingway
15379,15380,it has been around twice now,i think that is all he said to himself,hemingway
15381,15382,there will be pablo or there will be no pablo,he shut the notebook and looked up at maria,hemingway
15383,15384,hola guapa he said to her,his eyes were bleary again,hemingway
15385,15386,robert jordan looked at him closely,don t step on that wheel,hemingway
15387,15388,i think it is going to start to swing again,how is it asked pablo,hemingway
15389,15390,very good robert jordan said,keep off the wheel he told himself,hemingway
15391,15392,sure,how does it go robert jordan asked politely,hemingway
15393,15394,yes pablo said,perhaps pablo said,hemingway
15395,15396,w ho knows,it must be revolving by itself,hemingway
15397,15398,they will not get me onto it again,yes when this is over,hemingway
15399,15400,could you take maria to gaylord s,no,hemingway
15401,15402,maybe you wouldn t go to gaylord s at all,after this was over,hemingway
15403,15404,they were peasants and workers,the comintern had educated them there,hemingway
15405,15406,he had learned that,there was a lot of lying though,hemingway
15407,15408,he hated it,that was all right too,hemingway
15409,15410,w hy shouldn t he be,there was always lying in a war,hemingway
15411,15412,all right,they would have three days in madrid,hemingway
15413,15414,three days could be a long time,no that was not the long way,hemingway
15415,15416,he had liked karkov but not the place,kashkin had only been tolerated there,hemingway
15417,15418,karkov had good taste in women,golz would make fun of him too about maria,hemingway
15419,15420,after what he d said to him about no girls,pablo nodded,hemingway
15421,15422,there were lots of them he thought,do you suppose grant really was a drunk,hemingway
15423,15424,his grandfather always claimed he was,no,hemingway
15425,15426,nor any jeb stuart either,nor any sheridan,hemingway
15427,15428,not a one,nor anything resembling one,hemingway
15429,15430,or whether they will strengthen,gaylord s is the place he thought,hemingway
15431,15432,you could fight,so you fought he thought,hemingway
15433,15434,the fighting in the sierras had been that way,taking the valuables was only realistic,hemingway
15435,15436,their running was a selfishness,you were too naïve,hemingway
15437,15438,it was not that way at all,karkov had told him about those days,hemingway
15439,15440,robert jordan did not believe that one,it is very beautiful,hemingway
15441,15442,it didn t really say that robert jordan doubted,it is in the communiqué,hemingway
15443,15444,so that was the way it was at gaylord s now,would it not be the same in anything,hemingway
15445,15446,but look at karkov,he never tired of considering the case of karkov,hemingway
15447,15448,it was there all right,it was an old armored car,hemingway
15449,15450,i have no orders to go there he said sullenly,here are your orders he had told him,hemingway
15451,15452,come on let s go,w here is he,hemingway
15453,15454,down there,the bull ring,hemingway
15455,15456,here is the tank,he left madrid the next day,hemingway
15457,15458,toledo was where he was the bravest i believe,that was the silliest part of the war,hemingway
15459,15460,now with my face i could do nothing,it is the face of a conspirator,hemingway
15461,15462,listen comrade jordan,he is an impressive sight,hemingway
15463,15464,more snow falls from his fur hat,that is the winter fool,hemingway
15465,15466,his face karkov said,much gold,hemingway
15467,15468,you are a friend,all right,hemingway
15469,15470,i mean eventually,perhaps i will write it,hemingway
15471,15472,these are destroyed,good,hemingway
15473,15474,good,i agree with you,hemingway
15475,15476,but it is very rotten,they are magnificent,hemingway
15477,15478,you will see that,you will see,hemingway
15479,15480,was never serious,not much,hemingway
15481,15482,the poum,it is like the name,hemingway
15483,15484,not serious,they should have called it the mumps,hemingway
15485,15486,but no,it can affect both sight and hearing,hemingway
15487,15488,poor poum,they never did kill anybody,hemingway
15489,15490,nin was their only man,we say he is in paris,hemingway
15491,15492,i hope we are not,the book had not been a success,hemingway
15493,15494,but karkov said it was a good book,it is why i bother with you he said,hemingway
15495,15496,nothing he said,the bridge is terminated,hemingway
15497,15498,at his request,he was a very rare man primitivo said,hemingway
15499,15500,very bad,he had fought later in the north,hemingway
15501,15502,like all the world andrés said,no one can tell me that he saw anything,hemingway
15503,15504,it is not that thou art stupid,one who is deaf can not hear music,hemingway
15505,15506,neither can he hear the radio,qué va inglés,hemingway
15507,15508,listen,nada blanquet said,hemingway

15515,15516,plenty,just before the bullfight started,hemingway
15517,15518,he was not killed in that,all of that is true,hemingway

15531,15532,very good primitivo approved,it is clear he said,hemingway
15533,15534,the storm is over,w hat do you do outside pilar had asked,hemingway
15535,15536,good night to every one he had said,pablo was asleep in his chair,hemingway

15539,15540,i am accustomed to it,yes fernando agreed,hemingway

15545,15546,it is a waste of time,oh maria,hemingway
15547,15548,a little wind was rising,he felt it on his face,hemingway
15549,15550,suddenly he felt a panic that she might not come,come now maria,hemingway
15551,15552,oh come here now,do not wait,hemingway
15553,15554,put it with thy pillow she said,avoid the feet she said,hemingway

16835,16836,and what s that agustín asked,shake out of that he said to himself,hemingway
16837,16838,there is much much much to be done today,but he knew it was not that,hemingway
16839,16840,his own submachine gun lay by his left hand,you see anything up above,hemingway
16841,16842,on the rocks above,robert jordan asked,hemingway
16843,16844,i can not hurt him,cabrón agustín said,hemingway
16845,16846,look i nglés,then a bridge was blown,hemingway

16851,16852,pilar jordan shouted across the hill,all dead pablo said,hemingway
16853,16854,agustín turned his head and looked at him,good robert jordan said,hemingway
16855,16856,and thou pablo asked,robert jordan jerked his head,hemingway
16857,16858,i could not leave with that there pablo said,we were barricaded at the lower bend of the post,hemingway
16859,16860,did you shoot them all agustín asked,she asked,hemingway
16861,16862,it is nt faked or phony,it s a true boy s haircut and not from any beauty shop,hemingway
16863,16864,who cut it,the coiffeur at aigues mortes,hemingway
16865,16866,the one who cut your hair a week ago,you told him how you wanted yours cut then and i told him to cut mine just the same as yours,hemingway
16867,16868,he was very nice and was nt at all surprised,he was nt worried at all,hemingway
16869,16870,he said exactly like yours,and i said exactly,hemingway
16871,16872,does nt it do anything to you david,yes he said,hemingway
16873,16874,stupid people will think it is strange,but we must be proud,hemingway
16875,16876,i love to be proud,so do i he said,hemingway
16877,16878,we ll start being proud now,they sat there in the cafe and watched the reflection of the setting sun over the water and watched the dusk come to the town and they drank the fine leau,hemingway
16879,16880,people came by the cafe without being rude to see the girl because they had been the only foreigners in the village and had been there now nearly three weeks and she was a great beauty and they liked her,then there had been the big fish today and ordinarily there would have been much talk about that but this other was a big thing in the village too,hemingway
16881,16882,no decent girls had ever had their hair cut short like that in this part of the country and even in paris it was rare and strange and could be beautiful or could be very bad,it could mean too much or it could only mean showing the beautiful shape of a head that could never be shown as well,hemingway
16883,16884,they ate a steak for dinner rare with mashed potatoes and flageolets and a salad and the girl asked if they might drink tavel,it is a great wine for people that are in love she said,hemingway
16885,16886,she had always looked he thought exactly her age which was now twentyone,he had been very proud of her for that,hemingway
16887,16888,but tonight she did not look it,the lines of her cheekbones showed clear as he had never seen them before and she smiled and her face was heartbreaking,hemingway
16889,16890,in the room it was dark with only a little light from outside,it was cool now with the breeze and the top sheet was gone from the bed,hemingway
16891,16892,dave you do nt mind if we ve gone to the devil do you,no girl he said,hemingway
16893,16894,do nt call me girl,where i m holding you you are a girl he said,hemingway
16895,16896,he held her tight around her breasts and he opened and closed his fingers feeling her and the hard erect freshness between his fingers,they re just my dowry she said,hemingway
16897,16898,the new is my surprise,feel,hemingway
16899,16900,no leave them,they ll be there,hemingway
16901,16902,feel my cheeks and the back of my neck,oh it feels so wonderful and good and clean and new,hemingway
16903,16904,please love me david the way i am,please understand and love me,hemingway
16905,16906,he had shut his eyes and he could feel the long light weight of her on him and her breasts pressing against him and her lips on his,he lay there and felt something and then her hand holding him and searching lower and he helped with his hands and then lay back in the dark and did not think at all and only felt the weight and the strangeness inside and she said now you ca nt tell who is who can you,hemingway
16907,16908,you are changing she said,oh you are,hemingway
16909,16910,you are,yes you are and you re my girl catherine,hemingway
16911,16912,will you change and be my girl and let me take you,you re catherine,hemingway
16913,16914,no,i m peter,hemingway
16915,16916,you re my wonderful catherine,you re my beautiful lovely catherine,hemingway
16917,16918,you were so good to change,oh thank you catherine so much,hemingway
16919,16920,please understand,please know and understand,hemingway
16921,16922,i m going to make love to you forever,at the end they were both dead and empty but it was not over,hemingway
16923,16924,they lay side by side in the dark with their legs touching and her head was on his arm,the moon had risen and there was a little more light in the room,hemingway
16925,16926,she ran her hand exploringly down over his belly without looking and said you do nt think i m wicked,of course not,hemingway
16927,16928,but how long have you thought about that,not all the time,hemingway
16929,16930,but quite a lot,you were so wonderful to let it happen,hemingway
16931,16932,the young man put his arms around the girl and held her very tight to him and felt her lovely breasts against his chest and kissed her on her dear mouth,he held her close and hard and inside himself he said goodbye and then goodbye and goodbye,hemingway
16933,16934,let s lie very still and quiet and hold each other and not think at all he said and his heart said goodbye catherine good bye my lovely girl goodbye and good luck and goodbye,he looked at the girl on her back on the sloping beach her eyes closed her arms against her sides and behind her the slanted square of canvas and the first tufts of beach grass,hemingway
16935,16936,she ought not to stay too long in that position with the sun straight up and down on her he thought,then he walked out and dove flat into the clear cold water and turned on his back and swam backstroke out to sea watching the beach beyond the steady beat of his legs and feet,hemingway
16937,16938,he turned in the water and swam down to the bottom and touched the coarse sand and felt the heavy ridges of it and then came up to the surface and swam steadily in seeing how slow he could keep the beat of his crawl,he walked up to the girl and saw that she was asleep,hemingway
16939,16940,he found his wristwatch in the rucksack to check the time when he should wake her,there was a cold bottle of white wine wrapped in a newspaper and with their towels around it,hemingway
16941,16942,he uncorked it without removing the paper or the towels and took a cool draught from the awkward bundle,then he sat down to watch the girl and to look out to sea,hemingway
16943,16944,this sea was always colder than it looked he thought,it did not really warm until the middle of summer except on the shallow beaches,hemingway
16945,16946,this beach dropped off quite suddenly and the water had been sharply cold until the swimming warmed him,he looked out at the sea and the high clouds and noticed how far the fishing fleet was working to the westward,hemingway
16947,16948,then he looked at the girl sleeping on the sand that was quite dry now and beginning to blow delicately with the rising wind when his feet stirred,during the night he had felt her hands touching him,hemingway
16949,16950,and when he woke it was in the moonlight and she had made the dark magic of the change again and he did not say no when she spoke to him and asked the questions and he felt the change so that it hurt him all through and when it was finished after they were both exhausted she was shaking and she whispered to him now we have done it,now we really have done it,hemingway
16951,16952,yes he thought,now we have really done it,hemingway
16953,16954,and when she went to sleep suddenly like a tired young girl and lay beside him lovely in the moonlight that showed the beautiful new strange line of her head as she slept on her side he leaned over and said to her but not aloud i m with you,no matter what else you have in your head i m with you and i love you,hemingway
16955,16956,in the morning he had been very hungry for breakfast but he waited for her to wake,he kissed her finally and she woke and smiled and got up sleepily and washed in the big basin and slouched in front of the mirror of the armoire and brushed her hair and looked at the mirror unsmiling and then smiled and touched her cheeks with the tips of her fingers and pulled a striped shirt over her head and then kissed him,hemingway
16957,16958,she stood straight so her breasts pushed against his chest and she said do nt worry david,i m your good girl come back again,hemingway
16959,16960,but he was very worried now and he thought what will become of us if things have gone this wildly and this dangerously and this fast,what can there be that will not burn out in a fire that rages like that,hemingway
16961,16962,we were happy and i am sure she was happy,but whoever knows,hemingway
16963,16964,and who are you to judge and who participated and who accepted the change and lived it,if that is what she wants who are you not to wish her to have it,hemingway
16965,16966,you re lucky to have a wife like her and a sin is what you feel bad after and you do nt feel bad,not with the wine you do nt feel bad he told himself and what will you drink when the wine wo nt cover for you,hemingway
16967,16968,he took the bottle of oil out of the rucksack and put a little oil on the girl s chin and on her cheeks and on her nose and found a blue faded patterned handkerchief in the canvas pocket of the rucksack and laid it across her breast,must i stop,hemingway
16969,16970,the girl asked,i m having the most wonderful dream,hemingway
16971,16972,finish the dream he said,thank you,hemingway
16973,16974,in a few minutes she breathed very deeply and shook her head and sat up,let s go in now she said,hemingway
16975,16976,they went in together and swam out and then played under water like porpoises,when they swam in they dried each other off with towels and he handed her the bottle of wine that was still cool in the rolled newspaper and they each took a drink and she looked at him and laughed,hemingway
16977,16978,it s nice to drink it for thirst she said,you do nt really mind being brothers do you,hemingway
16979,16980,no,he touched her forehead and her nose and then her cheeks and chin with the oil and then put it carefully above and behind her ears,hemingway
16981,16982,i want to get behind my ears and neck tanned and over my cheekbones,all the new places,hemingway
16983,16984,you re awfully dark brother he said,you do nt know how dark,hemingway
16985,16986,i like it the girl said,but i want to be darker,hemingway
16987,16988,they lay on the beach on the firm sand that was dry now but still cool after the high tide had fallen,the young man put some oil on the palm of his hand and spread it lightly with his fingers over the girl s thighs and they glowed warm as the skin took the oil,hemingway
16989,16990,he went on spreading it over her belly and breasts and the girl said sleepily we do nt look very much like brothers when we re this way do we,no,hemingway
16991,16992,i m trying to be such a very good girl she said,truly you do nt have to worry darling until night,hemingway
16993,16994,we wo nt let the night things come in the day,at the hotel the postman was having a drink while he waited for the girl to sign for a large forwarding envelope heavy with enclosed letters from her bank in paris,hemingway
16995,16996,there were three letters readdressed from his bank too,it was the first mail since they had sent the hotel as a forwarding address,hemingway
16997,16998,the young man gave the postman five francs and asked him to have another glass of wine with him at the zinc bar,the girl unhooked the key from the board and said i ll go up to the room and get cleaned up and meet you at the cafe,hemingway
16999,17000,after he finished his glass he said goodbye to the postman and walked down along the canal to the cafe,it was good to sit in the shade after walking back bareheaded in the sun from the far beach and it was pleasant and cool in the cafe,hemingway
17001,17002,he ordered a vermouth and soda and took out his pocket knife and slit open his letters,all three envelopes were from his publishers and two of them were fat with clippings and the proofs of advertisements,hemingway
17003,17004,he glanced at the clippings and then read the long letter,it was cheerful and guardedly optimistic,hemingway
17005,17006,it was too early to tell how the book would do but everything looked good,most of the reviews were excellent,hemingway
17007,17008,of course there were some,but that was to be expected,hemingway
17009,17010,sentences had been underlined in the reviews that would probably be used in the future advertisements,his publisher wished he could say more about how the book would do but he never made predictions as to sales,hemingway
17011,17012,it was bad practice,the point was that the book could not have been better received,hemingway
17013,17014,the reception was sensational really,but he would see the clippings,hemingway
17015,17016,the first printing had been five thousand copies and on the strength of the reviews a second printing had been ordered,the upcoming advertisements would carry the phrase now in its second printing,hemingway
17017,17018,his publisher hoped that he was as happy as he deserved to be and taking the rest that he so richly deserved,he sent his best greetings to his wife,hemingway
17019,17020,the young man borrowed a pencil from the waiter and commenced to multiply by one thousand,that was easy,hemingway
17021,17022,ten percent of that was two hundred and fifty dollars,five times that was twelve hundred and fifty dollars,hemingway
17023,17024,deduct seven hundred and fifty dollars for the advance,that left five hundred dollars earned by the first printing,hemingway
17025,17026,now there was the second printing,say that was two thousand,hemingway
17027,17028,that was twelve and a half percent of five thousand dollars,if that was how the contract was,hemingway
17029,17030,that would be six hundred and twentyfive dollars,but maybe it did not go up to twelve and a half percent until ten thousand,hemingway
17031,17032,well it was still five hundred dollars,that would still leave a thousand,hemingway
17033,17034,he started to read the reviews and found that he had drunk the vermouth without ever noticing it,he ordered another and returned the pencil to the waiter,hemingway
17035,17036,he was still reading the reviews when the girl came in bringing her heavy envelope of letters,i did nt know they d come she said,hemingway
17037,17038,let me see them,please let me see them,hemingway
17039,17040,the waiter brought her a vermouth and putting it down saw the picture as the girl unfolded a clipping,cest monsieur,hemingway
17041,17042,he asked,yes it is the girl said and held it up for him to see,hemingway
17043,17044,but differently dressed the waiter said,do they write about the marriage,hemingway
17045,17046,may i see a picture of madame,not about the marriage,hemingway
17047,17048,criticisms of a book by monsieur,magnificent said the waiter who was deeply moved,hemingway
17049,17050,is madame also a writer,no the girl said not looking up from the clippings,hemingway
17051,17052,madame is a housewife,the waiter laughed proudly,hemingway
17053,17054,madame is probably in the cinema,they both read clippings and then the girl put the one she was reading down and said i m frightened by them and all the things they say,hemingway
17055,17056,how can we be us and have the things we have and do what we do and you be this that s in the clippings,i ve had them before the young man said,hemingway
17057,17058,they re bad for you but it does nt last,they re terrible she said,hemingway
17059,17060,they could destroy you if you thought about them or believed them,you do nt think i married you because you are what they say you are in these clippings do you,hemingway
17061,17062,no,i want to read them and then we ll seal them up in the envelope,hemingway
17063,17064,i know you have to read them,i do nt want to be stupid about them,hemingway
17065,17066,but even in an envelope it s awful to have them with us,it s like bringing along somebody s ashes in a jar,hemingway
17067,17068,plenty of people would be happy if their damned husbands had good reviews,i m not plenty of people and you re not my damned husband,hemingway
17069,17070,please let s not fight,we wo nt,hemingway
17071,17072,you read them and if there s anything good you tell me and if they say anything about the book that s intelligent that we do nt know you tell me,the book s made some money already he told her,hemingway
17073,17074,that s wonderful,i m so glad,hemingway
17075,17076,but we know it s good,if the reviews had said it was worthless and it never made a cent i would have been just as proud and just as happy,hemingway
17077,17078,i would nt the young man thought,but he did not say it,hemingway
17079,17080,he went on reading the reviews unfolding them and folding them up again and putting them back in the envelope,the girl sat opening envelopes and reading her letters without interest,hemingway
17081,17082,then she looked out of the cafe at the sea,her face was a dark gold brown and she had brushed her hair straight back from her forehead the way the sea had pulled it when she had come out of the water and where it was cropped close and on her cheeks the sun had burned it to white gold against the brown of her skin,hemingway
17083,17084,she looked out at the sea and her eyes were very sad,then she went back to opening letters,hemingway
17085,17086,there was one long typewritten one that she read with concentration,then she went on opening and reading the other letters,hemingway
17087,17088,the young man looked at her and thought she looked a little as though she were shelling peas,what was in the letters,hemingway
17089,17090,the young man asked,there were checks in some,hemingway
17091,17092,big ones,two,hemingway
17093,17094,that s fine he said,do nt go away like that,hemingway
17095,17096,you always said it never made any difference,have i said anything,hemingway
17097,17098,no,you just went away,hemingway
17099,17100,i m sorry he said,how big are they,hemingway
17101,17102,not much really,but good for us,hemingway
17103,17104,they ve been deposited,it s because i m married,hemingway
17105,17106,i told you it was the best thing for us to be married,i know it does nt mean anything as capital but this is spendable,hemingway
17107,17108,we can spend it and it does nt hurt anybody and it s for that,it does nt have anything to do with regular income nor what i get if i live to be twentyfive or if i ever live to be thirty,hemingway
17109,17110,this is ours for anything we want to do,neither of us will have to worry about balances for a while,hemingway
17111,17112,it s that simple,the book has paid back the advance and made about a thousand dollars he said,hemingway
17113,17114,is nt that awfully good when it s only just come out,it s all right,hemingway
17115,17116,should we have another one of these,he asked,hemingway
17117,17118,let s drink something else,how much vermouth did you drink,hemingway
17119,17120,only the one,i must say it was dull,hemingway
17121,17122,i drank two and did nt even taste them,what is there that s real,hemingway
17123,17124,she said,did you ever drink armagnac and soda,hemingway
17125,17126,that s real enough,good,hemingway
17127,17128,let s try that,the waiter brought the armagnac and the young man told him to bring a cold bottle of perrier water instead of the syphon,hemingway
17129,17130,the waiter poured two large armagnacs and the young man put ice in the big glasses and poured in the perrier,this will fix us he said,hemingway
17131,17132,it s a hell of a thing to drink before lunch though,the girl took a long sip,hemingway
17133,17134,it s good she said,it has a fresh clean healthy ugly taste,hemingway
17135,17136,she took another long sip,i can really feel it,hemingway
17137,17138,can you,yes he said and took a deep breath,hemingway
17139,17140,i can feel it,she drank from the glass again and smiled and the laugh wrinkles came at the corner of her eyes,hemingway
17141,17142,the cold perrier had made the heavy brandy alive,for heroes he said,hemingway
17143,17144,i do nt mind being a hero she said,we re not like other people,hemingway
17145,17146,we do nt have to call each other darling or my dear or my love nor any of that to make a point,darling and my dearest and my very dearest and all that are obscene to me and we call each other by our christian names,hemingway
17147,17148,you know what i m trying to say,why do we have to do other things like everyone does,hemingway
17149,17150,you re a very intelligent girl,all right davie she said,hemingway
17151,17152,why do we have to be stuffy,why do nt we keep on and travel now when it can never be more fun,hemingway
17153,17154,we ll do everything you want,if you d been a european with a lawyer my money would have been yours any way,hemingway
17155,17156,it is yours,the hell with it,hemingway
17157,17158,all right,the hell with it,hemingway
17159,17160,but we ll spend it and i think it s wonderful,you can write afterwards,hemingway
17161,17162,that way we can have the fun before i have a baby for one thing,how do i know when i ll have a baby even,hemingway
17163,17164,now it s all getting dull and dusty talking about it,ca nt we just do it and not talk about it,hemingway
17165,17166,what if i want to write,the minute you re not going to do something it will probably make you want to do it,hemingway
17167,17168,then write stupid,you did nt say you would nt write,hemingway
17169,17170,nobody said anything about worrying if you wrote,did they,hemingway
17171,17172,but somewhere something had been said and now he could not remember it because he had been thinking ahead,if you want to write go ahead and i ll amuse myself,hemingway
17173,17174,i do nt have to leave you when you write do i,but where would you like us to go now when people begin to come here,hemingway
17175,17176,anywhere you want to go,will you do it david,hemingway
17177,17178,for how long,for as long as we want,hemingway
17179,17180,six months,nine months,hemingway
17181,17182,a year,all right he said,hemingway
17183,17184,really,sure,hemingway
17185,17186,you re awfully good,if i did nt love you for anything else i d love you for decisions,hemingway
17187,17188,they re easy to make when you have nt seen how too many of them can turn out,he drank the hero drink but it did not taste so good and he ordered a fresh bottle of cold perrier and made a short drink without ice,hemingway
17189,17190,make me one please,short like yours,hemingway
17191,17192,and then let s let it start and have lunch,please know that,hemingway
17193,17194,i know,i love it the way we were before and i m always your girl,hemingway
17195,17196,do nt ever be lonely,you know that,hemingway
17197,17198,i m how you want but i m how i want too and it is nt as though it was nt for us both,you do nt have to talk,hemingway
17199,17200,i m only telling a story to put you to sleep because you re my good lovely husband and my brother too,i love you and when we go to africa i ll be your african girl too,hemingway
17201,17202,are we going to africa,are nt we,hemingway
17203,17204,do nt you remember,that was what it was about today,hemingway
17205,17206,so we could go there or anywhere,is nt that where we re going,hemingway
17207,17208,why did nt you say it,i did nt want to interfere,hemingway
17209,17210,i said wherever you wanted,i d go anywhere,hemingway
17211,17212,but i thought that was where you wanted,it s too early to go to africa now,hemingway
17213,17214,it s the big rains and after wards the grass is too high and it s very cold,we could go to bed and keep warm and hear the rain on a tin roof,hemingway
17215,17216,no it s too early,the roads turn to mud and you ca nt get around and everything is like a swamp and the grass gets so tall you cans t see,hemingway
17217,17218,then where should we go,we can go to spain but sevilla is over and so is san isidro in madrid and it s early for there too,hemingway
17219,17220,it s too early for the basque coast,it s still cold and rainy,hemingway
17221,17222,it rains everywhere there now,is nt there a hot part where we could swim the way we do here,hemingway
17223,17224,you ca nt swim in spain the way we do here,you d get arrested,hemingway
17225,17226,what a bore,let s wait to go there then because i want us to get darker,hemingway
17227,17228,why do you want to be so dark,i do nt know,hemingway
17229,17230,why do you want anything,right now it s the thing that i want most,hemingway
17231,17232,that we do nt have i mean,does nt it make you excited to have me getting so dark,hemingway
17233,17234,uhhuh,i love it,hemingway
17235,17236,did you think i could ever be this dark,no because you re blond,hemingway
17237,17238,i can because i m lion color and they can go dark,but i want every part of me dark and it s getting that way and you ll be darker than an indian and that takes us further away from other people,hemingway
17239,17240,you see why it s important,what will we be,hemingway
17241,17242,i do nt know,maybe we ll just be us,hemingway
17243,17244,only changed,that s maybe the best thing,hemingway
17245,17246,and we will keep on wo nt we,sure,hemingway
17247,17248,we can go over by the estérel and explore and find another place the way we found this one,we can do that,hemingway
17249,17250,there are lots of wild places and nobody is there in the summer,we could get a car and then we could go everywhere,hemingway
17251,17252,spain too when we want,once we re really dark it wo nt be hard to keep unless we had to live in towns,hemingway
17253,17254,we do nt want to be in towns in the summer,how dark are you going to get,hemingway
17255,17256,as dark as i can,we ll have to see,hemingway
17257,17258,i wish i had some indian blood,i m going to be so dark you wo nt be able to stand it,hemingway
17259,17260,i ca nt wait to go up on the beach tomorrow,she went to sleep that way with her head back and her chin up as though she were in the sun on the beach breathing softly and then she curled toward him on her side and the young man lay awake and thought about the day,hemingway
17261,17262,it is very possible that i could nt get started he thought and it probably is sound to not think about it at all and just enjoy what we have,when i have to work i will,hemingway
17263,17264,nothing can stop that,the last book is good and i must make a better one now,hemingway
17265,17266,this nonsense that we do is fun although i do nt know how much of it is nonsense and how much is serious,drinking brandy at noon is no damn good and already the simple aperitifs mean nothing,hemingway
17267,17268,that is not a good sign,she changes from a girl into a boy and back to a girl carelessly and happily,hemingway
17269,17270,she sleeps easily and beautifully and you will sleep too because all you truly know is that you feel good,you did not sell anything for the money he thought,hemingway
17271,17272,everything she said about the money was true,actually it all was true,hemingway
17273,17274,everything was free for a time,what was it that she had said about destruction,hemingway
17275,17276,he could not remember that,she d said it but he could not remember it,hemingway
17277,17278,then he was tired of trying to remember and he looked at the girl and kissed her cheek very lightly and she did not wake,he loved her very much and everything about her and he went to sleep thinking about her cheek against his lips and how the next day they would both be darker from the sun and how dark can she become he thought and how dark will she ever really be,hemingway
17279,17280,well ahead on the ocean side was the bulk of a big hotel and a casino and on the left there were newly planted trees and basque villas white washed and brown timbered set in their own trees and plantings,the two young people in the car rode down the boulevard slowly looking out at the magnificent beach and at the mountains of spain that showed blue in this light as the car passed the casino and the big hotel and went on toward the end of the boulevard,hemingway
17281,17282,ahead was the mouth of the river that flowed into the ocean,the tide was out and across the bright sand they saw the ancient spanish town and the green hills across the bay and at the far point the lighthouse,hemingway
17283,17284,they stopped the car,it s a lovely place the girl said,hemingway
17285,17286,there s a cafe with tables under the trees the young man said,old trees,hemingway
17287,17288,the trees are strange the girl said,it s all new planting,hemingway
17289,17290,i wonder why they planted mimosas,to compete with where we ye come from,hemingway
17291,17292,i suppose so,it all looks awfully new,hemingway
17293,17294,but it s a wonderful beach,i never saw such a big beach in france nor with such smooth and fine sand,hemingway
17295,17296,biarritz is a horror,let s drive up by the cafe,hemingway
17297,17298,they drove back up the right side of the road,the young man pulled the car to the curb and killed the ignition,hemingway
17299,17300,they crossed to the outdoor cafe and it was pleasant to eat by themselves and be conscious of the people that they did not know eating at the other tables,that night the wind rose and in their corner room high up in the big hotel they heard the heavy fall of the surf on the beach,hemingway
17301,17302,in the dark the young man pulled a light blanket up over the sheet and the girl said are nt you glad we decided to stay,i like to hear the surf pound,hemingway
17303,17304,so do i,they lay close together and listened to the sea,hemingway
17305,17306,her head was on his chest and she moved it against his chin and then moved up in the bed and put her cheek against his and pressed it there,she kissed him and he could feel her hand touching him,hemingway
17307,17308,that s good she said in the darkness,that s lovely,hemingway
17309,17310,you re sure you do nt want me to change,not now,hemingway
17311,17312,now i m cold,please hold me warm,hemingway
17313,17314,i love you when you feel cold against me,if it gets this cold here at night we ll have to wear pyjama tops,hemingway
17315,17316,that will be fun for breakfast in bed,it s the atlantic ocean she said,hemingway
17317,17318,listen to it,we ll have a good time while we re here he told her,hemingway
17319,17320,if you want we ll stay a while,if you want we ll go,hemingway
17321,17322,there are plenty of places to go,we might stay a few days and see,hemingway
17323,17324,good,if we do i d like to start to write,hemingway
17325,17326,that would be wonderful,we ll look around tomorrow,hemingway
17327,17328,you could work here in the room if i were out could nt you,until we found some place,hemingway
17329,17330,sure,you know you must never worry about me because i love you and we re us against all the others,hemingway
17331,17332,please kiss me she said,he kissed her,hemingway
17333,17334,you know i have nt done anything bad to us,i had to do it,hemingway
17335,17336,you know that,he did not say anything and listened to the weight of the surf falling on the hard wet sand in the night,hemingway
17337,17338,the next morning there was still heavy surf and the rain came in gusts,they could not see the spanish coast and when it cleared between the driven squalls of rain and they could see across the angry sea in the bay there were heavy clouds that came down to the base of the mountains,hemingway
17339,17340,catherine had gone out in a raincoat after breakfast and had left him to work in the room,it had gone so simply and easily that he thought it was probably worthless,hemingway
17341,17342,be careful he said to himself it is all very well for you to write simply and the simpler the better,but do not start to think so damned simply,hemingway
17343,17344,know how complicated it is and then state it simply,do you suppose the grau du roi time was all simple because you could write a little of it simply,hemingway
17345,17346,he went on writing in pencil in the cheap lined school notebook that was called a cahier and already numbered one in roman numeral,he stopped finally and put the notebook in a suitcase with a cardboard box of pencils and the coneshaped sharpener leaving the five pencils he had dulled to point up for the next day and took his raincoat from the hanger in the closet and walked down the stairs to the lobby of the hotel,hemingway
17347,17348,he looked into the hotel bar which was gloomy and pleasant in the rain and already had some customers and left his key at the desk,the assistant concierge reached into the mailbox as he hung up the key and said madame left this for monsieur,hemingway
17349,17350,he opened the note which said david did nt want to disturb you am at the cafe love catherine,he put on the old trench coat found a boina in the pocket and walked out of the hotel into the rain,hemingway
17351,17352,she was at a corner table in the small cafe and before her was a clouded yellowtinged drink and a plate with one small dark red freshwater crayfish and the debris of others,she was very far ahead of him,hemingway
17353,17354,where have you been stranger,just down the road a piece,hemingway
17355,17356,he noticed that her face was rainwashed and he concentrated on what rain did to heavily tanned skin,she looked very nice too in spite of it and he was happy to see her this way,hemingway
17357,17358,did you get going,the girl asked,hemingway
17359,17360,good enough,you worked then,hemingway
17361,17362,that s fine,the waiter had been serving three spaniards who were sitting at a table next to the door,hemingway
17363,17364,he came over now holding a glass and an ordinary pernod bottle and a small narrowlipped pitcher of water,there were lumps of ice in the water,hemingway
17365,17366,pour monsieur aussi,he asked,hemingway
17367,17368,yes the young man said,please,hemingway
17369,17370,the waiter poured their high glasses half full of the offyellow liquid and started to pour the water slowly into the girl s glass,but the young man said i ll do it and the waiter took the bottle away,hemingway
17371,17372,he seemed relieved to be taking it away and the young man poured the water in a very thin stream and the girl watched the absinthe cloud opalescently,it felt warm as her fingers held the glass and then as it lost the yellow cast and began to look milky it cooled sharply and the young man let the water fall in a drop at a time,hemingway
17373,17374,why does it have to go in so slowly,the girl asked,hemingway
17375,17376,it breaks up and goes to pieces if the water pours in too fast he explained,then it s flat and worthless,hemingway
17377,17378,there ought to be a glass on top with ice and just a little hole for the water to drip,but everybody would know what it was then,hemingway
17379,17380,i had to drink up fast before because two gn,s were in the girl said,hemingway
17381,17382,whatyoumacallits nationals,in khaki with bicycles and black leather pistol holsters,hemingway
17383,17384,i had to engulp the evidence,engulp,hemingway
17385,17386,sorry,once i engulped it i ca nt say it,hemingway
17387,17388,you want to be careful about absinthe,it only makes me feel easier about things,hemingway
17389,17390,and nothing else does,he finished making the absinthe for her holding it well short of mildness,hemingway
17391,17392,go ahead he told her,do nt wait for me,hemingway
17393,17394,she took a long sip and then he took her glass from her and drank and said thank you maam,that puts heart in a man,hemingway
17395,17396,so make your own you clipping reader she said,what was that,hemingway
17397,17398,the young man said to her,i did nt say it,hemingway
17399,17400,but she had said it and he said to her why do nt you just shut up about the clippings,why,hemingway
17401,17402,she said leaning toward him and speaking too loudly,why should i shut up,hemingway
17403,17404,just because you wrote this morning,do you think i married you because you re a writer,hemingway
17405,17406,you and your clippings,all right the young man said,hemingway
17407,17408,can you tell me the rest of it when we re by ourselves,do nt ever think for a moment i wo nt she said,hemingway
17409,17410,i guess not he said,do nt guess she said,hemingway
17411,17412,you can be certain,david bourne stood up and went over to the hanger and lifted his raincoat and went out the door without looking back,hemingway
17413,17414,at the table catherine raised her glass and tasted the absinthe very carefully and went on tasting it in little sips,the door opened and david came back in and walked up to the table,hemingway
17415,17416,he was wearing his trench coat and had his boina pulled low on his forehead,do you have the keys to the car,hemingway
17417,17418,yes she said,may i have them,hemingway
17419,17420,she gave them to him but said do nt be stupid david,it was the rain and you being the only one who had worked,hemingway
17421,17422,sit down,do you want me to,hemingway
17423,17424,please she said,he sat down,hemingway
17425,17426,that did nt make much sense he thought,you got up to go out and take the damned car and stay out and the hell with her and then you come back in and have to ask for the key and then sit down like a slob,hemingway
17427,17428,he picked up his glass and took a drink,the drink was good anyway,hemingway
17429,17430,what are you going to do about lunch,he asked,hemingway
17431,17432,you say where and i ll eat it with you,you do still love me do nt you,hemingway
17433,17434,do nt be silly,that was a sordid quarrel catherine said,hemingway
17435,17436,let s not mention the god damned clippings,that s what it was all about,hemingway
17437,17438,it was you thinking about them when you were drinking,bringing them up because you were drinking,hemingway
17439,17440,it sounds like regurgitating she said,awful,hemingway
17441,17442,actually my tongue just slipped making a joke,you had to have them in your head to bring them out that way,hemingway
17443,17444,all right she said,i thought maybe it was all over,hemingway
17445,17446,it is,well why do you keep on insisting and insisting about it for then,hemingway
17447,17448,we should nt have taken this drink,no,hemingway
17449,17450,of course not,especially me,hemingway
17451,17452,but you certainly needed it,do you think it will do you any good,hemingway
17453,17454,do we have to do this now,he asked,hemingway
17455,17456,i m certainly going to stop it,it bores me,hemingway
17457,17458,that s the one damned word in the language i ca nt stand,lucky you with only one word like that in the language,hemingway
17459,17460,oh shit he said,eat lunch by yourself,hemingway
17461,17462,no,i wo nt,hemingway
17463,17464,we ll eat lunch together and behave like human beings,all right,hemingway
17465,17466,i m sorry,it really was a joke and it just misfired,hemingway
17467,17468,truly david that was all,the hills showed green and new washed and the clouds had gone from the mountains,hemingway
17469,17470,catherine was still sleeping and he looked at her and watched her regular breathing and the sun on her face and thought how strange that the sun on her eyes should not wake her,after he had taken a shower and brushed his teeth and shaved he was hungry for breakfast but he pulled on a pair of shorts and a sweater and found his notebook and pencils and the sharpener and sat at the table by the window that looked out over the estuary of the river to spain,hemingway
17471,17472,he started to write and he forgot about catherine and what he saw from the window and the writing went by itself as it did with him when he was lucky,he wrote it exactly and the sinister part only showed as the light feathering of a smooth swell on a calm day marking the reef beneath,hemingway
17473,17474,when he had worked for a time he looked at catherine still sleeping her lips smiling now and the rectangle of sunlight from the open window falling across the brown of her body and lighting her dark face and tawny head against the rumpled white of the sheet and the unused pillow,it s too late to get breakfast now he thought,hemingway
17475,17476,i ll leave a note and go down to the cafe and get a café creme and something,but while he was putting his work away catherine woke and came over to him as he was closing the suitcase and put her arms around him and kissed him on the back of his neck and said i m your lazy naked wife,hemingway
17477,17478,what did you wake up for,i do nt know,hemingway
17479,17480,but tell me where you re going and i ll be there in five minutes,i m going to the cafe to get some breakfast,hemingway
17481,17482,go ahead and i ll join you,you worked did nt you,hemingway
17483,17484,sure,were nt you wonderful to after yesterday and everything,hemingway
17485,17486,i m so proud,kiss me and look at us in the mirror on the bath room door,hemingway
17487,17488,he kissed her and they looked into the full length mirror,it s so nice not to feel overdressed she said,hemingway
17489,17490,you be good and do nt get in any trouble on your way to the cafe,order me an oeuf au jambon too,hemingway
17491,17492,do nt wait for me,i m sorry i made you wait so long for breakfast,hemingway
17493,17494,at the cafe he found the morning paper and the paris papers of the day before and had his coffee and milk and the bayonne ham with a big beautifully fresh egg that he ground coarse pepper over sparsely and spread a little mustard on before he broke the yolk,when catherine had not come and her egg was in danger of getting cold he ate it too swabbing the flat dish clean with a piece of the fresh baked bread,hemingway
17495,17496,here comes madame the waiter said,i ll bring another plat for her,hemingway
17497,17498,she had put on a skirt and cashmere sweater and pearls and the toweled her head but combed it damp and straight and wet and the tawny color of her hair did not show to make the contrast with her incredibly darkened face,it s such a beautiful day she said,hemingway
17499,17500,i m sorry to be late,where are you dressed for,hemingway
17501,17502,biarritz,i thought i d drive in,hemingway
17503,17504,do you want to come,you want to go alone,hemingway
17505,17506,yes she said,but you re welcome,hemingway
17507,17508,as he stood she said i m going to bring you back a surprise,no do nt,hemingway
17509,17510,yes,and you ll like it,hemingway
17511,17512,let me go along and keep you from doing anything crazy,no,hemingway
17513,17514,it s better if i do it alone,i ll be back in the afternoon,hemingway
17515,17516,and do nt wait for lunch,david read the papers and then walked out through the town looking for chalets that might be for rent or for a part of town that might be good to live in and found the newly built up area pleasant but dull,hemingway
17517,17518,he loved the view across the bay and the estuary to the spanish side and the old gray stone of fuenterrabiá and shining white of the houses that spread out from it and the brown mountains with the blue shadows,he wondered why the storm had gone so quickly and thought it must have been only the northern edge of a storm that came in across the bay of biscay,hemingway
17519,17520,biscay was vizcaya but that was the basque province further down the coast well beyond san sebastian,the mountains that he saw beyond the roofs of the border town of irun were in guipuzcoa and beyond them would be navarra and navarra was navarre,hemingway
17521,17522,and what are we doing here he thought and what am i doing walking through a beach resort town looking at newly planted magnolias and bloody mimosas and watching for torent signs on phony basque villas,you did nt work hard enough this morning to make your brain that stupid or are you just hung over from yesterday,hemingway
17523,17524,you did nt work at all really,and you better soon because everything s going too fast and you re going with it and you ll be through before ever you know it,hemingway
17525,17526,maybe you re through now,all right,hemingway
17527,17528,do nt start,at least you remember that much,hemingway
17529,17530,and he walked on through the town his vision sharpened by spleen and tempered by the ash beauty of the day,the breeze from the sea was blowing through the room and he was reading with his shoulders and the small of his back against two pillows and another folded behind his head,hemingway
17531,17532,he was sleepy after lunch but he felt hollow with waiting for her and he read and waited,then he heard the door open and she came in and for an instant he did not know her,hemingway
17533,17534,she stood there with her hands below her breasts on the cashmere sweater and breathing as though she had been running,oh no she said,hemingway
17535,17536,no,then she was on the bed pushing her head against him saying no,hemingway
17537,17538,no,please david,hemingway
17539,17540,do nt you at all,he held her head close against his chest and felt it smooth close clipped and coarsely silky and she pushed it hard against him again and again,hemingway
17541,17542,what did you do devil,she raised her head and looked at him and her lips pressed against his and she moved them from side to side and moved on the bed so her body was pressed against his,hemingway
17543,17544,now i can tell she said,i m so glad,hemingway
17545,17546,it was such a big chance,i m your new girl now so we d better find out,hemingway
17547,17548,let me see,i ll show you but let me go a minute,hemingway
17549,17550,she came back and stood by the bed with the sun on her through the window,she had dropped the skirt and was bare foot wearing only the sweater and the pearls,hemingway
17551,17552,take a good look she said,because this is how i am,hemingway
17553,17554,he took a good look at the long dark legs the straight standing body the dark face and the sculptured tawny head and she looked at him and said thank you,how did you do it,hemingway
17555,17556,can i tell you in bed,if you tell me in a hurry,hemingway
17557,17558,no,not in a hurry,hemingway
17559,17560,let me tell,first i had the idea on the road somewhere after aix en provence,hemingway
17561,17562,at nimes when we were walking in the garden i think,but i did nt know how it would work or how to tell them how to do it,hemingway
17563,17564,then i thought it out and yesterday i decided,david stroked his hand over her head from her neck over the top of her head to her forehead,hemingway
17565,17566,let me tell she said,i knew they must have good coiffeurs in biarritz because of the english,hemingway
17567,17568,so when i got there i went to the best place and i told the coiffeur that i wanted it all brushed forward and he brushed it and it came down to my nose and i could hardly see through it and i said i wanted it cut like a boy when he would first go to public school,he asked me what school so i said eton or winchester because they were the only schools i could remember except rugby and i did nt want rugby certainly,hemingway
17569,17570,he said which,so i said eton but forward all the way,hemingway
17571,17572,so after he was finished and i looked like the most attractive girl who ever went to eton i just had him keep on shortening it until eton was all gone and then i had him keep on shortening it,then he said very severely that is not an eton crop mademoiselle,hemingway
17573,17574,and i said i did nt want an eton crop monsieur,that was the only way i knew how to explain what i wanted and it is madame not mademoiselle,hemingway
17575,17576,so then i had him shorten it some more and then i kept him shortening it and it is either wonderful or terrible,you do nt mind it on my forehead,hemingway
17577,17578,when it was eton it fell in my eye,it s wonderful,hemingway
17579,17580,it s awfully classic she said,but it feels like an animal,hemingway
17581,17582,feel it,he felt it,hemingway
17583,17584,do nt worry about it being too classic she said,my mouth balances it,hemingway
17585,17586,now can we make love,she bent her head forward and he pulled the sweater over her head and down off her arms and bent over her neck to unhook the safety clasp,hemingway
17587,17588,no leave them,she lay back on the bed her brown legs tight together and her head against the flat sheet the pearls slanted away from the dark rise of her breasts,hemingway
17589,17590,her eyes were shut and her arms were by her sides,she was a new girl and he saw her mouth was changed too,hemingway
17591,17592,she was breathing very carefully and she said you do everything,from the beginning,hemingway
17593,17594,from the very beginning,is this the beginning,hemingway
17595,17596,oh yes,and do nt wait too long,hemingway
17597,17598,i thought you would nt and it was lovely,you were so loyal to me,hemingway
17599,17600,did you think it was a dream,do nt wake,hemingway
17601,17602,i m going to sleep but if i do nt i ll be a wild girl,she stays awake and takes care of you,hemingway
17603,17604,you sleep and know i m here,please sleep,hemingway
17605,17606,in the morning when he woke there was the lovely body that he knew close against him and he looked and saw the waxedwood dark shoulders and neck and the fair tawny head close and smooth lying as a small animal and he shifted down in the bed and turned toward her and kissed her forehead with her hair under his lips and then her eyes and then gently her mouth,i m asleep,hemingway
17607,17608,so was i,i know,hemingway
17609,17610,feel how strange,all night it was wonderful how strange,hemingway
17611,17612,not strange,say so if you want,hemingway
17613,17614,oh we fit so wonderfully,can we both go to sleep,hemingway
17615,17616,do you want to be asleep,us both asleep,hemingway
17617,17618,i ll try,are you asleep,hemingway
17619,17620,no,please try,hemingway
17621,17622,i m trying,shut your eyes then,hemingway
17623,17624,how can you sleep if you wo nt shut your eyes,i like to see you in the morning all new and strange,hemingway
17625,17626,was i good to invent it,do nt talk,hemingway
17627,17628,it s the only way to slow things,i have already,hemingway
17629,17630,could nt you tell,of course you could,hemingway
17631,17632,let s have breakfast in bed she said,and can we have champagne if it s not wicked,hemingway
17633,17634,in the brut they have lanson and perrierjouet of the good,may i ring,hemingway
17635,17636,yes he said and went under the shower,before he put it on full force he could hear her voice on the telephone,hemingway
17637,17638,when he came out she was sitting back very formally against two pillows with all the pillows neatly shaken out and placed two and two at the head of the bed,do i look all right with my head wet,hemingway
17639,17640,it s just damp,you dried it with the towel,hemingway
17641,17642,i can cut it shorter on the forehead,i can do that myself,hemingway
17643,17644,or you can,i d like it if it came over your eyes,hemingway
17645,17646,maybe it will she said,who knows,hemingway
17647,17648,maybe we ll get tired of being classical,and today we ll stay on the beach all through noon,hemingway
17649,17650,we ll go way far down it and we can tan really when the people all come in for lunch and then we ll ride to st,jean to eat when we re hungry at the bar basque,hemingway
17651,17652,but first you ll make us go to the beach because we need to,good,hemingway
17653,17654,david moved a chair over and put his hand close on hers and she looked at him and said two days ago i understood everything and then the absinthe made me turn on it,i know david told her,hemingway
17655,17656,you could nt help it,but i hurt you about the clippings,hemingway
17657,17658,no he said,you tried,hemingway
17659,17660,you did nt make it,i m so sorry david,hemingway
17661,17662,please believe me,everybody has strange things that mean things to them,hemingway
17663,17664,you could nt help it,no the girl said and shook her head,hemingway
17665,17666,it s all right then david said,do nt cry,hemingway
17667,17668,it s all right,i never cry she said,hemingway
17669,17670,but i ca nt help it,i know it and you re beautiful when you cry,hemingway
17671,17672,no,do nt say it,hemingway
17673,17674,but i never cried before did i,never,hemingway
17675,17676,but will it be bad for you if we stay here just two days on the beach,we have nt had any chance to swim and it would be silly to have been here and not to swim,hemingway
17677,17678,where are we going to go when we leave here,oh,hemingway
17679,17680,we have nt decided yet,we ll probably decide tonight or in the morning,hemingway
17681,17682,where would you suggest,i think anywhere would be fine david said,hemingway
17683,17684,well maybe that s where we will go,it s a big place,hemingway
17685,17686,it s nice to be alone though and i ll pack us nicely,there s nothing much to do except put in toilet things and close two bags,hemingway
17687,17688,we can leave in the morning if you want,truly i do nt want to do anything to you or have any bad effect on you,hemingway
17689,17690,the waiter knocked on the door,there was no more perrierjouet madame so i brought the lanson,hemingway
17691,17692,she had stopped crying and david s hand was still close on hers and he said i know,it was cool and very old,hemingway
17693,17694,there were wine casks around the walls,the tables were old and thick and the chairs were worn,hemingway
17695,17696,the light came from the door,the waiter brought them glasses of manzanilla from the lowland near cadiz called the marismas with thin slices of jamón serrano a smoky hard cured ham from pigs that fed on acorns and bright red spicy salchichón another even spicier dark sausage from a town called vich and anchovies and garlic olives,hemingway
17697,17698,they ate these and drank more of the manzanilla which was light and nutty tasting,catherine had a spanishenglish method book with a green cover on the table close to her hand and david had a stack of the morning papers,hemingway
17699,17700,it was a hot day but cool in the old building and the waiter asked do you want gazpacho,he was an old man and he filled their glasses again,hemingway
17701,17702,do you think the señorita would like it,try her the waiter said gravely as though he were speaking of a mare,hemingway
17703,17704,it came in a large bowl with ice floating with the slices of crisp cucumber tomato garlic bread green and red peppers and the coarsely peppered liquid that tasted lightly of oil and vinegar,it s a salad soup catherine said,hemingway
17705,17706,it s delicious,es gazpacho the waiter said,hemingway
17707,17708,they drank valdepeñas now from a big pitcher and it started to build with the foundation of the marismeño only held back temporarily by the dilution of the gazpacho which it moved in on confidently,it built solidly,hemingway
17709,17710,what is this wine,catherine asked,hemingway
17711,17712,it s an african wine david said,they always say that africa begins at the pyrenees catherine said,hemingway
17713,17714,i remember how impressed i was when i first heard it,that s one of those easy sayings david said,hemingway
17715,17716,it s more complicated than that,just drink it,hemingway
17717,17718,but how can i tell about where africa begins if i ve never been there,people are always telling you tricky things,hemingway
17719,17720,sure,you can tell,hemingway
17721,17722,the basque country certainly was nt like africa or anything i ever heard about africa,neither is asturias nor galicia but once you re in from the coast it gets to be africa fast enough,hemingway
17723,17724,but why did nt they ever paint that country,catherine asked,hemingway
17725,17726,in all the backgrounds it is always the mountains out by the escorial,the sierra david said,hemingway
17727,17728,nobody wanted to buy pictures of castilla the way you saw it,they never did have landscape painters,hemingway
17729,17730,the painters painted what was ordered,except greco s toledo,hemingway
17731,17732,it s terrible to have such a wonderful country and no good painters ever paint it catherine said,what should we eat after the gazpacho,hemingway
17733,17734,david said,the proprietor who was a short middleaged man heavily built and square faced had come over,hemingway
17735,17736,he thinks we ought to have meat of some kind,hay solomillo muy bueno the owner insisted,hemingway
17737,17738,no please catherine said,just a salad,hemingway
17739,17740,well at least drink a little wine the proprietor said and refilled the pitcher from the spigot of the cask behind the bar,i should nt drink catherine said,hemingway
17741,17742,i m sorry i m talking so much,i m sorry if i talked stupidly,hemingway
17743,17744,i usually do,you talk very interestingly and awfully well for a hot day like this,hemingway
17745,17746,does the wine make you talkative,it s a different sort of talkative than absinthe catherine said,hemingway
17747,17748,it does nt feel dangerous,i ve started on my good new life and i m reading now and looking outward and trying not to think about myself so much and i m going to keep it up but we ought not to be in any town this time of year,hemingway
17749,17750,maybe we ll go,the whole way here i saw wonderful things to paint and i ca nt paint at all and never could,hemingway
17751,17752,but i know wonderful things to write and i ca nt even write a letter that is nt stupid,i never wanted to be a painter nor a writer until i came to this country,hemingway
17753,17754,now it s just like being hungry all the time and there s nothing you can ever do about it,the country is here,hemingway
17755,17756,you do nt have to do anything about it,it s always here,hemingway
17757,17758,the prado s here david said,there s nothing except through yourself she said,hemingway
17759,17760,and i do nt want to die and it be gone,you have every mile we drove,hemingway
17761,17762,all the yellow country and the white hills and the chaff blowing and the long lines of poplars by the road,you know what you saw and what you felt and it s yours,hemingway
17763,17764,do nt you have le grau du roi and aigues mortes and all the camargue that we rode through on our bikes,this will be the same,hemingway
17765,17766,but what about when i m dead,then you re dead,hemingway
17767,17768,but i ca nt stand to be dead,then do nt let it happen till it happens,hemingway
17769,17770,look at things and listen and feel,what if i ca nt remember,hemingway
17771,17772,he had spoken about death as though it did not matter,she drank the wine and looked at the thick stone walls in which there were only small windows with bars high up that gave onto a narrow street where the sun did not shine,hemingway
17773,17774,the doorway though gave onto an arcade and the bright sunlight on the worn stones of the square,when you start to live outside yourself catherine said it s all dangerous,hemingway
17775,17776,maybe i d better go back into our world your and my world that i made up we made up i mean,i was a great success in that world,hemingway
17777,17778,it was only four weeks ago,i think maybe i will be again,hemingway
17779,17780,the salad came and then there was its greenness on the dark table and the sun on the plaza beyond the arcade,do you feel better,hemingway
17781,17782,david asked,yes she said,hemingway
17783,17784,i was thinking so much about myself that i was getting impossible again like a painter and i was my own picture,it was awful,hemingway
17785,17786,now that i m all right again i hope it still lasts,it had rained hard and now the heat was broken,hemingway
17787,17788,they were in the cool shutterslatted dimness of the big room in the palace and had bathed together in the deep water in the long deep tub and then had turned the plug and let the full force of the water splash and flow over them swirling as it drained away,they had blotted each other with the huge towels and then come to the bed,hemingway
17789,17790,as they lay on the bed there was a cool breeze that came through the slats of the blinds and moved over them,catherine lay propped on her elbows with her chin on her hands,hemingway
17791,17792,do you think it would be fun if i went back to being a boy again,it would nt be any trouble,hemingway
17793,17794,i like you the way you are now,it s sort of tempting,hemingway
17795,17796,but i should nt do it in spain i suppose,it s such a formal country,hemingway
17797,17798,stay the way you are,what makes your voice be different when you say it,hemingway
17799,17800,i think i ll do it,no,hemingway
17801,17802,not now,thank you for the not now,hemingway
17803,17804,should i make love this time as a girl and then do it,you re a girl,hemingway
17805,17806,you are a girl,you re my lovely girl catherine,hemingway
17807,17808,yes i am your girl and i love you and i love you and i love you,do nt talk,hemingway
17809,17810,yes i will,i m your girl catherine and i love you please i love you always always you do nt have to keep saying it,hemingway
17811,17812,i can tell,i like to say it and i have to say it and i ve been a fine girl and a good girl and i will again,hemingway
17813,17814,i promise i will again,you do nt have to say it,hemingway
17815,17816,oh yes i do,i say it and i said it and you said it,hemingway
17817,17818,you now please,please you,hemingway
17819,17820,they lay quiet for a long time and she said i love you so much and you re such a good husband,you blessed,hemingway
17821,17822,was i what you wanted,what do you think,hemingway
17823,17824,i hope i was,you were,hemingway
17825,17826,i promised truly and i will and i ll keep it,now can i be a boy again,hemingway
17827,17828,why,just for a little while,hemingway
17829,17830,why,i loved it and i do nt miss it but i d like to be again in bed at night if it is nt bad for you,hemingway
17831,17832,can i be again,if it s not bad for you,hemingway
17833,17834,the hell with if it s bad for me,then can i,hemingway
17835,17836,do you really want to,he had kept from saying have to so she said i do nt have to but please if it s all right,hemingway
17837,17838,can i please,all right,hemingway
17839,17840,he kissed her and held her to him,nobody can tell which way i am but us,hemingway
17841,17842,i ll only be a boy at night and wo nt embarrass you,do nt worry about it please,hemingway
17843,17844,all right boy,i lied when i said i did nt have to,hemingway
17845,17846,it came so suddenly today,he shut his eyes and did not think and she kissed him and it had gone further now and he could tell and feel the desperateness,hemingway
17847,17848,now you change,please,hemingway
17849,17850,do nt make me change you,must i,hemingway
17851,17852,all right i will,you re changed now,hemingway
17853,17854,you are,you did it too,hemingway
17855,17856,you are,you did it too,hemingway
17857,17858,i did it to you but you did it,yes you did,hemingway
17859,17860,you re my sweet dearest darling catherine,you re my sweet my lovely catherine,hemingway
17861,17862,you re my girl my dearest only girl,then she moved away very slowly lifting herself lightly on her elbows and said i have a wonderful surprise for myself for tomorrow,hemingway
17863,17864,i m going to the prado in the morning and see all the pictures as a boy,i give up david said,hemingway
17865,17866,he walked in the street up the hill to the plaza santa ana and had breakfast at a cafe and read the local papers,catherine had wanted to be at the prado at ten when it opened and before he left he had set the alarm to wake her at nine,hemingway
17867,17868,outside on the street walking up the hill he had thought of her sleeping the beautiful rumpled head that looked like an ancient coin lying against the white sheet the pillow pushed away the upper sheet showing the curves of her body,it lasted a month he thought or almost,hemingway
17869,17870,and the other time from le grau du roi to hendaye was two months,no less because she started thinking of it in nimes,hemingway
17871,17872,it was nt two months,we ve been married three months and two weeks and i hope i make her happy always but in this i do not think anybody can take care of anybody,hemingway
17873,17874,it s enough to stay in it,the difference is that she asked this time he told himself,hemingway
17875,17876,she did ask,when he had read the papers and then paid for his breakfast and walked out into the heat that had come back to the plateau when the wind had changed he made his way to the cool formal sad politeness of the bank where he found mail that had been forwarded from paris,hemingway
17877,17878,he opened and read mail while he waited through the lengthy manywindowed formalities of cashing a draft which had been sent from his bank to this their madrid correspondent,finally with the heavy notes buttoned into his jacket pocket he came out into the glare again and stopped at the newsstand to buy the english and american papers that had come in on the morning sud express,hemingway
17879,17880,he bought some bullfight weeklies to wrap the english language papers in and then walked down the carrera san geronimo to the cool friendly morning gloom of the buffet italianos,there was no one in the place yet and he remembered that he had made no rendezvous with catherine,hemingway
17881,17882,what will you drink,the waiter asked him,hemingway
17883,17884,beer he said,this is nt a beer place,hemingway
17885,17886,do nt you have beer,yes,hemingway
17887,17888,but it s not a beer place,up yours he said and rerolled the papers and went out and walked across the street and back on the other side to turn to the left into the calle vittoria and on to the cervezería alvarez,hemingway
17889,17890,he sat at a table under the awning in the passageway and drank a big cold glass of the draft beer,the waiter was probably only making conversation he thought and what the man said was quite true,hemingway
17891,17892,it is nt a beer place,he was just being literal,hemingway
17893,17894,he was nt being insolent,that was a very bad thing to say and he had no defense against it,hemingway
17895,17896,it was a shitty thing to do,he drank a second beer and called the waiter to pay,hemingway
17897,17898,y la señora,the waiter said,hemingway
17899,17900,at the museo del prado,i m going to get her,hemingway
17901,17902,well until you get back the waiter said,he walked back to the hotel by a downhill shortcut,hemingway
17903,17904,the key was at the desk so he rode up to their floor and left the papers and the mail on a table in the room and locked most of the money in his suitcase,the room was made up and the shutters were lowered against the heat so that the room was darkened,hemingway
17905,17906,he washed and then sorted through his mail and took four letters out and put them in his hip pocket,he took the paris editions of the new york herald the chicago tribune and the london daily mail down with him to the bar of the hotel stopping at the desk to leave the key and to ask the clerk to tell madame when she came in that he was in the bar,hemingway
17907,17908,he sat on a stool at the bar and ordered a marismeño and opened and read his letters while he ate the garlicflavored olives from the saucer the bartender had placed before him with his glass,one of the letters had two cuttings of reviews of his novel from monthly magazines and he read them with no feeling that they dealt with him or with anything that he had written,hemingway
17909,17910,he put the cuttings back in the envelope,they had been understanding and perceptive reviews but to him they had meant nothing,hemingway
17911,17912,he read the letter from the publisher with the same detachment,the book had sold well and they thought that it might continue selling on into the fall although nobody could ever tell about such things,hemingway
17913,17914,certainly so far it had received an extraordinarily fine critical reception and the way would be open for his next book,it was a great advantage that this was his second and not his first novel,hemingway
17915,17916,it was tragic how often first novels were the only good novels american writers had in them,but this his publisher went on his second validated all the promise his first had shown,hemingway
17917,17918,it was an unusual summer in new york cold and wet,oh christ david thought the hell with how it was in new york and the hell with that thinlipped bastard coolidge fishing for trout in a high stiff collar in a fish hatchery in the black hills we stole from the sioux and the cheyenne and bathtubginnedup writers wondering if their baby does the charleston,hemingway
17919,17920,and the hell with the promise he had validated,what promise to whom,hemingway
17921,17922,to the dial to the bookman to the new republic,no he had shown it,hemingway
17923,17924,let me show you my promise that i m going to validate it,what shit,hemingway
17925,17926,hello young man said a voice,what are you looking so indignant about,hemingway
17927,17928,hello colonel david said and felt suddenly happy,what the hell are you doing here,hemingway
17929,17930,the colonel who had deep blue eyes sandy hair and a tanned face that looked as though it had been carved out of flint by a tired sculptor who had broken his chisel on it picked up david s glass and tasted the marismeño,bring me a bottle of whatever this young man is drinking to that table he said to the bartender,hemingway
17931,17932,bring a cold bottle,you do nt need to ice it,hemingway
17933,17934,bring it immediately,yes sir said the bartender,hemingway
17935,17936,very good sir,come along the colonel said to david leading him to the table in the corner of the room,hemingway
17937,17938,you re looking very well,so are you,hemingway
17939,17940,colonel john boyle was wearing a dark blue suit of a cloth that looked stiff but cool and a blue shirt and black tie,i m always well he said,hemingway
17941,17942,do you want a job,no said david,hemingway
17943,17944,just like that,do nt even ask what it is his voice sounded as though he had hawked it up out of a dusty throat,hemingway
17945,17946,the wine came and the waiter filled two glasses and put down saucers of the garlic olives and of hazelnuts,no anchovies,hemingway
17947,17948,the colonel asked,what sort of a fonda is this,hemingway
17949,17950,the bartender smiled and went for the anchovies,excellent wine the colonel said,hemingway
17951,17952,first rate,i always hoped your taste would improve,hemingway
17953,17954,now why do nt you want a job,you ve just finished a book,hemingway
17955,17956,i m on my honeymoon,silly expression the colonel said,hemingway
17957,17958,i never liked it,it sounds sticky,hemingway
17959,17960,why did nt you say you ve just been married,it makes no difference,hemingway
17961,17962,you d be worthless in any event,what was the job,hemingway
17963,17964,no use talking about it now,who did you marry,hemingway
17965,17966,anyone i know,catherine hill,hemingway
17967,17968,knew her father,very odd type,hemingway
17969,17970,killed himself in a car,his wife too,hemingway
17971,17972,i never knew them,you never knew him,hemingway
17973,17974,no,strange,hemingway
17975,17976,but perfectly understandable,he s no loss to you as a fatherinlaw,hemingway
17977,17978,the mother was very lonely they say,stupid way for grown up people to be killed,hemingway
17979,17980,where did you meet this girl,in paris,hemingway
17981,17982,she has a silly uncle who lives there,he s really worthless,hemingway
17983,17984,do you know him,i ve seen him at the races,hemingway
17985,17986,at longchamps and auteuil,how could you help it,hemingway
17987,17988,i did nt marry her family,of course not,hemingway
17989,17990,but you always do,dead or alive,hemingway
17991,17992,not the uncles and aunts,well anyway have fun,hemingway
17993,17994,you know i liked the book,has it done well,hemingway
17995,17996,it s done pretty well,it moved me very deeply the colonel said,hemingway
17997,17998,you re a deceptive son of a bitch,so are you john,hemingway
17999,18000,i hope so the colonel said,david saw catherine at the door and stood up,hemingway
18001,18002,she came over to them and david said this is colonel boyle,how do you do my dear,hemingway
18003,18004,catherine looked at him and smiled and sat down at the table,david watched her and it seemed as though she were holding her breath,hemingway
18005,18006,are you tired,david asked,hemingway
18007,18008,i think so,have a glass of this the colonel said,hemingway
18009,18010,would it be all right if i had an absinthe,of course david said,hemingway
18011,18012,i ll have one too,not for me the colonel said to the bartender,hemingway
18013,18014,this bottle s lost its freshness,put it back to chill and bring me a glass from a cold bottle,hemingway
18015,18016,do you like the real pernod,he asked catherine,hemingway
18017,18018,yes she said,i m shy with people and it helps,hemingway
18019,18020,it s an excellent drink he said,i d join you but i have work i must do after lunch,hemingway
18021,18022,i m sorry i forgot to make a rendezvous david said,this is very nice,hemingway
18023,18024,i stopped by for the mail at the bank,there s quite a lot for you,hemingway
18025,18026,i left it in the room,i do nt care about it she said,hemingway
18027,18028,i saw you in the prado looking at the grecos the colonel said,i saw you too she said,hemingway
18029,18030,do you always look at pictures as though you owned them and were deciding how to have them rehung properly,probably the colonel said,hemingway
18031,18032,do you always look at them as though you were the young chief of a warrior tribe who had gotten loose from his councillors and was looking at that marble of leda and the swan,catherine blushed under her dark tan and looked at david and then at the colonel,hemingway
18033,18034,i like you she said,tell me some more,hemingway
18035,18036,i like you he said,and i envy david,hemingway
18037,18038,is he everything you want,do nt you know,hemingway
18039,18040,to me the visible world is visible the colonel said,now go on and take another sip of that wormwoodtasting truth serum,hemingway
18041,18042,i do nt need it now,are nt you shy now,hemingway
18043,18044,drink it anyway,it s good for you,hemingway
18045,18046,you re the darkest white girl i ve ever seen,your father was very dark though,hemingway
18047,18048,i must have his skin,my mother was very fair,hemingway
18049,18050,i never knew her,did you know my father well,hemingway
18051,18052,quite well,how was he,hemingway
18053,18054,he was a very difficult and charming man,are you really shy,hemingway
18055,18056,truly,ask david,hemingway
18057,18058,you get over it awfully quickly,you rode over it,hemingway
18059,18060,how was my father,he was the shyest man i ever knew and he could be the most charming,hemingway
18061,18062,did he have to use pernod too,he used everything,hemingway
18063,18064,do i remind you of him,not at all,hemingway
18065,18066,that s good,does david,hemingway
18067,18068,not in the least,that s even better,hemingway
18069,18070,how did you know i was a boy in the prado,why should nt you be,hemingway
18071,18072,i only started it again last evening,i was a girl for almost a month,hemingway

18077,18078,it s fine with me,but you re not,hemingway
18079,18080,i just wanted to say it she said,now that i said it i do nt have to be it,hemingway
18081,18082,but it was wonderful in the prado,that was why i wanted to tell david about it,hemingway
18083,18084,you ll have plenty of time to tell david,yes she said,hemingway
18085,18086,we have time for things,tell me where you got so dark the colonel said,hemingway
18087,18088,do you know how dark you are,that was from le grau du roi and then not far from la napoule,hemingway
18089,18090,there was a cove there with a trail that went down to it through the pines,you could nt see it from the road,hemingway
18091,18092,how long did it take to get so dark,about three months,hemingway
18093,18094,and what are you going to do with it,wear it she said,hemingway
18095,18096,it s very becoming in bed,i should nt think you d want to waste it in town,hemingway
18097,18098,the prado is nt wasting,i do nt really wear it,hemingway
18099,18100,it s me,i really am this dark,hemingway
18101,18102,the sun just develops it,i wish i was darker,hemingway

18105,18106,just every day catherine said,i look forward to every day,hemingway
18107,18108,and has today been a good one,yes,hemingway
18109,18110,you know it has,you were there,hemingway

18115,18116,do nt you want to finish your drink,david asked,hemingway
18117,18118,i do nt care about it she said,do nt worry about me,hemingway
18119,18120,i wo nt be shy,she walked to the door and they both looked after her,hemingway
18121,18122,was i too rough,the colonel asked,hemingway
18123,18124,i hope not,she s a very lovely girl,hemingway
18125,18126,i just hope i m good for her,you are,hemingway
18127,18128,how are you doing yourself,all right i think,hemingway

18133,18134,you think so,i m quite sure,hemingway
18135,18136,if you do nt it does nt matter,nothing will matter then,hemingway
18137,18138,how fast will it go,i did nt say anything about speed,hemingway
18139,18140,what are you talking about,sorry,hemingway
18141,18142,it s what you have so have a lovely time,we do,hemingway
18143,18144,so i see,there s only one thing,hemingway

18149,18150,there is nt any get yet,it s kinder to shoot the get,hemingway
18151,18152,kinder,better,hemingway
18153,18154,they talked about people for a while the colonel speaking outrageously and then david saw catherine come through the door wearing a white sharkskin outfit to show how really dark she was,you do really look extraordinarily beautiful the colonel said to catherine,hemingway
18155,18156,but you must try to get darker,thank you,hemingway
18157,18158,i will she said,we do nt have to go out now in the heat do we,hemingway
18159,18160,ca nt we sit here in the cool,we can eat here in the grill,hemingway
18161,18162,you re lunching with me the colonel said,no please,hemingway
18163,18164,you re lunching with us,david stood up uncertainly,hemingway
18165,18166,there were more people at the bar now,looking down at the table he saw that he had drunk catherine s drink as well as his own,hemingway
18167,18168,he did not remember drinking either of them,it was the siesta time and they lay on the bed and david was reading by the light that came in the window on the left of the bed where he had pulled up one of the slatted curtains about a third of its length,hemingway
18169,18170,the light was reflected from the building across the street,the curtain was not pulled high enough to show the sky,hemingway
18171,18172,the colonel liked me being so dark catherine said,we must get to the sea again,hemingway
18173,18174,i have to keep it,we ll go there whenever you want,hemingway
18175,18176,that will be wonderful,can i tell you something,hemingway
18177,18178,i have to,what,hemingway
18179,18180,i did nt change back to be a girl for lunch,did i behave all right,hemingway
18181,18182,you did nt,no,hemingway
18183,18184,do you mind,but now i m your boy and i ll do anything for you,hemingway
18185,18186,david continued reading,are you angry,hemingway
18187,18188,no,sobered he thought,hemingway
18189,18190,it s simpler now,i do nt think so,hemingway
18191,18192,then i ll be careful,this morning everything i did felt so right and happy so clean and good in the daylight,hemingway
18193,18194,could nt i try now and we see,i d rather you did nt,hemingway
18195,18196,can i kiss you and try,not if you re a boy and i m a boy,hemingway
18197,18198,his chest felt as though there were an iron bar inside it from one side to the other,i wish you had nt told the colonel,hemingway
18199,18200,but he saw me david,he brought it up and he knew all about it and understood,hemingway
18201,18202,it was nt stupid to tell him,it was better,hemingway
18203,18204,he s our friend,if i told him he would nt talk,hemingway
18205,18206,if i did nt tell him he had a right to,you ca nt trust all people like that,hemingway
18207,18208,i do nt care about people,i only care about you,hemingway
18209,18210,i d never make scandals with other people,my chest feels like it is locked in iron,hemingway
18211,18212,i m sorry,mine feels so happy,hemingway
18213,18214,my dearest catherine,that s good,hemingway
18215,18216,you call me catherine always when you want,i am your catherine too,hemingway
18217,18218,i m always catherine when you need her,we d better go to sleep or should we start and see what happens,hemingway
18219,18220,let s first lie very quiet in the dark david said and lowered the latticed shade and they lay side by side on the bed in the big room in the palace in madrid where catherine had walked in the museo del prado in the light of day as a boy and now she would show the dark things in the light and there would it seemed to him be no end to the change,it was green and the trunks of the trees were dark and the distances were all new,hemingway
18221,18222,the lake was not where it had been and when they saw it through the trees it was quite changed,you walk ahead she said,hemingway
18223,18224,i want to look at you,so he turned away from her and walked to where there was a bench and sat down,hemingway
18225,18226,he could see a lake at a long distance and knew it was too far to ever walk to,he sat there on the bench and she sat down beside him and said it s all right,hemingway
18227,18228,but remorse had been there to meet him in the retiro and now it was so bad he told catherine that he would meet her at the cafe of the palace,are you all right,hemingway
18229,18230,do you want me to come with you,no,hemingway
18231,18232,i m all right,i just have to go,hemingway
18233,18234,i ll see you there she said,she looked particularly beautiful that morning and she smiled at their secret and he smiled at her and then took his remorse to the cafe,hemingway
18235,18236,he did not think he would make it but he did and later when catherine came he was finishing his second absinthe and the remorse was gone,how are you devil,hemingway
18237,18238,he said,i m your devil she said,hemingway
18239,18240,could i have one of those too,the waiter went away pleased to see her looking so handsome and so happy and she said what was it,hemingway
18241,18242,i just felt rotten but i feel fine now,was it that bad,hemingway
18243,18244,no he lied,she shook her head,hemingway
18245,18246,i m so sorry,i hoped there would nt be any bad at all,hemingway
18247,18248,it went away,that s good,hemingway
18249,18250,is nt it lovely to be here in the summer and no one here,i thought of something,hemingway
18251,18252,already,we can stay on and not go to the sea,hemingway
18253,18254,this is ours now,the town and here,hemingway
18255,18256,we could stay here and then drive back straight through to la napoule,there are nt many more moves to make,hemingway
18257,18258,do nt,we ve only just started,hemingway
18259,18260,we can always go back where we started,of course we can and we will,hemingway
18261,18262,let s not talk about it he said,he had felt it start to come back and he took a long sip of his drink,hemingway
18263,18264,it s a very strange thing he said,this drink tastes exactly like remorse,hemingway
18265,18266,it has the true taste of it and yet it takes it away,i do nt like you to have to take it for that,hemingway
18267,18268,we are nt like that,we must nt be,hemingway
18269,18270,maybe i am,you must nt be,hemingway
18271,18272,she took a long sip out of her glass and another long sip and looked around and then at him,i can do it,hemingway
18273,18274,look at me and watch it happen,here in the outdoor cafe of the palace in madrid and you can see the prado and the street and the sprinklers under the trees so it s real,hemingway
18275,18276,it s awfully brusque,but i can do it,hemingway
18277,18278,you can see,look,hemingway
18279,18280,the lips are your girl again and i m all the things you really want,have nt i done it,hemingway
18281,18282,tell me,you did nt have to,hemingway
18283,18284,do you like me as a girl she said very seriously and then smiled,yes he said,hemingway
18285,18286,that s good she said,i m glad someone likes it because it s a god damned bore,hemingway
18287,18288,do nt do it then,did nt you hear me say i did it,hemingway
18289,18290,did nt you watch me do it,do you want me to wrench myself around and tear myself in two because you ca nt make up your mind,hemingway
18291,18292,because you wo nt stay with anything,would you hold it down,hemingway
18293,18294,why should i hold it down,you want a girl do nt you,hemingway
18295,18296,do nt you want everything that goes with it,scenes hysteria false accusations temperament is nt that it,hemingway
18297,18298,i m holding it down,i wo nt make you uncomfortable in front of the waiter,hemingway
18299,18300,i wo nt make the waiter uncomfortable,i ll read my damned mail,hemingway
18301,18302,can we send up and get my mail,i ll go up and get it,hemingway
18303,18304,no,i should nt be here by myself,hemingway
18305,18306,that s right he said,you see,hemingway
18307,18308,that was why i said to send for it,they would nt give a botones the key to the room,hemingway
18309,18310,that was why i said i d go,i m over it catherine said,hemingway
18311,18312,i m not going to act that way,why should i act that way to you,hemingway
18313,18314,it was ludicrous and un dignified,it was so silly i wo nt even ask you to forgive me,hemingway
18315,18316,besides i have to go up to the room anyway,now,hemingway
18317,18318,because i m a god damned woman,i thought if i d be a girl and stay a girl i d have a baby at least,hemingway
18319,18320,not even that,that could be my fault,hemingway
18321,18322,do nt let s ever talk about faults,you stay here and i ll bring back the mail,hemingway
18323,18324,we ll read our mail and be nice good intelligent american tourists who are disappointed because they came to madrid at the wrong time of year,at lunch catherine said we ll go back to la napoule,hemingway
18325,18326,there is no one there and we ll be quiet and good and work and take care of each other,we can drive to aix too and see all the cezanne country,hemingway
18327,18328,we did nt stay there long enough before,we ll have a lovely time,hemingway
18329,18330,it is nt too soon for you to start to work again is it,no,hemingway
18331,18332,it would be good to start now,i m sure,hemingway
18333,18334,that will be wonderful and i ll study spanish really for when we come back,and i have so much i have to read,hemingway
18335,18336,we have lots to do,we ll do it too,hemingway
18337,18338,they had three rooms at the end of the long low rosecolored provencal house where they had stayed before,it was in the pines on the estérel side of la napoule,hemingway
18339,18340,out of the windows there was the sea and from the garden in front of the long house where they ate under the trees they could see the empty beaches the high papyrus grass at the delta of the small river and across the bay was the white curve of cannes with the hills and the far mountains behind,there was no one staying at the long house now in summer and the proprietor and his wife were pleased to have them back,hemingway
18341,18342,their bedroom was the big room at the end,it had windows on three sides and was cool that summer,hemingway
18343,18344,at night they smelled the pines and the sea,david worked in a room at the further end,hemingway
18345,18346,he started early each morning and when he was finished he would find catherine and they would go to a cove in the rocks where there was a sand beach to sun and to swim,sometimes catherine was gone with the car and he would wait for her and have a drink out on the terrace after his work,hemingway
18347,18348,it was impossible to drink pastis after absinthe and he had taken to drinking whiskey and perrier water,this pleased the proprietor who was now doing a good defensive summer business with the presence of the two bournes in the dead summer season,hemingway
18349,18350,he had not hired a cook and his wife was doing the cooking,one maid servant looked after the rooms and a nephew who was an apprentice waiter served at table,hemingway
18351,18352,catherine enjoyed driving the small car and went on buying and collecting trips to cannes and to nice,the big winter season shops were closed but she found extravagances to eat and solid values to drink and located the places where she could buy books and magazines,hemingway
18353,18354,david had worked very hard for four days,they had spent all the afternoon in the sun on the sand of a new cove they had found and they had been in the water until they were both tired and then come home in the evening with salt dried on their backs and in their hair to have a drink and take showers and change,hemingway
18355,18356,in bed the breeze came in from the sea,it was cool and they lay side by side in the dark with the sheet over them and catherine said you said i was to tell you,hemingway
18357,18358,i know,she leaned over him and held his head in her hands and kissed him,hemingway
18359,18360,i want to so much,can i,hemingway
18361,18362,may i,sure,hemingway
18363,18364,i m so happy,i ve made a lot of plans she said,hemingway
18365,18366,and this time i m not going to start so bad and wild,vhat sort of plans,hemingway
18367,18368,i can tell but it would be better to show it,we could do it tomorrow,hemingway
18369,18370,will you go in with me,where,hemingway
18371,18372,to cannes where i went when we were here before,he s a very good coiffeur,hemingway
18373,18374,we re friends and he s better than the one in biarritz because he understood right away,what have you been doing,hemingway
18375,18376,i went to see him this morning while you were working and i explained and he studied it and understood and thought it would be fine,i told him i had nt decided but that if i did i d try to get you to have yours cut the same way,hemingway
18377,18378,how is it cut,you ll see,hemingway
18379,18380,we ll go together,it s sort of bevelled back from the natural line,hemingway
18381,18382,he s very enthusiastic,i think it s because he s crazy about the bugatti,hemingway
18383,18384,are you afraid,i ca nt wait,hemingway
18385,18386,he wants to lighten it really but we were afraid you might not like it,the sun and the salt water lighten it,hemingway
18387,18388,this would be much fairer,he said he could make it as fair as scandinavian,hemingway
18389,18390,think how that would be with our dark skin,and we could make yours lighter too,hemingway
18391,18392,no,i d feel funny,hemingway
18393,18394,who do you know here that makes any difference,you d get lighter swimming all summer anyway,hemingway
18395,18396,he did not say anything and she said you wo nt have to,we ll just do mine and maybe you ll want to,hemingway
18397,18398,we can see,do nt make plans devil,hemingway
18399,18400,tomorrow i ll get up very early and work and you sleep as late as you can,then write for me too she said,hemingway
18401,18402,no matter if it s where i ve been bad put in how much i love you,i m nearly up to now,hemingway
18403,18404,can you publish it or would it be bad to,i ve only tried to write it,hemingway
18405,18406,can i ever read it,if i ever get it right,hemingway
18407,18408,david bourne woke when it was light and put on shorts and a shirt and went outside,the breeze had died,hemingway
18409,18410,the sea was calm and the day smelled of the dew and the pines,he walked bare footed across the flagstones of the terrace to the room at the far end of the long house and went in and sat down at the table where he worked,hemingway
18411,18412,the windows had been open overnight and the room was cool and full of early morning promise,he was writing about the road from madrid to zaragossa and the rising and falling of the road as they came at speed into the country of the red buttes and the little car on the then dusty road picked up the express train and catherine passed it gently car by car the tender and then the engineer and fireman and finally the nose of the engine and then she shifted as the road switched left and the train disappeared into a tunnel,hemingway
18413,18414,i had it she had said,but it went to ground,hemingway
18415,18416,tell me if i can get it again,he had looked at the michelin map and said not for a while,hemingway
18417,18418,i ll let it go then and we ll see the country,as the road climbed there were poplar trees along the river and the road climbed steeply and he felt the car accept it and then catherine shift again happily as it flattened the steep grade,hemingway
18419,18420,later when he heard her voice in the garden he stopped writing,he locked the suitcase with the cahiers of manuscript and went out locking the door after him,hemingway
18421,18422,the girl would use the pass key to clean the room,catherine was sitting at breakfast on the terrace,hemingway
18423,18424,there was a redandwhite checked cloth on the table,she wore her old grau du roi striped shirt freshwashed and shrunk now and much faded new gray flannel slacks and espadrilles,hemingway
18425,18426,hello she said,i could nt sleep late,hemingway
18427,18428,you look lovely,thank you,hemingway
18429,18430,i feel lovely,where did you get those slacks,hemingway
18431,18432,i had them made in nice,by a good tailor,hemingway
18433,18434,are they all right,they re very well cut,hemingway
18435,18436,they just look new,are you going to wear them into town,hemingway
18437,18438,not town,cannes in the off season,hemingway
18439,18440,everybody will next year,people are wearing our shirts now,hemingway
18441,18442,they re no good with skirts,you do nt mind do you,hemingway
18443,18444,not at all,they look right,hemingway
18445,18446,they just looked so well creased,after breakfast while david shaved and showered and then pulled on a pair of old flannels and a fisherman s shirt and found his espadrilles catherine put on a blue linen shirt with an open collar and a heavy white linen skirt,hemingway
18447,18448,we re better this way,even if the slacks are right for here they re too showoff for this morning,hemingway
18449,18450,we ll save them,it was very friendly and offhand at the coiffeur s but very professional,hemingway
18451,18452,monsieur jean who was about david s age and looked more italian than french said i will cut it as she asks,do you agree monsieur,hemingway
18453,18454,i do nt belong to the syndicate david said,i leave it to you two,hemingway
18455,18456,perhaps we should experiment on monsieur monsieur jean said,in case anything goes wrong,hemingway
18457,18458,but monsieur jean began cutting catherine s hair very carefully and skillfully and david watched her dark serious face above the smock that came close around her neck,she looked into the hand mirror and watched the comb and scissors lifting and snipping,hemingway
18459,18460,the man was working like a sculptor absorbed and serious,i thought about it all last night and this morning the coiffeur said,hemingway
18461,18462,if you do nt believe that monsieur i understand,but this is as important to me as your métier is to you,hemingway
18463,18464,he stepped back to look at the shape he was making,then he snipped more rapidly and finally turned the chair so the big mirror was reflected in the small one catherine held,hemingway
18465,18466,do you want it cut that way above the ears,she asked the coiffeur,hemingway
18467,18468,as you like,i can make it more degage if you wish,hemingway
18469,18470,but it will be beautiful as is if we are going to make it truly fair,i want it fair catherine said,hemingway
18471,18472,he smiled,madame and i have spoken of it,hemingway
18473,18474,but i said it must be monsieur s decision,monsieur gave his decision catherine said,hemingway
18475,18476,how fair did monsieur say he wished it to be,as fair as you can make it she said,hemingway
18477,18478,do nt say that monsieur jean said,you must tell me,hemingway
18479,18480,as fair as my pearls catherine said,you ve seen them plenty of times,hemingway
18481,18482,david had come over and was watching monsieur jean stir a large glassful of the shampoo with a wooden spoon,i have the shampoos made up with castile soap the coiffeur said,hemingway
18483,18484,it s warm,please come over here to the basin,hemingway
18485,18486,sit forward he said to catherine and put this cloth across your forehead,but it is nt even really a boy s haircut catherine said,hemingway
18487,18488,i wanted it the way we planned,everything s going wrong,hemingway
18489,18490,it could nt be more a boy s haircut,you must believe me,hemingway
18491,18492,he was lathering her head now with the foamy thick shampoo with the acrid odor,when her head had been shampooed and rinsed again and again it looked to david as though it had no color and the water tunnelled through it showing only a wet paleness,hemingway
18493,18494,the coiffeur put a towel over it and rubbed it softly,he was very sure about it,hemingway
18495,18496,do nt be desperate madame he said,why would i do anything against your beauty,hemingway
18497,18498,i am desperate and there is nt any beauty,he dried her head gently and then kept the towel over her head and brought a hand blower and began to play it through her hair as he combed it forward,hemingway
18499,18500,now watch he said,as the air drove through her hair it was turning from damp drab to a silvery northern shining fairness,hemingway
18501,18502,as the wind of the blower moved through it they watched it change,you should nt have despaired monsieur jean said not saying madame and then remembering,hemingway
18503,18504,madame wanted it fair,it s better than the pearls she said,hemingway
18505,18506,you re a great man and i was terrible,then he rubbed his hands together with something from a jar,hemingway
18507,18508,i ll just touch it with this he said,he smiled at catherine very happily and passed his hands lightly over her head,hemingway
18509,18510,catherine stood up and looked at herself very seriously in the mirror,her face had never been so dark and her hair was like the bark of a young white birch tree,hemingway
18511,18512,i like it so much she said,too much,hemingway
18513,18514,she looked in the mirror as though she had never seen the girl she was looking at,now we must do monsieur the coiffeur said,hemingway
18515,18516,does monsieur wish the cut,it s very conservative but it s also sportif,hemingway
18517,18518,the cut david said,i do nt think i ve had a haircut in a month,hemingway
18519,18520,please make it the same as mine catherine said,but shorter david said,hemingway
18521,18522,no,please just the same,hemingway
18523,18524,when it was cut david stood up and ran his hand over his head,it felt cool and comfortable,hemingway
18525,18526,are nt you going to let him lighten it,no,hemingway
18527,18528,we ve had enough miracles for one day,just a little,hemingway
18529,18530,david looked at catherine and then at his own face in the mirror,his was as brown as hers and it was her haircut,hemingway
18531,18532,you really want it that much,yes i do david,hemingway
18533,18534,truly,just to try it a little bit,hemingway
18535,18536,please,he looked once more in the mirror and walked over then and sat down,hemingway
18537,18538,the coiffeur looked at catherine,go ahead and do it she said,hemingway
18539,18540,he had not expected them back so soon and he was nearly asleep but he stood up and said the first thing that came in his head as they were opposite him,madame et monsieur ont fait décolorer les cheveux,hemingway
18541,18542,cest bien,merci monsieur,hemingway
18543,18544,on le fait toujours dans le mois daoût,cest bien,hemingway
18545,18546,cest trés bien,that s nice said catherine to david,hemingway
18547,18548,we re good clients,what the good client does is tres bien,hemingway
18549,18550,you re trés bien,my god you are,hemingway
18551,18552,in their room a good sailing breeze was blowing in from the sea and the room was cold,i love that blue shirt david said,hemingway
18553,18554,stand there like that in it,it s the color of the car she said,hemingway
18555,18556,would it look nicer without a skirt,everything on you looks nicer without a skirt he said,hemingway
18557,18558,i m going out and see that old goat and be an even better client,he came back with a bucket of ice and a bottle of the champagne that the proprietor had ordered for them and that they had drunk so seldom and he held two glasses on a small tray in his other hand,hemingway
18559,18560,this ought to be fair warning for them he said,we did nt need it catherine said,hemingway
18561,18562,we can just try it,it wo nt take fifteen minutes to cool,hemingway
18563,18564,do nt tease,please come to bed and let me see you and feel you,hemingway
18565,18566,she was taking his shirt up over his head and he stood up and helped her,after she was asleep david got up and looked at himself in the bathroom mirror,hemingway
18567,18568,he picked up a brush and brushed his hair,there was no other way to brush it but the way it had been cut,hemingway
18569,18570,it would disarrange and muss but it had to fall that way and the color was the same as catherine s,he went to the door and looked at her on the bed,hemingway
18571,18572,then he came back and picked up her big hand mirror,so that s how it is he said to himself,hemingway
18573,18574,you ve done that to your hair and had it cut the same as your girl s and how do you feel,he asked the mirror,hemingway
18575,18576,how do you feel,say it,hemingway
18577,18578,you like it he said,he looked at the mirror and it was someone else he saw but it was less strange now,hemingway
18579,18580,all right,you like it he said,hemingway
18581,18582,now go through with the rest of it whatever it is and do nt ever say anyone tempted you or that anyone bitched you,he looked at the face that was no longer strange to him at all but was his face now and said you like it,hemingway
18583,18584,remember that,keep that straight,hemingway
18585,18586,you know exactly how you look now and how you are,of course he did not know exactly how he was,hemingway
18587,18588,but he made an effort aided by what he had seen in the mirror,they ate dinner on the terrace in front of the long house that night and were very excited and quiet and enjoyed looking at each other in the shaded light on the table,hemingway
18589,18590,after dinner catherine said to the boy who had brought their coffee find the pail for the champagne in our room and ice a new bottle please,do we want another,hemingway
18591,18592,david asked,i think so,hemingway
18593,18594,do nt you,sure,hemingway
18595,18596,you do nt have to,do you want a fine,hemingway

18603,18604,we ll see about tonight,it s been such an arduous day,hemingway
18605,18606,in the night it was very dark and the wind had risen and they could hear it in the pines,david,hemingway
18607,18608,yes,how are you girl,hemingway
18609,18610,i m fine,let me feel your hair girl,hemingway

18615,18616,oh you have lovely lips,shut your eyes girl,hemingway
18617,18618,he did not shut his eyes but it was dark in the room and outside the wind was high in the trees,you know it is nt so easy to be a girl if you re really one,hemingway
18619,18620,if you really feel things,i know,hemingway
18621,18622,nobody knows,i tell you so when you re my girl,hemingway
18623,18624,it s not that you re insatiable,i m satiable so easily,hemingway
18625,18626,it s just some feel and others do nt,people lie about it i think,hemingway
18627,18628,but it s so nice just to feel and hold you,i m so happy,hemingway
18629,18630,just be my girl and love me the way i love you,love me more,hemingway
18631,18632,the way you can now,you now,hemingway
18633,18634,yes you,please you,hemingway
18635,18636,they were dropping down the slope toward cannes and the wind was heavy as they came onto the plain and skirted the deserted beaches the tall grass bending and flattening as they crossed the bridge over the river and picked up speed on the last stretch of fast road before the town,david found the bottle which was cold and wrapped in a towel and took a long drink and felt the car leave the work behind and move away and up the small rise the black road was making,hemingway
18637,18638,he had not worked this morning and now when she had driven them through the town and back into the country he uncorked the bottle and drank again and offered it to her,i do nt need it catherine said,hemingway
18639,18640,i feel too good,very well,hemingway
18641,18642,they passed golfejuan with the good bistro and the small open bar and then were through the pine woods and moving along the raw yellow beach of juanlespins,they crossed the small peninsula on the fast black road and passed through antibes driving beside the railway and then out through the town and beyond the port and the square tower of the old defenses and came out again into open country,hemingway
18643,18644,it never lasts she said,i always eat that stretch too fast,hemingway
18645,18646,they stopped and ate lunch in the lee of an old stone wall that was part of the ruin of some building hard by the side of a clear stream that came out of the mountains and crossed the wild plain on its way to the sea,the wind came hard out of a funnel in the mountains,hemingway
18647,18648,they had spread a blanket on the ground and they sat close together against the wall and looked out across the waste country to the sea that was flat and scoured by the wind,it was nt much of a place to come to catherine said,hemingway
18649,18650,i do nt know what i thought it would be like,they stood up and looked up at the hills with their poised villages and the gray and purple mountains behind,hemingway
18651,18652,the wind whipped in their hair and catherine pointed out a road that she had once driven into the high country,we could have gone somewhere up in there she said,hemingway
18653,18654,but it s so closed in and picturesque,i hate those hanging villages,hemingway
18655,18656,this is a good place david said,it s a fine stream and we could nt have a better wall,hemingway
18657,18658,you re being nice,you do nt have to be,hemingway
18659,18660,it s a good lee and i like the place,we ll turn our back on all the picturesque,hemingway
18661,18662,they ate stuffed eggs roast chicken pickles fresh long bread that they broke in pieces and spread sovora mustard on and they drank rosé,do you feel good now,hemingway
18663,18664,catherine asked,sure,hemingway
18665,18666,and you have nt felt bad,not even about anything i said,hemingway
18667,18668,david took a drink of the wine and said no,i have nt thought about it,hemingway
18669,18670,she stood up and looked into the wind so that it blew her sweater against her breasts and whipped her hair and then she looked down at him with her black brown face and smiled,she turned around then and looked out toward the sea that was flattened and wrinkled by the wind,hemingway
18671,18672,let s go get the papers in cannes and read them in the cafe she said,you want to show off,hemingway
18673,18674,why should nt i,it s the first time we ve been out together,hemingway
18675,18676,do you mind if we do,no devil,hemingway
18677,18678,why would i,i did nt want to if you did nt,hemingway
18679,18680,you said you wanted to,i want to do what you want,hemingway
18681,18682,i ca nt be more compliant than that can i,nobody wants you to be compliant,hemingway
18683,18684,can we stop it,all i wanted to be was good today,hemingway
18685,18686,why spoil everything,let s clean up here and go,hemingway
18687,18688,where,anywhere,hemingway
18689,18690,the god damn cafe,they bought the papers in cannes and a new french vogue the chasseur francais and the miroir des sports and sat at a table in front of the cafe out of the wind and read and had their drinks and were friends again,hemingway
18691,18692,david drank haig pinch bottle and perrier and catherine had armagnac and perrier,two girls who had driven up and parked on the street came over to the cafe and sat down and ordered a chambery cassis and a fine à leau,hemingway
18693,18694,it was the beauty of the two who took the brandy and soda,who are those two,hemingway
18695,18696,catherine said,do you know,hemingway
18697,18698,i ve never seen them,i have,hemingway
18699,18700,they must live around here somewhere,i saw them in nice,hemingway

18703,18704,they re sisters catherine said,they re both nice looking really,hemingway
18705,18706,but the one s a beauty,they re not americans,hemingway
18707,18708,the two girls were arguing and catherine said to david it s a big row i think,how did you know they were sisters,hemingway
18709,18710,i thought they were in nice,now i m not sure,hemingway
18711,18712,the car has swiss plates,it s an old isotta,hemingway
18713,18714,should we wait and see what happens,we have nt seen any drama for a long time,hemingway
18715,18716,i think it s just a big italian row,it must be getting serious because it s quieter,hemingway
18717,18718,it will flare up,the one is a damned handsome girl,hemingway
18719,18720,yes she is,and here she comes over,hemingway
18721,18722,david stood up,i m sorry the girl said in english,hemingway
18723,18724,please forgive me,please sit down she said to david,hemingway
18725,18726,will you sit down,catherine asked,hemingway
18727,18728,i should nt,my friend is furious with me,hemingway
18729,18730,but i told her you would understand,you will forgive me,hemingway
18731,18732,should we forgive her,catherine said to david,hemingway
18733,18734,let s forgive her,i knew you would understand the girl said,hemingway
18735,18736,it s only to tell me where you had your hair cut,she blushed,hemingway
18737,18738,or is it like copying a dress,my friend said it was more offensive,hemingway
18739,18740,i ll write it down for you catherine said,i m very ashamed the girl said,hemingway
18741,18742,you re not offended,of course not catherine said,hemingway
18743,18744,would you have a drink with us,i should nt,hemingway
18745,18746,may i ask my friend,she went back to her table for a moment and there was a short and vicious lowpitched exchange,hemingway
18747,18748,my friend regrets very much but she can not come over the girl said,but i hope we will meet again,hemingway
18749,18750,you have been so very kind,how about that,hemingway
18751,18752,catherine said when the girl had gone back to her friend,for on a windy day,hemingway
18753,18754,she ll be back to ask where you had your slacks cut,the row was still going on at the other table,hemingway
18755,18756,then the two of them stood up and came over,may i present my friend i am nina,hemingway
18757,18758,our name is bourne david said,how very pleasant of you to join us,hemingway
18759,18760,you were very nice to let us come over the handsome one said,it was an impudent thing to do,hemingway
18761,18762,she blushed,it s very flattering catherine said,hemingway
18763,18764,but he s a very good coiffeur,he must be the handsome one said,hemingway
18765,18766,she had a breathless way of speaking and she blushed again,we saw you in nice she said to catherine,hemingway
18767,18768,i wanted to speak to you then,i mean ask you,hemingway
18769,18770,she ca nt blush again david thought,but she did,hemingway
18771,18772,who s going to have their hair cut,catherine asked,hemingway
18773,18774,i am the handsome one said,i am too stupid nina said,hemingway
18775,18776,you said you were nt,i changed my mind,hemingway
18777,18778,i really am the handsome one said,we must go now,hemingway
18779,18780,do you come here to this cafe,sometimes catherine said,hemingway
18781,18782,i hope we ll see you sometime then the handsome one said,goodbye and thank you for being so gracious,hemingway
18783,18784,the two girls went to their table and nina called the waiter and they paid and were gone,they re not italian david said,hemingway
18785,18786,the one is nice but she could make you nervous blushing,she s in love with you,hemingway
18787,18788,sure,she saw me in nice,hemingway
18789,18790,well i ca nt help it if she is with me,it is nt the first girl that ever was and a lot of good it did them,hemingway
18791,18792,how about nina,that bitch catherine said,hemingway
18793,18794,she was a wolf,i suppose it should be amusing,hemingway
18795,18796,i did nt think it was amusing catherine said,i thought it was sad,hemingway
18797,18798,so did i,we ll find another cafe she said,hemingway
18799,18800,they re gone now anyway,they were spooky,hemingway
18801,18802,i know she said,for me too,hemingway
18803,18804,but the one girl was nice,she had beautiful eyes,hemingway
18805,18806,did you see,she was an awful blusher though,hemingway
18807,18808,i liked her,did nt you,hemingway
18809,18810,i suppose so,people that ca nt blush are worthless,hemingway
18811,18812,nina blushed once david said,i could be awfully rude to nina,hemingway
18813,18814,it would nt touch her,no,hemingway
18815,18816,she s well armored,do you want another drink before we go home,hemingway
18817,18818,i do nt need one,but you have one,hemingway
18819,18820,i do nt need one,have another,hemingway
18821,18822,you usually have two in the evening,i ll take a small one to keep company,hemingway
18823,18824,no,let s go home,hemingway
18825,18826,in the night he woke and heard the wind high and wild and turned and pulled the sheet over his shoulder and shut his eyes again,he felt her breathing and shut his eyes again,hemingway
18827,18828,he felt her breathing softly and regularly and then he went back to sleep,he left the ongoing narrative of their journey where it was to write a story that had come to him four or five days before and had been developing probably he thought in the last two nights while he had slept,hemingway
18829,18830,he knew it was bad to interrupt any work he was engaged in but he felt confident and sure of how well he was going and he thought he could leave the longer narrative and write the story which he believed he must write now or lose,the story started with no difficulty as a story does when it is ready to be written and he got past the middle of it and knew he should break off and leave it until the next day,hemingway
18831,18832,if he could not keep away from it after he had taken a break he would drive through and finish it,but he hoped he could keep away from it and hit it fresh the next day,hemingway
18833,18834,it was a good story and now he remembered how long he had intended to write it,the story had not come to him in the past few days,hemingway
18835,18836,his memory had been inaccurate in that,it was the necessity to write it that had come to him,hemingway
18837,18838,he knew how the story ended now,it was all true now because it happened to him as he wrote and only its bones were dead and scattered and behind him,hemingway
18839,18840,it started now with the evil in the shamba and he had to write it and he was very well into it,he was tired and happy from his work when he found catherine s note that she had not wanted to disturb him had gone out and would be back for lunch,hemingway
18841,18842,he left the room and ordered breakfast and as he waited for it monsieur aurol the proprietor came in and they spoke about the weather,monsieur aurol said the wind came this way sometimes,hemingway
18843,18844,it was not a true mistral the season guaranteed that but it would probably blow for three days,the weather was insane now,hemingway
18845,18846,monsieur had undoubtedly noticed that,if anyone kept track of it they would know that it had not been normal since the war,hemingway
18847,18848,david said he had not been able to keep track of it because he had been travelling but there was no doubt that the weather was strange,not only the weather said monsieur aurol everything was changed and what was not changed was changing fast,hemingway
18849,18850,it might very well all be for the best and he for one did not oppose it,monsieur as a man of the world probably saw it in the same way,hemingway
18851,18852,undoubtedly said david seeking for a decisive and terminal idiocy it was necessary to review the cadres,precisely said monsieur aurol,hemingway
18853,18854,they left it at that and david finished his café creme and read the miroir des sports and began to miss catherine,he went into the room and found far away and long ago and came out onto the terrace and settled himself in the sun by the table out of the wind to read the lovely book,hemingway
18855,18856,catherine had sent to galignani s in paris for the dent edition for a present for him and when the books had come they had made him feel truly rich,the figures in his bank balances the franc and dollar accounts had ever since grau du roi seemed completely unreal and he had never con sidered them as actual money,hemingway
18857,18858,but the books of w h hudson had made him feel rich and when he told catherine this she was very pleased,after he had read an hour he started to miss catherine very badly and he found the boy who served at table and asked him to bring a whiskey and perrier,hemingway
18859,18860,later he had another,it was well past lunch when he heard the car come up the hill,hemingway
18861,18862,they came along the walk and he heard their voices,they were excited and happy then the girl was suddenly silent and catherine said look who i brought to see you,hemingway
18863,18864,please i know i should not have come the girl said,it was the dark handsome one of the two they had met at the cafe yesterday the one who blushed,hemingway
18865,18866,how are you,david said,hemingway
18867,18868,she had evidently been to the coiffeur s and her hair had been cropped short the way catherine s had been at biarritz,i see you found the place,hemingway
18869,18870,the girl blushed and looked at catherine for courage,look at her catherine said,hemingway
18871,18872,go muss her head up,oh catherine the girl said,hemingway
18873,18874,then she said to david you can if you want,do nt be frightened he said,hemingway
18875,18876,what do you think you ve got into,i do nt know she said,hemingway
18877,18878,i m just so happy to be here,where have you two been,hemingway
18879,18880,david asked catherine,jean s of course,hemingway
18881,18882,then we just stopped and had a drink and i asked marita if she d come to lunch,are nt you glad to see us,hemingway
18883,18884,i m delighted,will you have another drink,hemingway
18885,18886,would you make martinis,catherine asked,hemingway
18887,18888,one wo nt hurt you she said to the girl,no please,hemingway
18889,18890,i have to drive,do you want a sherry,hemingway
18891,18892,no please,david went behind the bar and found glasses and some ice and made two martinis,hemingway
18893,18894,i ll taste yours if i may the girl said to him,you re not afraid of him now are you,hemingway
18895,18896,catherine asked her,not at all the girl said,hemingway
18897,18898,she blushed again,it tastes very good but terribly strong,hemingway
18899,18900,they are strong david said,but there s a strong wind today and we drink according to the wind,hemingway
18901,18902,oh said the girl,do all americans do that,hemingway
18903,18904,only the oldest families catherine said,us the morgans the woolworths the jelkses the jukeses,hemingway
18905,18906,you know,it s rugged in the blizzards and in hurricane months david said,hemingway
18907,18908,sometimes i wonder if we ll get through the autumnal equinox,i d like to have one sometime when i did nt have to drive the girl said,hemingway
18909,18910,you do nt have to drink because we do catherine said,and do nt mind that we make jokes all the time,hemingway
18911,18912,look at her david,are nt you glad i brought her,hemingway
18913,18914,i love it that you make jokes the girl said,you must forgive me that i m so happy to be here,hemingway
18915,18916,you were nice to come david said,when they were at lunch in the dining room out of the wind david asked what about your friend nina,hemingway
18917,18918,she s gone away,she was handsome david said,hemingway
18919,18920,yes,we had a very big fight and she went away,hemingway
18921,18922,she was a bitch catherine said,but then i think almost everyone is a bitch,hemingway
18923,18924,usually they are the girl said,i always hope not but they are,hemingway
18925,18926,i know plenty of women who are nt bitches david said,yes,hemingway
18927,18928,you would the girl said,was nina happy,hemingway
18929,18930,catherine asked,i hope she will be happy the girl said,hemingway
18931,18932,happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing i know,you have nt had such a long time to find out about it,hemingway
18933,18934,if you make mistakes you find out faster the girl said,you ve been happy all morning catherine said,hemingway
18935,18936,we had a wonderful time,you do nt need to tell me the girl said,hemingway
18937,18938,and i m happier now than i can remember ever,later over salad david asked the girl are you staying far from here along the coast,hemingway
18939,18940,i do nt think i m staying,really,hemingway
18941,18942,that s too bad he said and felt the tension come to the table and draw taut as a hawser,he looked from the girl with her eyelashes down so they touched her cheeks to catherine and she looked at him very straight and said she was going back to paris and i said why not stay here if aurol has a room,hemingway
18943,18944,come on up to lunch and see if david likes you and if you like the place,david do you like her,hemingway
18945,18946,it s not a club david said,it s a hotel,hemingway
18947,18948,catherine looked away and he moved fast to help her going on as though it had not been stated,we like you very much and i m sure aurol has room,hemingway
18949,18950,he should be delighted to have someone else here,the girl sat at the table with her eyes down,hemingway
18951,18952,i think i d better not,please stay a few days catherine said,hemingway
18953,18954,david and i would both love to have you,i ve no one here to keep me company while he works,hemingway
18955,18956,we d have good times the way we did this morning,tell her david,hemingway
18957,18958,the hell with her david thought,fuck her,hemingway
18959,18960,do nt be silly he said,call monsieur aurol please he told the boy who served,hemingway
18961,18962,we ll find out about a room,you wo nt mind truly,hemingway
18963,18964,the girl asked,we would nt have asked you if we minded david said,hemingway
18965,18966,we like you and you re very decorative,i ll be useful if i can the girl said,hemingway
18967,18968,i hope i ll find out how to be,be happy the way you were when you came in david told her,hemingway
18969,18970,that s useful,i am now the girl said,hemingway
18971,18972,i wish i d taken the martini now that i do nt have to drive,you can have one tonight catherine said,hemingway
18973,18974,that will be lovely,can we go and see the rooms now and get it over with,hemingway
18975,18976,david had driven her down to retrieve the big old isotta convertible and her bags from where the car had been parked in front of the cafe in cannes,on the way she said your wife is wonderful and i m in love with her,hemingway
18977,18978,she was sitting beside him and david did not look to see if she blushed,i m in love with her too he said,hemingway
18979,18980,i m in love with you also she said,is that all right,hemingway
18981,18982,he dropped his arm and closed his hand on her shoulder and she leaned close against him,we ll have to see about that he said,hemingway
18983,18984,i m glad i m smaller,smaller than who,hemingway
18985,18986,catherine she said,that s a hell of a thing to say he said,hemingway
18987,18988,i mean i thought you might like someone of my size,or do you only care for tall girls,hemingway
18989,18990,catherine s not a tall girl,of course not,hemingway
18991,18992,i only meant that i was not as tall,yes and you re very dark too,hemingway
18993,18994,yes,we ll look well together,hemingway
18995,18996,who will,catherine and i and you and i,hemingway
18997,18998,we ll have to,what does that mean,hemingway
18999,19000,i mean we ca nt escape looking well together can we if we look well and we are together,we re together now,hemingway
19001,19002,no,he was driving with only one hand on the wheel leaning back and looking up the road ahead at the juncture with the,hemingway
19003,19004,she had put her hand on him,we re just riding in the same car he said,hemingway
19005,19006,but i can feel that you like me,yes,hemingway
19007,19008,i m very reliable that way but it does nt mean a thing,it does mean something,hemingway
19009,19010,just what it says,it s a very nice thing to say she said and did not say anything more nor take her hand away until they had turned at the boulevard and pulled up behind the old isotta fraschini parked in front of the cafe under the old trees,hemingway
19011,19012,then she had smiled at him and got out of the small blue car,now at the hotel in the pines that were still being blown by the wind david and catherine were alone in their room after she finally came in from settling the girl in the two rooms that she had taken,hemingway
19013,19014,i think she ll be comfortable catherine said,of course the best room beside our own is the one at the far end where you work,hemingway
19015,19016,and i m going to keep it david said,i m going damn well and i wo nt change my work room for an imported bitch,hemingway
19017,19018,why are you being so violent,catherine said,hemingway
19019,19020,no one asked you to give it up,i just said it was the best,hemingway
19021,19022,but the two next door to it work out very well,who is this girl anyway,hemingway
19023,19024,do nt be so violent,she s a nice girl and i like her,hemingway
19025,19026,i know it was unforgivable to bring her up without speaking to you and i m sorry,but i did it and it s done,hemingway
19027,19028,i thought you d like to have someone pleasant and attractive for me to have as a friend to go around with while you re working,i do if you want someone,hemingway
19029,19030,i did nt want someone,i just ran into someone that i liked and thought you would like and it would be pleasant for her to be here for a little while,hemingway
19031,19032,but who is she,i have nt examined her papers,hemingway
19033,19034,you interrogate her if you need to,well she s decorative at least,hemingway
19035,19036,but whose girl is she,do nt be rough,hemingway
19037,19038,she s nobody s,tell me straight,hemingway
19039,19040,all right,she s in love with us both unless i m crazy,hemingway
19041,19042,you re not crazy,not yet maybe,hemingway
19043,19044,so what s the drill,i would nt know catherine said,hemingway
19045,19046,i would nt either,it s sort of strange and fun,hemingway
19047,19048,i would nt know david said,do you want to go to swim,hemingway
19049,19050,we missed it yesterday,let s swim,hemingway
19051,19052,should we ask her,it would only be polite,hemingway
19053,19054,we d have to wear suits,it would nt matter with this wind,hemingway
19055,19056,it s no day to be on the sand to tan,i hate to wear suits with you,hemingway
19057,19058,me too,but maybe tomorrow the wind will be over,hemingway
19059,19060,then on the estérel road with david driving the big old isotta feeling and condemning the too sudden brakes and finding how badly the motor needed to be worked over the three of them sat together and catherine said there are two or three different coves where we swim without suits when we re alone,that s the only way to get really dark,hemingway
19061,19062,it s not a good day to tan david said,it s too windy,hemingway
19063,19064,we can swim though without suits if you like catherine said to the girl,if david does nt mind,hemingway
19065,19066,it might be fun,i d love to the girl said,hemingway
19067,19068,do you mind,she asked david,hemingway
19069,19070,in the evening david made martinis and the girl said is everything always as wonderful as it has been today,it s been a pleasant day david said,hemingway
19071,19072,catherine had not yet come out from their room and he and the girl were sitting in front of the small bar m aurol had installed the previous winter in the corner of the big provencal room,when i drink i want to say things i should never say the girl said,hemingway
19073,19074,then do nt say them,then what s the use of drinking,hemingway
19075,19076,it is nt these,you ve only had one,hemingway
19077,19078,were you embarrassed when we swam,no,hemingway
19079,19080,should i have been,no she said,hemingway
19081,19082,i loved to see you,that s good he said,hemingway
19083,19084,how s the martini,it s very strong but i like it,hemingway
19085,19086,did you and catherine never swim before like that with anyone,no,hemingway
19087,19088,why should we,i ll get really brown,hemingway
19089,19090,i m sure you will,would you rather i was not so deeply brown,hemingway
19091,19092,you re a nice color,get that color all over if you like,hemingway
19093,19094,i thought perhaps you d like one of your girls lighter than the other,you re not my girl,hemingway
19095,19096,i am she said,i told you before,hemingway
19097,19098,you do nt blush anymore,i got over it when we went bathing,hemingway
19099,19100,i hope i wo nt now for a long time,that s why i said get over it,hemingway
19101,19102,that s why i told you,you look nice in that cashmere sweater david said,hemingway
19103,19104,catherine said we d both wear them,you do nt dislike me because i told you,hemingway
19105,19106,i forget what you told me,that i love you,hemingway
19107,19108,do nt talk rot,do nt you believe it happens to people like that,hemingway
19109,19110,the way it happened to me about you two,you do nt fall in love with two people at once,hemingway
19111,19112,you do nt know she said,it s rot he said,hemingway
19113,19114,it s just a way of talking,it is nt at all,hemingway
19115,19116,it s true,you just think it is,hemingway
19117,19118,it s nonsense,all right she said,hemingway
19119,19120,it s nonsense,but i m here,hemingway
19121,19122,yes,you re here he said,hemingway
19123,19124,he was watching catherine as she crossed the room smiling and happy,hello swimmers she said,hemingway
19125,19126,oh what a shame,i did nt get to see marita have her first martini,hemingway
19127,19128,this is still it the girl said,how did it affect her david,hemingway
19129,19130,made her talk rot,we ll start with a fresh one,hemingway
19131,19132,were nt you good to resuscitate this bar,it s such a sort of tentative bar,hemingway
19133,19134,we ll get a mirror for it,a bar s no good without a mirror,hemingway
19135,19136,we can get one tomorrow the girl said,i d like to get it,hemingway
19137,19138,do nt be rich catherine said,we ll both get it and then we can all see each other when we talk rot and know how rotty it is,hemingway
19139,19140,you ca nt fool a bar mirror,it s when i start looking quizzical in one that i know i ve lost david said,hemingway
19141,19142,you never lose,how can you lose with two girls,hemingway
19143,19144,catherine said,i tried to tell him the girl said and blushed for the first time that evening,hemingway
19145,19146,she s your girl and i m your girl catherine said,now stop being stuffy and be nice to your girls,hemingway
19147,19148,do nt you like the way they look,i m the very fair one you married,hemingway

19155,19156,it is nt a dark future is it,the girl asked,hemingway
19157,19158,very good catherine said,she s not only beautiful and rich and healthy and affectionate,hemingway
19159,19160,she can make jokes,are nt you pleased with what i brought you,hemingway

19163,19164,give her a kiss david and make her a fair present,david put his arm around the girl and kissed her and she started to kiss him and turned her head away,hemingway
19165,19166,then she was crying with her head down and both hands holding the bar,make a good joke now david said to catherine,hemingway
19167,19168,i m all right the girl said,do nt look at me,hemingway

19185,19186,yes,on the mouth,hemingway

19189,19190,i have nt criticized you,i m glad you did nt ask me to kiss her when we were at the beach,hemingway
19191,19192,i thought of it catherine said,she laughed and it was like the old days before anyone had mixed in their life,hemingway
19193,19194,did you think i was going to,i thought you were so i dove in,hemingway
19195,19196,good thing you did,they laughed again,hemingway
19197,19198,well we ve cheered up catherine said,thank god david said,hemingway
19199,19200,i love you devil and really i did nt kiss her to make all that,you do nt have to tell me catherine said,hemingway
19201,19202,i saw you,it was a miserable effort,hemingway
19203,19204,i wish she d go away,do nt be heartless catherine said,hemingway
19205,19206,and i did encourage her,i tried not i egged her on about you,hemingway
19207,19208,i ll go out and find her,no,hemingway
19209,19210,wait a little while,she s too sure of herself,hemingway
19211,19212,how can you say that david,you just broke her all up,hemingway
19213,19214,i did not,well something did,hemingway
19215,19216,i m going to go and get her,but it was nt necessary because the girl came back to the bar where they were standing and blushed and said i m sorry,hemingway
19217,19218,her face was washed and she had brushed her hair and she came up to david and kissed him on the mouth very quickly and said i like my present,did someone take my drink,hemingway
19219,19220,i threw it out catherine said,david will make a new one,hemingway
19221,19222,i hope you still like having two girls she said,because i am yours and i m going to be catherine s too,hemingway
19223,19224,i do nt go in for girls catherine said,it was very quiet and her voice did not sound right either to herself or to david,hemingway
19225,19226,do nt you ever,i never have,hemingway
19227,19228,i can be your girl if you ever want one and david s too,do nt you think that s sort of a vast undertaking,hemingway
19229,19230,catherine asked,that s why i came here the girl said,hemingway
19231,19232,i thought that was what you wanted,i ve never had a girl catherine said,hemingway
19233,19234,i m so stupid the girl said,i did nt know,hemingway
19235,19236,is it true,you re not making fun of me,hemingway
19237,19238,i m not making fun of you,i do nt know how i could be so stupid the girl said,hemingway
19239,19240,she means mistaken david thought and catherine thought it too,that night in bed catherine said i never should have let you in for any of it,hemingway
19241,19242,not for any part of it,i wish we d never seen her,hemingway
19243,19244,it might have been something worse,maybe to go through with it and get rid of it that way is best,hemingway
19245,19246,you could send her away,i do nt think that s the way to clear it now,hemingway
19247,19248,does nt she do anything to you,oh sure,hemingway
19249,19250,i knew she did,but i love you and all this is nothing,hemingway
19251,19252,you know it is too,i do nt know about it devil,hemingway
19253,19254,well we wo nt be solemn,i can already tell it s death if you re solemn,hemingway
19255,19256,he went on with the story living in it and nowhere else and when he heard the voices of the two girls outside he did not listen,when they went by the window he lifted his hand and waved,hemingway
19257,19258,they waved and the dark girl smiled and catherine put her fingers to her lips,the girl looked very pretty in the morning her face shining and her color high,hemingway
19259,19260,catherine was beautiful as always,he heard the car start and noted it was the bugatti,hemingway
19261,19262,he went back into the story,it was a good story and he finished it shortly before noon,hemingway
19263,19264,it was too late to have breakfast and he was tired after working and did not want to drive the old isotta into town with its bad brakes and huge malfunctioning motor although the key was with a note catherine had left saying they had gone to nice and would look in at the cafe for him on their way home,what i would like he thought is a tall cold liter of beer in a thick heavy glass and a pomme à lhuile with coarse ground peppercorns on it,hemingway
19265,19266,but the beer on this coast was worthless and he thought happily of paris and other places he had been and was pleased he had written something he knew was good and that he had finished it,this was the first writing he had finished since they were married,hemingway
19267,19268,finishing is what you have to do he thought,if you do nt finish nothing is worth a damn,hemingway
19269,19270,tomorrow i ll pick up the narrative where i left it and keep right on until i finish it,and how are you going to finish it,hemingway
19271,19272,how are you going to finish it now,as soon as he started to think beyond his work everything that he had locked out by the work came back to him,hemingway
19273,19274,he thought of the night before and of catherine and the girl today on the road that he and catherine had driven two days before and he felt sick,they should be on the way back now,hemingway
19275,19276,it s after noon,maybe they re at the cafe,hemingway
19277,19278,do nt be solemn she had said,but she meant something else too,hemingway
19279,19280,maybe she knows what she s doing,maybe she knows how it can turn out,hemingway
19281,19282,maybe she does know,you do nt,hemingway
19283,19284,so you worked and now you worry,you d better write another story,hemingway
19285,19286,write the hardest one there is to write that you know,go ahead and do that,hemingway
19287,19288,you have to last yourself if you re to be any good to her,what good have you been to her,hemingway
19289,19290,plenty he said,no not plenty,hemingway
19291,19292,plenty means enough,go ahead and start the new one tomorrow,hemingway
19293,19294,the hell with tomorrow,what a way to be,hemingway
19295,19296,tomorrow,go in and start it now,hemingway
19297,19298,he put the note and the key in his pocket and went back into the work room and sat down and wrote the first paragraph of the new story that he had always put off writing since he had known what a story was,he wrote it in simple declarative sentences with all of the problems ahead to be lived through and made to come alive,hemingway
19299,19300,the very beginning was written and all he had to do was go on,that s all he said,hemingway
19301,19302,you see how simple what you can not do is,then he came out onto the terrace and sat down and ordered a whiskey and perrier,hemingway
19303,19304,i worked too long,cest dommage the boy said,hemingway
19305,19306,can i bring anything,a sandwich,hemingway
19307,19308,in our storeroom you will find a tin of maquereau vin blanc capitaine cook,open it up and bring me two on a plate,hemingway
19309,19310,they wo nt be cold,it makes no difference,hemingway
19311,19312,bring them,he sat and ate the maquereau vin blanc and drank the whiskey and mineral water,hemingway
19313,19314,it did make a difference that they were not cold,he read the morning paper while he ate,hemingway
19315,19316,we always ate fresh fish at le grau du roi he thought but that was a long time ago,he started to remember grau du roi and then he heard the car coming up the hill,hemingway
19317,19318,take this away he said to the boy and he stood up and walked into the bar and poured himself a whiskey put ice in it and filled the glass with perrier,the taste of the winespiced fish was in his mouth and he picked up the bottle of mineral water and drank from it,hemingway
19319,19320,he heard their voices and then they came in the door as happy and gay as yesterday,he saw catherine s birch bright head and her dark face loving and excited and the other girl dark the wind still in her hair her eyes very bright and then suddenly shy again as she came closer,hemingway
19321,19322,we did nt stop when we saw you were nt at the cafe catherine said,i worked late,hemingway
19323,19324,how are you devil,i m very well,hemingway

19327,19328,the girl asked,that s being a good wife catherine said,hemingway
19329,19330,i forgot to ask,what did you do in nice,hemingway
19331,19332,can we have a drink and then tell,they were close to him on each side and he felt them both,hemingway
19333,19334,did you work well david,she asked again,hemingway
19335,19336,of course he did catherine said,that s the only way he ever works stupid,hemingway
19337,19338,did you david,yes he said and rumpled her head,hemingway
19339,19340,thanks,do nt we get a drink,hemingway
19341,19342,catherine asked,we did nt work at all,hemingway
19343,19344,we just bought things and ordered things and made scandal,we did nt make any real scandal,hemingway
19345,19346,i do nt know catherine said,i do nt care either,hemingway
19347,19348,what was the scandal,david asked,hemingway
19349,19350,it was nt anything the girl said,i did nt mind it catherine said,hemingway
19351,19352,i liked it,someone said something about her slacks in nice,hemingway
19353,19354,that s not a scandal david said,it s a big town,hemingway
19355,19356,you had to expect that if you went there,do i look any different,hemingway
19357,19358,catherine asked,i wish they d brought the mirror,hemingway
19359,19360,do i look any different to you,no,hemingway
19361,19362,david looked at her,she looked very blond and disheveled and darker than ever and very excited and defiant,hemingway
19363,19364,that s good she said,because i tried it,hemingway
19365,19366,you did nt do anything the girl said,i did and i liked it and i want another drink,hemingway
19367,19368,she did nt do anything david the girl said,this morning i stopped the car on the long clear stretch and kissed her and she kissed me and on the way back from nice too and when we got out of the car just now,hemingway
19369,19370,catherine looked at him lovingly but rebelliously and then said it was fun and i liked it,you kiss her too,hemingway
19371,19372,the boy s not here,david turned to the girl and she clung to him suddenly and they kissed,hemingway
19373,19374,he had not meant to kiss her and he had not known it would be like this when he did it,that s enough catherine said,hemingway
19375,19376,how are you,david said to the girl,hemingway
19377,19378,she was shy and happy again,i m happy the way you said to be the girl told him,hemingway
19379,19380,everybody is happy now catherine said,we ve shared all the guilt,hemingway
19381,19382,they had a very good lunch and drank cold tavel through the hors doeuvres the poulet and the ratatouille the salad and the fruit and cheese,they were all hungry and they made jokes and no one was solemn,hemingway
19383,19384,there s a terrific surprise for dinner or before catherine said,she spends money like a drunken oillease indian david,hemingway
19385,19386,are they nice,the girl asked,hemingway

19391,19392,no,some of his ancestors escaped from oklahoma and took him to east africa when he was very young,hemingway
19393,19394,it must have been very exciting,he wrote a novel about being in east africa when he was a boy,hemingway
19395,19396,i know,you read it,hemingway
19397,19398,david asked her,i did she said,hemingway

19413,19414,i was nt,when you kissed you asked me to,hemingway
19415,19416,what i wanted to say when you interrupted catherine said was did you think of him as a writer when you kissed him and liked it so much,david poured a glass of tavel and drank some of it,hemingway
19417,19418,i do nt know the girl said,i did nt think,hemingway
19419,19420,i m glad catherine said,i was afraid it was going to be like the clippings,hemingway

19425,19426,in the war,it s the only good thing anyone ever wrote about flying,hemingway
19427,19428,balls david said,wait until you read it catherine said,hemingway
19429,19430,it s a book you had to die to write and you had to be completely destroyed,do nt ever think i do nt know about his books just because i do nt think he s a writer when i kiss him,hemingway
19431,19432,i think we ought to take a siesta david said,you ought to take a nap devil,hemingway

19447,19448,catherine said,nothing that i do is important the girl said,hemingway
19449,19450,catherine and david lay side by side on the bed in their room with the wind blowing its last day outside and it was not like siesta in the old days,can i tell you now,hemingway
19451,19452,i d rather skip it,no let me tell,hemingway
19453,19454,this morning when i started the car i was frightened and i tried to drive very well and i felt hollow inside,then i could see cannes up ahead on the hill and the road was clear all up ahead by the sea and i looked behind and it was clear and i pulled out from the road into the brush,hemingway
19455,19456,where it s like the sagebrush,i kissed her and she kissed me and we sat in the car and i felt very strange and then we drove into nice and i do nt know whether people could tell it or not,hemingway
19457,19458,i did nt care by then and we went everywhere and bought everything,she loves to buy things,hemingway
19459,19460,someone made a rude remark but it was nothing really,then we stopped on the way home and she said it was better if i was her girl and i said i did nt care either way and really i was glad because i am a girl now anyway and i did nt know what to do,hemingway
19461,19462,i never felt so not knowing ever,but she s nice and she wanted to help me i think,hemingway
19463,19464,i do nt know,anyway she was nice and i was driving and she was so pretty and happy and she was just gentle the way we are sometimes or me to you or either of us and i said i could nt drive if she did that so we stopped,hemingway
19465,19466,i only kissed her but i know it happened with me,so we were there for a while and then i drove straight home,hemingway
19467,19468,i kissed her before we came in and we were happy and i liked it and i still like it,so now you ve done it david said carefully and you re through with it,hemingway

19529,19530,when she came back to the room david was not there and she stood a long time and looked at the bed and then went to the bathroom door and opened it and stood and looked in the long mirror,her face had no expression and she looked at herself from her head down to her feet with no expression on her face at all,hemingway
19531,19532,the light was nearly gone when she went into the bathroom and shut the door behind her,the wind had fallen and he left the car in the usual place and walked up the path to where the light came out onto the patio and the garden,hemingway
19533,19534,marita came out of the doorway and walked toward him,catherine feels terribly she said,hemingway
19535,19536,please be kind to her,the hell with both of you david said,hemingway

19593,19594,she drank the glass off and then held it looking at it and david was sure that she was going to throw it in his face,then she put it down and picked the garlic olive out of it and ate it very carefully and handed david the pit,hemingway
19595,19596,semiprecious stone she said,put it in your pocket,hemingway

19675,19676,no do nt bother i ll go,catherine went out the door and david watched her go,hemingway
19677,19678,her movements were less mechanical and her voice was better,when she came back she was smiling and her voice was almost natural,hemingway
19679,19680,she s coming in just a minute she said,she s lovely david,hemingway
19681,19682,i m so glad you brought her,the girl came in and david said we were waiting for you,hemingway
19683,19684,she looked at him and looked away,then she looked back at him and held herself very straight and said i m sorry to be late,hemingway
19685,19686,you look very handsome david said and it was quite true but she had the saddest eyes he had ever seen,make her a drink please david,hemingway
19687,19688,i had two catherine said to the girl,i m glad you feel better the girl said,hemingway
19689,19690,david made me feel good again catherine said,i told him all about everything and how lovely it was and he understands perfectly,hemingway
19691,19692,he really approves,the girl looked at david and he saw the way her teeth bit her upper lip and what she said to him with her eyes,hemingway
19693,19694,it was dull in town,i missed the swimming he said,hemingway
19695,19696,you do nt know what you missed catherine said,you missed everything,hemingway
19697,19698,it was what i wanted to do all my life and now i ve done it and i loved it,the girl was looking down at her glass,hemingway
19699,19700,the most wonderful thing is that i feel so grown up now,but it s exhausting,hemingway
19701,19702,of course it s what i wanted and now i ve done it and i know i m just an apprentice but i wo nt always be,apprentice allowance claimed david said and took a chance then and said very cheerfully do nt you ever talk on any other subjects,hemingway
19703,19704,perversion s dull and old fashioned,i did nt know people like us even kept up on it,hemingway
19705,19706,i suppose it s only really interesting the first time one does it catherine said,and then only to the person who does it and a bloody bore to everyone else david said,hemingway
19707,19708,do you agree heiress,do you call her heiress,hemingway
19709,19710,catherine asked,that s a nice funny name,hemingway
19711,19712,i ca nt very well call her maam or highness david said,do you agree heiress,hemingway
19713,19714,about perversion,i always thought it was overrated and silly she said,hemingway
19715,19716,it s only something girls do because they have nothing better,but one s first time at anything is interesting catherine said,hemingway
19717,19718,yes david said,but would you want to always talk about your first ride at steeplechase park or how you yourself person ally soloed alone all by yourself in a plane absolutely away from the earth and up in the sky,hemingway
19719,19720,i m ashamed catherine said,look at me and see if i m not ashamed,hemingway
19721,19722,david put his arm around her,do nt be ashamed he said,hemingway
19723,19724,just remember how you d like to hear old heiress here recall how she went up in that plane just herself and the plane and there was nothing between her and the earth imagine the earth with a big e but just her plane and they might have been killed and smashed to horrible bits both of them and she lose her money and her health and her sanity and her life with a capital l and her loved ones or me or you or jesus all with capital letters if she crashed put the word crashed in quotes,did you ever solo heiress,hemingway
19725,19726,no the girl said,i do nt have to now,hemingway
19727,19728,but i would like another drink,i love you david,hemingway
19729,19730,kiss her again the way you did before catherine said,sometime david said,hemingway
19731,19732,i m making drinks,i m so glad we re all friends again and everything is fine catherine said,hemingway
19733,19734,she was very animated now and her voice was natural and almost relaxed,i forgot about the surprise that heiress bought this morning,hemingway
19735,19736,i ll go and get it,when catherine was gone the girl took david s hand and held it very tight and then kissed it,hemingway
19737,19738,they sat and looked at each other,she touched his hand with her fingers almost absent mindedly,hemingway
19739,19740,she curled her fingers around his and then released them,we do nt need to talk she said,hemingway
19741,19742,you do nt want me to make a speech do you,no,hemingway
19743,19744,but we have to talk sometime,would you like me to go away,hemingway
19745,19746,you d be smarter to go away,would you kiss me so i know that it is all right if i stay,hemingway
19747,19748,catherine had come in now with the young waiter who carried a large tin of caviar in a bowl of ice on a tray with a plate of toast,that was a wonderful kiss she said,hemingway
19749,19750,everyone saw it so there s no longer any fear of scandal or anything catherine said,they re cutting up some egg whites and some onion,hemingway
19751,19752,it was very large firm gray caviar and catherine dipped it onto the pieces of thin toast,heiress bought you a case of bollinger brut and there is some iced,hemingway
19753,19754,do nt you think we should drink a bottle with this,sure said david,hemingway
19755,19756,let s have it all through the meal,is nt it lucky heiress and i are rich so you ll never have anything to worry about,hemingway
19757,19758,we ll take good care of him wo nt we heiress,we must try very hard the girl said,hemingway
19759,19760,i m trying to study his needs,this was all we could find for today,hemingway
19761,19762,he left her looking beautiful and young and unspoiled and then went into the bathroom and showered and put on a pair of shorts and walked barefoot through the garden to the room where he worked,he started in again on the new and difficult story and worked attacking each thing that for years he had put off facing,hemingway
19763,19764,he worked until nearly eleven oclock and when he had finished for the day he shut up the room and went out and found the two girls playing chess at a table in the garden,they both looked fresh and young and as attractive as the windwashed morning sky,hemingway
19765,19766,she s beating me again catherine said,how are you david,hemingway
19767,19768,the girl smiled at him very shyly,they are the two loveliest girls i ve ever seen david thought,hemingway
19769,19770,now what will this day bring,how are you two,hemingway
19771,19772,he said,we re very well the girl said,hemingway
19773,19774,did you have good luck,it s all uphill but it s going well he said,hemingway
19775,19776,you have nt had any breakfast,it s too late for breakfast david said,hemingway
19777,19778,nonsense catherine said,you re wife of the day heiress,hemingway
19779,19780,make him eat breakfast,would nt you like coffee and some fruit david,hemingway
19781,19782,the girl asked,you ought to eat something,hemingway
19783,19784,i ll have some black coffee david said,i ll bring you something the girl said and went off into the hotel,hemingway
19785,19786,david sat by catherine at the table and she put the chessmen and the board on a chair,she mussed his hair and said have you forgotten you have a silver head like mine,hemingway
19787,19788,yes he said,it s going to be lighter and lighter and i ll be fairer and fairer and darker in the body too,hemingway
19789,19790,that will be wonderful,yes and i m all over everything,hemingway
19791,19792,the pretty dark girl was bringing a tray with a small bowl rounded with caviar a half lemon a spoon and two pieces of toast and the young waiter had a bucket with a bottle of the bollinger and a tray with three glasses,this will be good for david the girl said,hemingway
19793,19794,then we can go swimming before lunch,after the swimming and lying in the sun on the beach and a big long lunch with more of the bollinger catherine said i m really tired and sleepy,hemingway
19795,19796,you swam a long way david said,we ll make a siesta,hemingway
19797,19798,i want to really sleep catherine said,do you feel well catherine,hemingway
19799,19800,the girl asked,yes,hemingway
19801,19802,just deadly sleepy,we ll put you to bed david said,hemingway
19803,19804,do you have a thermometer,he asked the girl,hemingway
19805,19806,i m sure i have nt any fever catherine said,i just want to sleep for a long time,hemingway
19807,19808,when she was in bed the girl brought in the thermometer and david took catherine s temperature and her pulse,the temperature was normal and the pulse was one hundred and five,hemingway
19809,19810,the pulse is a little high he said,but i do nt know your normal pulse,hemingway
19811,19812,i do nt either but it s probably too fast,i do nt think the pulse means much with the temperature normal david said,hemingway
19813,19814,but if you have a fever i ll bring a doctor up from cannes,i do nt want a doctor catherine said,hemingway
19815,19816,i just want to sleep,can i sleep now,hemingway
19817,19818,yes my beauty,you call if you want me,hemingway
19819,19820,they stood and watched her go to sleep and then went out very quietly and david walked along the stones and looked through the window,catherine was sleeping quietly and her breathing was regular,hemingway
19821,19822,he brought two chairs up and a table and they sat in the shade near catherine s window and looked out through the pines to the blue sea,what do you think,hemingway
19823,19824,david asked,i do nt know,hemingway
19825,19826,she was happy this morning,just as you saw her when you finished writing,hemingway
19827,19828,what about now,maybe just a reaction from yesterday,hemingway
19829,19830,she s a very natural girl david and this is natural,yesterday was like loving someone when someone s died he said,hemingway
19831,19832,it was nt right,catherine was sleeping in the same position and breathing lightly,hemingway
19833,19834,she s sleeping well he told the girl,would nt you like to take a nap,hemingway
19835,19836,i think so,i m going down to my room where i work he said,hemingway
19837,19838,there s a door to yours that bolts on each side,he walked down along the stones and unlocked the door of his room and then unbolted the door between the two rooms,hemingway
19839,19840,he stood and waited and then heard the bolt turn on the other side of the door and then the door opened,they sat side by side on the bed and he put his arm around her,hemingway
19841,19842,kiss me david said,i love to kiss you she said,hemingway
19843,19844,i love it so very much,but i ca nt do the other,hemingway
19845,19846,no,no i ca nt,hemingway
19847,19848,then she said is nt there anything i can do for you now,i m so ashamed about the other but you know how it could,hemingway
19849,19850,make trouble,just lie here by me,hemingway
19851,19852,i d love that,do what you like,hemingway
19853,19854,i will she said,you too please,hemingway
19855,19856,do what we can,catherine slept all through the afternoon and early evening,hemingway
19857,19858,david and the girl were sitting at the bar having a drink together and the girl said they never did bring the mirror,did you ask old man aurol about it,hemingway
19859,19860,yes,he was pleased,hemingway
19861,19862,i d better pay him corkage on that bollinger or something,i gave him four bottles and two very good bottles of fine,hemingway
19863,19864,he s taken care of,it was madame i was afraid of about trouble,hemingway
19865,19866,you were absolutely right,i do nt want to make trouble david,hemingway
19867,19868,no he said,i do nt think you do,hemingway
19869,19870,the young waiter had come in with more ice and david made two martinis and gave her one,the waiter put in the garlic olives and then went back to the kitchen,hemingway
19871,19872,i ll go and see how catherine is the girl said,things will turn out or they wo nt,hemingway
19873,19874,she was gone for about ten minutes and he felt of the girl s drink and decided to drink it before it got warm,he took it in his hand and raised it to his lips and he found as it touched his lips that it gave him pleasure because it was hers,hemingway
19875,19876,it was clear and undeniable,that s all you need he thought,hemingway
19877,19878,that s all you need to make things really perfect,be in love with both of them,hemingway
19879,19880,what s happened to you since last may,what are you anymore anyway,hemingway
19881,19882,but he touched the glass to his lips again and there was the same reaction as before,all right he said remember to do the work,hemingway
19883,19884,the work is what you have left,you better fork up with the work,hemingway
19885,19886,the girl came back and when he saw her come in her face happy he knew how he felt about her,she s getting dressed the girl said,hemingway
19887,19888,she feels fine,is nt it wonderful,hemingway
19889,19890,yes he said loving catherine too as always,what happened to my drink,hemingway
19891,19892,i drank it he said,because it was yours,hemingway
19893,19894,truly david,she blushed and was happy,hemingway
19895,19896,that s as well as i can put it he said,here s a new one,hemingway
19897,19898,she tasted it and passed her lips very lightly over the rim and then passed it to him and he did the same and took a long sip,you re very beautiful he said,hemingway
19899,19900,and i love you,he was completely detached from everything except the story he was writing and he was living in it as he built it,hemingway
19901,19902,the difficult parts he had dreaded he now faced one after another and as he did the people the country the days and the nights and the weather were all there as he wrote,he went on working and he felt as tired as if he had spent the night crossing the broken volcanic desert and the sun had caught him and the others with the dry gray lakes still ahead,hemingway
19903,19904,he could feel the weight of the heavy doublebarreled rifle carried over his shoulder his hand on the muzzle and he tasted the pebble in his mouth,across the shimmer of the dry lakes he could see the distant blue of the escarpment,hemingway
19905,19906,ahead of him there was no one and behind was the long line of porters who knew that they had reached this point three hours too late,it was not him of course who had stood there that morning nor had he even worn the patched corduroy jacket faded almost white now the armpits rotted through by sweat that he took off then and handed to his kamba servant and brother who shared with him the guilt and knowledge of the delay watching him smell the sour vinegary smell and shake his head in disgust and then grin as he swung the jacket over his black shoulder holding it by the sleeves as they started off across the drybaked gray the gun muzzles in their right hands the barrels balanced on their shoulders the heavy stocks pointing back toward the line of porters,hemingway
19907,19908,it was not him but as he wrote it was and when someone read it finally it would be whoever read it and what they found when they should reach the escarpment if they reached it and he would make them reach its base by noon of that day then whoever read it would find what there was there and have it always,all your father found he found for you too he thought the good the wonderful the bad the very bad the really very bad the truly bad and then the much worse,hemingway
19909,19910,it was a shame a man with such a talent for disaster and for delight should have gone the way he went he thought,it always made him happy to remember his father and he knew his father would have liked this story,hemingway
19911,19912,it was nearly noon when he came out of the room and walked barefoot on the stones of the patio to the entrance of the hotel,in the big room workmen were putting up a mirror on the wall behind the bar,hemingway
19913,19914,monsieur aurol and the young waiter were with them and he spoke to them and went out in the kitchen where he found madame,have you any beer madame,hemingway
19915,19916,he asked her,mais certainement monsieur bourne she said and brought a cold bottle from the ice chest,hemingway
19917,19918,i ll drink it from the bottle he said,as monsieur wishes she said,hemingway
19919,19920,the ladies drove to nice i believe,monsieur worked well,hemingway
19921,19922,very well,monsieur works too hard,hemingway
19923,19924,it s not good not to take breakfast,is there any of that caviar left in the tin,hemingway
19925,19926,i m sure there is,i ll take a couple of spoonsful,hemingway
19927,19928,monsieur is odd madame said,yesterday you ate it with champagne,hemingway
19929,19930,today with beer,i m alone today david said,hemingway
19931,19932,do you know if my bicyclette is still in the remise,it should be madame said,hemingway
19933,19934,david took a spoonful of the caviar and offered the tin to madame,have some madame,hemingway
19935,19936,it s very good,i should nt she said,hemingway
19937,19938,do nt be silly he told her,take some,hemingway
19939,19940,there s some toast,take a glass of champagne,hemingway
19941,19942,there s some in the ice box,madame took a spoonful of caviar and put it on a piece of toast left from breakfast and poured herself a glass of rose,hemingway
19943,19944,it is excellent she said,now we must put it away,hemingway
19945,19946,do you feel any good effect,david asked,hemingway
19947,19948,i m going to have one more spoon,ah monsieur,hemingway
19949,19950,you must nt joke like that,why not,hemingway
19951,19952,david said,my joking partners are away,hemingway
19953,19954,if those two beautiful women come back tell them i went for a swim will you,certainly,hemingway
19955,19956,the little one is a beauty,not as beautiful as madame of course,hemingway
19957,19958,i find her not too ugly david said,she s a beauty monsieur and very charming,hemingway
19959,19960,she ll do until something else comes along david said,if you think she s pretty,hemingway
19961,19962,monsieur she said in deepest reproof,what are all the architectural reforms,hemingway
19963,19964,david asked,the new miroir for the bar,hemingway
19965,19966,it s such a charming gift to the maison,everyone s full of charm david said,hemingway
19967,19968,charm and sturgeon eggs,ask the boy to look at my tires while i put something on my feet and find a cap will you please,hemingway
19969,19970,monsieur likes to go barefoot,me too in summer,hemingway
19971,19972,we ll go barefoot together sometime,monsieur she said giving it everything,hemingway
19973,19974,is aurol jealous,sans blague she said,hemingway
19975,19976,i ll tell the two beautiful ladies you ve gone swimming,keep the caviar away from aurol david said,hemingway
19977,19978,á bientôt chére madame,á tout á lheure monsieur,hemingway
19979,19980,on the shiny black road that mounted through the pines as he left the hotel he felt the pull in his arms and his shoulders and the rounding thrust of his feet against the pedals as he climbed in the hot sun with the smell of the pines and the light breeze that came from the sea,he bent his back forward and pulled lightly against his hands and felt the cadence that had been ragged as he first mounted begin to smooth out as he passed the hundredmeter stones and then the first redtopped kilometer marker and then the second,hemingway
19981,19982,at the headland the road dipped to border the sea and he braked and dismounted and put the bicycle over his shoulder and walked down with it along the trail to the beach,he propped it against a pine tree that gave off the resin smell of the hot day and he dropped down to the rocks stripped and put his espadrilles on his shorts shirt and cap and he dove from the rocks into the deep clear cold sea,hemingway
19983,19984,he came up through the varying light and when his head came out he shook it to clear his ears and then swam out to sea,he lay on his back and floated and watched the sky and the first white clouds that were coming with the breeze,hemingway
19985,19986,he swam back in to the cove finally and climbed up on the dark red rocks and sat there in the sun looking down into the sea,he was happy to be alone and to have finished his work for the day,hemingway
19987,19988,then the loneliness he always had after work started and he began to think about the girls and to miss them not to miss the one nor the other at first but to miss them both,then he thought of them not critically not as any problem of love or fondness nor of obligation nor of what had happened or would happen nor of any problem of conduct now or to come but simply of how he missed them,hemingway
19989,19990,he was lonely for them both alone and together and he wanted them both,sitting in the sun on the rock looking down into the sea he knew it was wrong to want them both but he did,hemingway
19991,19992,nothing with either of those two can end well and neither can you now he told himself,but do not start blaming who you love nor apportioning blame,hemingway
19993,19994,it will all be apportioned in due time and not by you,he looked down into the sea and tried to think clearly what the situation was and it did not work out,hemingway
19995,19996,the worst was what had happened to catherine,the next worse was that he had begun to care for the other girl,hemingway
19997,19998,he did not have to examine his conscience to know that he loved catherine nor that it was wrong to love two women and that no good could ever come of it,he did not yet know how terrible it could be,hemingway
19999,20000,he only knew that it had started,the three of you are already enmeshed like three gears that turn a wheel he told himself and also told himself one gear had been stripped or at least badly damaged,hemingway
20001,20002,he dove deep down into the clear cold water where he missed no one and then came up and shook his head and swam out further and then turned to swim back to the beach,he dressed still wet from the sea and put his cap in his pocket then climbed up to the road with his bicycle and mounted driving the machine up the short hill feeling the lack of training in his thighs as he pressed the balls of his feet on the pedals with the steady climbing thrust that carried him up the black road as though he and the racing bike were some wheeled animal,hemingway
20003,20004,then he coasted down his hands fingering the brakes taking the curves fast dropping down the shiny dark road through the pines to the turnoff at the back court of the hotel where the sea shone summer blue beyond the trees,the girls were not back yet and he went into the room and took a shower changed to a fresh shirt and shorts and came out to the bar with its new and handsome mirror,hemingway
20005,20006,he called the boy and asked him to bring a lemon a knife and some ice and showed him how to make a tom collins,then he sat on the bar stool and looked into the mirror as he lifted the tall drink,hemingway
20007,20008,i do not know if i d have a drink with you or not if i d met you four months ago he thought,the boy brought him the éclaireur de nice and he read it while he waited,hemingway
20009,20010,he had been disappointed not to find the girls returned and he missed them and began to worry,when they came in finally catherine was very gay and excited and the girl was contrite and very quiet,hemingway
20011,20012,hello darling catherine said to david,oh look at the mirror,hemingway
20013,20014,they did get it up,it s a very good one too,hemingway
20015,20016,it s awfully critical though,i ll go in and clean up for lunch,hemingway
20017,20018,i m sorry we re late,we stopped in town and had a drink the girl said to david,hemingway
20019,20020,i m sorry to have kept you waiting,a drink,hemingway
20021,20022,david said,the girl held up two fingers,hemingway
20023,20024,she put her face up and kissed him and was gone,david went back to reading the paper,hemingway
20025,20026,when catherine came out she was wearing the dark blue linen shirt that david liked and slacks and she said darling i hope you re not cross,it was nt really our fault,hemingway
20027,20028,i saw jean and i asked him to have a drink with us and he did and was so nice,the coiffeur,hemingway
20029,20030,jean,of course,hemingway
20031,20032,what other jean would i know in cannes,he was so nice and he asked about you,hemingway
20033,20034,can i have a martini darling,i ve only had one,hemingway
20035,20036,lunch must be ready by now,just one darling,hemingway
20037,20038,they only have us for lunch,david made two martinis taking his time and the girl came in,hemingway
20039,20040,she was wearing a white sharkskin dress and she looked fresh and cool,may i have one too david,hemingway
20041,20042,it was a very hot day,how was it here,hemingway
20043,20044,you should have stayed home and looked after him catherine said,i got along all right david said,hemingway
20045,20046,the sea was very good,you use such interesting adjectives catherine said,hemingway
20047,20048,they make everything so vivid,sorry david said,hemingway
20049,20050,that s another dandy word catherine said,explain what dandy means to your new girl,hemingway
20051,20052,it s an americanism,i think i know it the girl said,hemingway
20053,20054,it s the third word in yankee doodle dandy,do nt please be cross catherine,hemingway
20055,20056,i m not cross catherine said,but two days ago when you made passes at me it was simply dandy but today if i felt that way the slightest bit you had to act as though i was an i do nt know what,hemingway
20057,20058,i m sorry catherine the girl said,another sorry sorry catherine said,hemingway
20059,20060,as though you had nt taught me what little i know,should we have lunch,hemingway
20061,20062,david said,it s been a hot day devil and you re tired,hemingway
20063,20064,i m tired of everybody catherine said,please forgive me,hemingway
20065,20066,there s nothing to forgive the girl said,i m sorry i was stuffy,hemingway
20067,20068,i did nt come here to be that way,she walked over to catherine and kissed her very gently and lightly,hemingway
20069,20070,now be a good girl she said,should we go to the table,hemingway
20071,20072,did nt we have lunch,catherine asked,hemingway
20073,20074,no devil david said,we re going to have lunch now,hemingway
20075,20076,at the end of lunch catherine who had made sense through nearly all of it except for some absentmindedness said please excuse me but i think i ought to sleep,let me come with you and see you get to sleep the girl said,hemingway
20077,20078,actually i think i drank too much catherine said,i ll come in and take a nap too david said,hemingway
20079,20080,no please david,come in when i m asleep if you want catherine said,hemingway
20081,20082,in about half an hour the girl came out of the room she s all right she said,but we must be careful and good with her and only think about her,hemingway
20083,20084,in the room catherine was awake when david came in and he went over and sat on the bed,i m not a damned invalid she said,hemingway
20085,20086,i just drank too much,i know,hemingway
20087,20088,i m sorry i lied to you about it,how could i do that david,hemingway
20089,20090,you did nt remember,no,hemingway
20091,20092,i did it on purpose,will you take me back,hemingway
20093,20094,i m over all the bitchiness,you never were away,hemingway
20095,20096,if you take me back is all i want,i ll be your really true girl and really truly be,hemingway
20097,20098,would you like that,he kissed her,hemingway
20099,20100,really kiss me,oh she said,hemingway
20101,20102,please be slow,they swam at the cove where they had gone the first day,hemingway
20103,20104,david had planned to send the two girls to swim and then to take the old isotta down to cannes to have the brakes fixed and the ignition overhauled,but catherine had asked him to please swim with them and to do the car the next day and she seemed so happy and sound and cheerful again after her nap and marita had said very seriously will you please come,hemingway
20105,20106,so he had driven them to the turnout for the cove and shown them both on the way how dangerously the brakes were working,you d kill yourself with this car he told marita,hemingway
20107,20108,it s a crime to drive it the way it is,had i ought to get a new one,hemingway
20109,20110,she asked,christ no,hemingway
20111,20112,just let me fix the brakes to start with,we need a larger car with room for all of us catherine said,hemingway
20113,20114,this is a fine car david said,it just needs a hell of a lot of work done on it,hemingway
20115,20116,but it s too much car for you,you see if they can fix it properly the girl said,hemingway
20117,20118,if they ca nt we ll get the type of car you want,then they were tanning on the beach and david said lazily come in and swim,hemingway
20119,20120,pour some water on my head catherine said,i brought a sand bucket in the rucksack,hemingway
20121,20122,oh that feels wonderful she said,could i have one more,hemingway
20123,20124,pour it on my face too,she lay on the hard beach on her white robe in the sun and david and the girl swam out to sea and around the rocks at the mouth of the cove,hemingway
20125,20126,the girl was swimming ahead and david overhauled her,he reached out and grabbed a foot and then held her close in his arms and kissed her as they treaded water,hemingway
20127,20128,she felt slippery and strange in the water and they seemed the same height as they treaded water with their bodies close together and kissed,then her head went under and he leaned back and she came up laughing and shaking her head that was sleek as a seal and she brought her lips against his again and they kissed until they both went under,hemingway
20129,20130,they lay side by side and floated and touched and then kissed hard and happily and went under again,i do nt worry about anything now she said when they came up again,hemingway
20131,20132,you must nt either,i wo nt he said and they swam in,hemingway
20133,20134,you better go in devil he said to catherine,your head will get too hot,hemingway
20135,20136,all right,let s go in she said,hemingway
20137,20138,let heiress darken now,let me put some oil on her,hemingway
20139,20140,not too much the girl said,may i have a pail of water on my head too,hemingway
20141,20142,your head s as wet as it can get catherine said,i just wanted to feel it the girl said,hemingway
20143,20144,wade out david and get a good cold one catherine said,and after he had poured the clear cool sea water on marita s head they left her lying with her face on her arms and swam out to sea,hemingway
20145,20146,they floated easily like sea animals and catherine said would nt it be wonderful if i was nt crazy,you re not crazy,hemingway
20147,20148,not this afternoon she said,anyway not so far,hemingway
20149,20150,can we swim further,we re pretty well out devil,hemingway
20151,20152,all right,let s swim back in,hemingway
20153,20154,but the deep water s beautiful out here,do you want to swim down once before we go in,hemingway
20155,20156,just once she said,in this very deep part,hemingway
20157,20158,we ll swim down until we just can make it up,as he opened the door he felt again the touch of the air from the sea that promised how the day would be,hemingway
20159,20160,when he sat down the sun was not yet up and he felt that he had made up some of the time that was lost in the story,but as he reread his careful legible hand and the words took him away and into the other country he lost that advantage and was faced with the same problem and when the sun rose out of the sea it had for him risen long before and he was well into the crossing of the gray dried bitter lakes his boots now white with crusted alkalis,hemingway
20161,20162,he felt the weight of the sun on his head and his neck and his back,his shirt was wet and he felt the sweat go down his back and between his thighs,hemingway
20163,20164,when he stood straight up and rested breathing slowly and his shirt hung away from his shoulders he could feel it dry in the sun and see the white patches that the salts of his body made in the drying,he could feel and see himself standing there and knew there was nothing to do except go on,hemingway
20165,20166,at half past ten he had crossed the lakes and was well beyond them,by then he had reached the river and the great grove of fig trees where they would make their camp,hemingway
20167,20168,the bark of the trunks was green and yellow and the branches were heavy,baboons had been eating the wild figs and there were baboon droppings and broken figs on the ground,hemingway
20169,20170,the smell was foul,but the half past ten was on the watch on his wrist as he looked at it in the room where he sat at a table feeling the breeze from the sea now and the real time was evening and he was sitting against the yellow gray base of a tree with a glass of whiskey and water in his hand and the rolled figs swept away watching the porters butchering out the kongoni he had shot in the first grassy swale they passed before they came to the river,hemingway
20171,20172,i ll leave them with meat he thought and so it is a happy camp tonight no matter what comes after,so he put his pencils and the notebooks away and locked the suitcase and went out the door and walked on the stones dry and warm now to the hotel patio,hemingway
20173,20174,the girl was sitting at one of the tables reading a book,she wore a striped fisherman s shirt and tennis skirt and espadrilles and when she saw him she looked up and david thought she was going to blush but she seemed to check it and said good morning david,hemingway
20175,20176,did you work well,yes beauty he said,hemingway
20177,20178,she stood up then and kissed him good morning and said i m very happy then,catherine went in to cannes,hemingway
20179,20180,she said to tell you i was to take you swimming,did nt she want you to go in town with her,hemingway
20181,20182,no,she wanted me to stay,hemingway
20183,20184,she said you got up terribly early to work and maybe you d be lonely when you finished,can i order some breakfast,hemingway
20185,20186,you should nt always not eat breakfast,the girl went into the kitchen and she came out with oeufs au plat avec jambon and english mustard and sovora,hemingway
20187,20188,was it difficult today,she asked him,hemingway
20189,20190,no he said,it s always difficult but it s easy too,hemingway
20191,20192,it went very well,i wish i could help,hemingway
20193,20194,nobody can help he said,but i can help in other things ca nt i,hemingway
20195,20196,he started to say there are no other things but he did not say it and instead he said you have and you do,he wiped the last of the egg and mustard up from the shallow dish with a small piece of bread and then drank some tea,hemingway
20197,20198,how did you sleep,he asked,hemingway
20199,20200,very well the girl said,i hope that s not disloyal,hemingway
20201,20202,no,that s intelligent,hemingway
20203,20204,can we stop being so polite,the girl asked,hemingway
20205,20206,everything was so simple and fine until now,yes let s stop,hemingway
20207,20208,let s stop even the i ca nt david nonsense he said,all right she said and stood up,hemingway
20209,20210,if you want to go swimming i ll be in my room,he stood up,hemingway
20211,20212,please do nt go he said,i ve stopped being a shit,hemingway
20213,20214,do nt stop for me she said,oh david how could we ever get in a thing like this,hemingway
20215,20216,poor david,what women do to you,hemingway
20217,20218,she was stroking his head and smiling at him,i ll get the swimming things if you want to swim,hemingway
20219,20220,good he said,i ll go get my espadrilles,hemingway
20221,20222,they lay on the sand where david had spread the beach robes and the towels in the shade of a red rock and the girl said you go in and swim and then i will,he lifted very slowly and gently up out and away from her and then waded out from the beach and dove under where the water was cold and swam deep,hemingway
20223,20224,when he came up he swam out against the chop of the breeze and then swam in to where the girl was waiting for him standing up to her waist in the water her black head sleek and wet her light brown body dripping,he held her tight and the waves washed against them,hemingway
20225,20226,they kissed and she said everything of ours washed into the ocean,we have to get back,hemingway
20227,20228,let s go under once together holding tight,back at the hotel catherine had not arrived and after they had taken showers and changed david and marita sat at the bar with two martinis,hemingway
20229,20230,they looked at each other in the mirror,they watched each other very carefully and then david passed his finger under his nose while he looked at her and she blushed,hemingway
20231,20232,i want to have more things like that she said,things that only we have so i wo nt be jealous,hemingway
20233,20234,i would nt put out too many anchors he said,you might foul the cables,hemingway
20235,20236,no,i ll find things to do that will hold you,hemingway
20237,20238,that s a good practical heiress he said,i wish i could change that name,hemingway
20239,20240,do nt you,names go to the bone he said,hemingway
20241,20242,then let s really change mine she said,would you mind terribly,hemingway
20243,20244,no,haya,hemingway
20245,20246,say it again please,haya,hemingway
20247,20248,is it good,very good,hemingway
20249,20250,it s a small name between us,for nobody else ever,hemingway
20251,20252,what does haya mean,the one who blushes,hemingway
20253,20254,the modest one,he held her close and tight and she settled against him and her head was on his shoulder,hemingway
20255,20256,kiss me just once she said,catherine came into the big room dishevelled excited and full of accomplishment and gaiety,hemingway
20257,20258,you did take him swimming she said,you both do look handsome enough though still wet from the shower,hemingway
20259,20260,let me look at you,let me look at you the girl said,hemingway
20261,20262,what did you do to your hair,it s cendre catherine said,hemingway
20263,20264,do you like it,it s a rinse that jean s experimenting with,hemingway
20265,20266,it s beautiful the girl said,catherine s hair was strange and exalting against her dark face,hemingway
20267,20268,she picked up marita s drink and sipping it watched herself in the mirror and said did you have fun swimming,we both had a good swim the girl said,hemingway
20269,20270,but not as long as yesterday,this is such a good drink david catherine said,hemingway
20271,20272,what makes your martinis better than anyone else s,gin david said,hemingway

20277,20278,i m going to sleep after lunch,you did nt have to go through all the bleaching and rebleaching and all of it,hemingway
20279,20280,it s exhausting,what color is your hair really now,hemingway

20283,20284,you d like it,but i want to keep this so we see how it lasts,hemingway
20285,20286,how white is it,david asked,hemingway
20287,20288,about like the soap suds she said,do you remember,hemingway
20289,20290,that evening catherine was completely different from the way she had been at midday,she was sitting at the bar when they drove up from swimming,hemingway
20291,20292,the girl had stopped off at her room and when david came into the big main room he said what have you done to yourself now devil,i shampooed all that nonsense out she said,hemingway
20293,20294,it made gray stains on the pillow,she looked very striking her hair a very light almost toneless silver that made her face darker than it had ever looked,hemingway
20295,20296,you re too damned beautiful he said,but i wish they d never touched your hair,hemingway
20297,20298,it s too late for that now,can i tell you something else,hemingway
20299,20300,sure,tomorrow i m not going to have drinks and i m going to study spanish and read again and stop thinking only about myself,hemingway
20301,20302,my god david said,you had a big day,hemingway

20305,20306,put on your dark blue shirt will you,the one i got you like the one of mine,hemingway
20307,20308,david took his time in the shower and changing and when he came back the two girls were together at the bar and he wished he could have a painting of them,i told heiress everything about my new leaf catherine said,hemingway
20309,20310,the one i just turned over and how i want you to love her too and you can marry her too if she ll have you,we could in africa if i was registered mohammedan,hemingway
20311,20312,you re allowed three wives,i think it would be much nicer if we were all married catherine said,hemingway

20319,20320,david asked the dark girl,yes she said,hemingway
20321,20322,ask me,david looked at her,hemingway
20323,20324,she was very serious and excited,he thought of her face with her eyes closed against the sun and her black head against the whiteness of the towel robe on the yellow sand as it had been when they had made love at last,hemingway
20325,20326,i ll ask you he said,but not in any damned bar,hemingway
20327,20328,this is nt any damned bar catherine said,this is our own special bar and we bought the mirror,hemingway

20339,20340,the girl was looking down and david looked at catherine,i thought it all out this afternoon she said,hemingway
20341,20342,i really did,did nt i tell you marita,hemingway
20343,20344,she did the girl said,david saw that she was serious about this and that they had reached some understanding that he did not know about,hemingway
20345,20346,i m still your wife catherine said,we ll start with that,hemingway
20347,20348,i want marita to be your wife too to help me out and then she inherits from me,why does she have to inherit,hemingway
20349,20350,people make their wills she said,and this is more important than a will,hemingway
20351,20352,what about you,david asked the girl,hemingway
20353,20354,i want to do it if you want me to,good he said,hemingway
20355,20356,do you mind if i have a drink,you have one please catherine said,hemingway

20361,20362,i can tell,you d never find anybody else like her and i do nt want you to go to some damn bitch or be lonely,hemingway

20367,20368,you better get to work he told himself,you ca nt change any of it back,hemingway
20369,20370,only one person can change it back and she ca nt know how she will wake nor if she ll be there when she wakes,it does nt matter how you feel,hemingway
20371,20372,you better get to work,you have to make sense there,hemingway
20373,20374,you do nt make any in this other,nothing will help you,hemingway
20375,20376,nor would have ever since it started,when he finally got back into the story the sun was well up and he had forgotten the two girls,hemingway
20377,20378,it had been necessary to think what his father would have thought sitting that evening with his back against the greenyellow trunk of the fig tree with the enameled cup of whiskey and water in his hand,his father had dealt so lightly with evil giving it no chance ever and denying its importance so that it had no status and no shape nor dignity,hemingway
20379,20380,he treated evil like an old entrusted friend david thought and evil when she poxed him never knew she d scored,his father was not vulnerable he knew and unlike most people he had known only death could kill him,hemingway
20381,20382,he only wrote what his father did and how he felt and in all this he became his father and what his father said to mob was what he said,he slept well on the ground under the tree and he waked and heard the leopard cough,hemingway
20383,20384,later he did not hear the leopard in the camp but he knew he was there and he went back to sleep,the leopard was after meat and there was plenty of meat so there was no problem,hemingway
20385,20386,in the morning before daylight sitting by the ashes of the fire with his tea in the chipped enameled cup he asked mob if the leopard had taken meat and mob said ndiyo and he said there s plenty where we re going,get them moving so we can start the climb,hemingway
20387,20388,they were moving for the second day through the high wooded and parklike country above the escarpment when he stopped finally and he was happy with the country and the day and the distance they had made,he had his father s ability to forget now and not dread anything that was coming,hemingway
20389,20390,there was another day and another night ahead in that new high country when he stopped and he had lived two days and a night today,now that he left that country his father was with him still as he locked the door and walked back to the big room and the bar,hemingway
20391,20392,he told the boy he did not want breakfast and to bring him a whiskey and perrier and the morning paper,it was past noon and he had intended to drive the old isotta into cannes and see that the repairs were made but he knew the garages were closed now and it was too late,hemingway
20393,20394,instead he stood at the bar because that s where he would have found his father at that hour and having just come down from the high country he missed him,the sky outside was very much the sky that he had left,hemingway
20395,20396,it was high blue and the clouds white cumulus and he welcomed his father s presence at the bar until he glanced in the mirror and saw he was alone,he had intended to ask his father about two things,hemingway
20397,20398,his father who ran his life more disastrously than any man that he had ever known gave marvelous advice,he distilled it out of the bitter mash of all his previous mistakes with the freshening addition of the new mistakes he was about to make and he gave it with an accuracy and precision that carried the authority of a man who had heard all the more grisly provisions of his sentence and gave it no more importance than he had given to the fine print on a transatlantic steamship ticket,hemingway
20399,20400,he was sorry that his father had not stayed but he could hear the advice clearly enough and he smiled,his father would have given it more exactly but he david had stopped writing because he was tired and tired he could not do justice to his father s style,hemingway
20401,20402,no one could really and sometimes his father could not either,he knew now more than ever why he had always put off writing this story and he knew he must not think about it now that he had left it or he would damage his ability to write it,hemingway
20403,20404,you must not worry about it before you start nor when you stop he told himself,you re lucky to have it and do nt start fumbling with it now,hemingway
20405,20406,if you can not respect the way you handle your life then certainly respect your trade,you know about your trade at least,hemingway
20407,20408,but it was a rather awful story really,by god it was,hemingway
20409,20410,he sipped the whiskey and perrier again and looked out the door at the late summer day,he was cooling out as he always did and the giant killer made things better,hemingway
20411,20412,he wondered where the girls were,they were late again and he hoped that this time it would be nothing bad,hemingway
20413,20414,he was not a tragic character having his father and being a writer barred him from that and as he finished the whiskey and perrier he felt even less of one,he had never known a morning when he had not waked happily until the enormity of the day had touched him and he had accepted this day now as he had accepted all the others for himself,hemingway
20415,20416,he had lost the capacity of personal suffering or he thought he had and only could be hurt truly by what happened to others,he believed this wrongly of course since he did not know then how one s capacities can change nor how the other could change and it was a comfortable belief,hemingway
20417,20418,he thought of the two girls and wished that they would turn up,it was getting too late to swim before lunch but he wanted to see them,hemingway
20419,20420,he thought about them both,then he went into his and catherine s room and took a shower and shaved,hemingway
20421,20422,he was shaving when he heard the car come up and he felt the sudden empty feeling in his gut,then he heard their voices and heard them laughing and he found a fresh pair of shorts and a shirt and pulled them on and went out to see how things would be,hemingway
20423,20424,the three of them had quiet drinks and then a lunch that was good but light and they drank tavel and when they were eating cheese and fruit catherine said should i tell him,if you want the girl said,hemingway
20425,20426,she picked up her wine and drank part of it down,i forgot how to say it catherine said,hemingway
20427,20428,we waited too long,ca nt you remember it,hemingway
20429,20430,the girl said,no i ve forgotten it and it was wonderful,hemingway
20431,20432,we had it all worked out and it was really wonderful,david poured himself another glass of tavel,hemingway
20433,20434,do you want to try for just the factual content,he asked,hemingway
20435,20436,i know the factual content catherine said,it s that yesterday you made siesta with me and then you went to marita s room but today you can just go there,hemingway
20437,20438,but i ve spoiled it now and what i wish is we could all just make siesta together,not siesta david heard himself say,hemingway
20439,20440,i suppose not catherine said,well i m sorry i said it all wrong and i could nt help saying what i wished,hemingway
20441,20442,in the room he said to catherine to hell with her,no david,hemingway
20443,20444,she wanted to do what i asked her,maybe she can tell you,hemingway
20445,20446,fuck her,well you have she said,hemingway
20447,20448,that s not the point,go and talk with her david,hemingway
20449,20450,and if you want to fuck her then fuck her good for me,do nt talk rough,hemingway
20451,20452,you used it,i just knocked it back,hemingway
20453,20454,like tennis,all right david said,hemingway
20455,20456,what s she supposed to say to me,my speech catherine said,hemingway
20457,20458,the one i forgot,do nt look so serious or i wo nt let you go,hemingway
20459,20460,you re awfully appealing when you re serious,you d better go before she forgets the speech,hemingway
20461,20462,the hell with you too,that s good,hemingway
20463,20464,now you re reacting better,i like you when you are more careless,hemingway
20465,20466,kiss me goodbye,i mean good afternoon,hemingway
20467,20468,you really better go or she really will forget the speech,do nt you see how reasonable and good i am,hemingway
20469,20470,you re not reasonable and good,you like me though,hemingway
20471,20472,sure,do you want me to tell you a secret,hemingway
20473,20474,a new one,an old one,hemingway
20475,20476,all right,you are nt very hard to corrupt and you re an awful lot of fun to corrupt,hemingway
20477,20478,you ought to know,it was just a joke secret,hemingway
20479,20480,there is nt any corruption,we just have fun,hemingway
20481,20482,go on in and have her make my speech before she forgets it too,go on and be a good boy david,hemingway
20483,20484,in the room at the far end of the hotel david lay on the bed and said what s it all about really,it s just what she said last night the girl said,hemingway
20485,20486,she really means it,you do nt know how much she means it,hemingway
20487,20488,did you tell her we d made love,no,hemingway
20489,20490,she knew it,does it matter,hemingway
20491,20492,it did nt seem to,take a glass of wine david and be comfortable,hemingway
20493,20494,i m not indifferent she said,i hope you know that,hemingway
20495,20496,i m not either he said,then their lips were together and he felt her body against his and her breasts against his chest and her lips tight against his and then open her head moving from side to side and her breathing and the feel of his belt buckle against his belly and in his hands,hemingway
20497,20498,they lay on the beach and david watched the sky and the movement of the clouds and did not think at all,thinking did no good and when he lay down he had thought that if he did not think then everything that was wrong might go away,hemingway
20499,20500,the girls were talking but he did not listen to them,he lay and watched the september sky and when the girls had fallen silent he started to think and without looking at the girl he asked what are you thinking,hemingway
20501,20502,nothing she said,ask me catherine said,hemingway
20503,20504,i can guess what you re thinking,no you ca nt,hemingway
20505,20506,i was thinking about the prado,have you been there,hemingway
20507,20508,david asked the girl,not yet she said,hemingway
20509,20510,we ll go catherine said,when can we go david,hemingway
20511,20512,anytime david said,i want to finish this story first,hemingway
20513,20514,will you work hard on the story,that s what i m doing,hemingway
20515,20516,i ca nt work any harder,i did nt mean to hurry it,hemingway
20517,20518,i wo nt he said,if you re getting bored here you two go on ahead and i ll find you there,hemingway
20519,20520,i do nt want to do that marita said,do nt be silly catherine said,hemingway
20521,20522,he s just being noble,no,hemingway
20523,20524,you can go,it would nt be any fun without you catherine said,hemingway

20527,20528,he s working catherine marita said,he could work in spain catherine said,hemingway
20529,20530,plenty of spanish writers must have worked in spain,i ll bet i could write well in spain if i was a writer,hemingway
20531,20532,i can write in spain david said,when do you want to go,hemingway
20533,20534,damn you catherine marita said,he s in the middle of a story,hemingway
20535,20536,he s been writing for over six weeks catherine said,why ca nt we go to madrid,hemingway
20537,20538,i said we could david said,do nt you dare do that the girl said to catherine,hemingway
20539,20540,do nt you dare to try to do that,have nt you any conscience at all,hemingway
20541,20542,you re a fine one to talk about conscience catherine said,i have a conscience about some things,hemingway
20543,20544,that s fine,i m happy to know it,hemingway
20545,20546,now will you try to be polite and not interfere when someone is trying to work out what s best for everyone,i m going to swim david said,hemingway
20547,20548,the girl got up and followed him and outside the cove while they treaded water she said she s crazy,so do nt blame her,hemingway
20549,20550,but what are you going to do,finish the story and start another,hemingway
20551,20552,so what do you and i do,what we can,hemingway
20553,20554,he had in it all the pressure that had built while he was writing it and the modest part of him was afraid that it could not possibly be as good as he believed it to be,the cold hard part knew it was better,hemingway
20555,20556,how was it today,the girl asked him,hemingway
20557,20558,i finished,can i read it,hemingway
20559,20560,if you want you would nt mind truly,it s in those two cahiers in the top of the suitcase,hemingway
20561,20562,he handed her the key and then sat at the bar and drank a whiskey and perrier and read the morning paper,she came back and sat on a stool a little way down from him and read the story,hemingway
20563,20564,when she finished it she started to read it over again and he made himself a second whiskey and soda and watched her read,when she finished it the second time he said do you like it,hemingway
20565,20566,it s not a thing you like or not like she said,it s your father is nt it,hemingway
20567,20568,sure,was this when you stopped loving him,hemingway
20569,20570,no,i always loved him,hemingway
20571,20572,this was when i got to know him,it s a terrible story and it s wonderful,hemingway
20573,20574,i m glad you like it he said,i ll put it back now she said,hemingway
20575,20576,i like going in the room when the door is locked,we have that david said,hemingway
20577,20578,when they came back from the beach they found catherine in the garden,so you got back she said,hemingway
20579,20580,yes david said,we had a good swim,hemingway
20581,20582,i wish you d been there,well i was nt she said,hemingway
20583,20584,if it s of any interest to you,where did you go,hemingway
20585,20586,david asked,i was in cannes on my own business she said,hemingway
20587,20588,you re both late for lunch,i m sorry david said,hemingway
20589,20590,do you want to have anything before lunch,please excuse me catherine marita said,hemingway
20591,20592,i ll be back in a moment,you re still drinking before lunch,hemingway
20593,20594,catherine asked david,yes he said,hemingway
20595,20596,i do nt think it matters if you re getting a lot of exercise,i had two whiskeys actually,hemingway
20597,20598,actually she mimicked him,you re very british today,hemingway
20599,20600,really,he said,hemingway
20601,20602,i did nt feel very british,i felt sort of halfassed tahitian,hemingway
20603,20604,it s just your way of speaking that irritates me she said,your choice of words,hemingway
20605,20606,i see he said,did you want a shot before they bring the chow,hemingway
20607,20608,you do nt have to be a clown,the best clowns do nt talk he said,hemingway
20609,20610,nobody accused you of being the best of clowns she said,yes,hemingway
20611,20612,i d like a drink if it is nt too much work for you to make it,he made three martinis measuring them each out separately and pouring them into the pitcher where there was a big chunk of ice and then stirring,hemingway
20613,20614,who is the third drink for,marita,hemingway
20615,20616,your paramour,my what,hemingway
20617,20618,your paramour,you really said it david told her,hemingway
20619,20620,i d never heard that word pronounced and i had absolutely no hope of ever hearing it in this life,you re really wonderful,hemingway
20621,20622,it s a perfectly common word,it is at that david said,hemingway
20623,20624,but to have the sheer naked courage to use it in conversation,devil be good now,hemingway
20625,20626,could nt you say your dusky paramour,catherine looked away as she raised her glass,hemingway
20627,20628,and i used to find this type of banter amusing she said,do you want to try to be decent,hemingway
20629,20630,david asked,both of us decent,hemingway
20631,20632,no she said,here comes your whatever you call her looking sweet and innocent as ever,hemingway
20633,20634,i must say i m glad i had her before you did,dear me did david work before he started drinking today,hemingway
20635,20636,did you david,marita asked,hemingway
20637,20638,i finished a story david said,and i suppose marita s already read it,hemingway
20639,20640,yes i did,you know i ve never read a story of david s,hemingway
20641,20642,i never interfere,i ve only tried to make it economically possible for him to do the best work of which he is capable,hemingway
20643,20644,david took a sip of his drink and looked at her,she was the same wonderful dark and beautiful girl as ever and the ivory white hair was like a scar across her forehead,hemingway
20645,20646,only her eyes had changed and her lips that were saying things they were incapable of saying,i thought it was a very good story marita said,hemingway
20647,20648,it was strange and how do you say pastorale,then it became terrible in a way i could not explain,hemingway
20649,20650,i thought it was magnifique,catherine said,hemingway
20651,20652,we all speak french you know,you might have made the whole emotional outburst in french,hemingway
20653,20654,i was deeply moved by the story marita said,because david wrote it or because it really is first rate,hemingway
20655,20656,both the girl said,well catherine said is there any reason then why i ca nt read this extraordinary story,hemingway
20657,20658,i did put up the money for it,you did what,hemingway
20659,20660,david asked,perhaps not exactly,hemingway
20661,20662,you did have fifteen hundred dollars when you married me and that book about all the mad fliers has sold has nt it,you never tell me how much,hemingway
20663,20664,but i did put up a substantial sum and you must admit you ve lived more comfortably than you did before you married me,the girl did not say anything and david watched the waiter setting the table on the terrace,hemingway
20665,20666,he looked at his watch,it was about twenty minutes before the time they usually had lunch,hemingway
20667,20668,i d like to go in and clean up if i may he said,do nt be so bloody false polite catherine said,hemingway
20669,20670,why ca nt i read the story,it s just written in pencil,hemingway
20671,20672,it has nt even been copied,you would nt want to read it that way,hemingway
20673,20674,marita read it that way,read it after lunch then,hemingway
20675,20676,i want to read it now david,i really would nt read it before lunch,hemingway
20677,20678,is it disgusting,it s a story about africa back before the war,hemingway
20679,20680,in the time of the majimaji war,the native rebellion of in tanganyika,hemingway
20681,20682,i did nt know you wrote historical novels,i wish you d leave it alone david said,hemingway
20683,20684,it s a story that happens in africa when i was about eight years old,i want to read it,hemingway
20685,20686,david had gone to the far end of the bar and was shaking dice out of a leather cup,the girl sat on a stool next to catherine,hemingway
20687,20688,he watched her watching catherine as she read,it starts very well she said,hemingway
20689,20690,though your handwriting is atrocious,the country is superb,hemingway
20691,20692,the passage,what marita miscalled the pastorale part,hemingway
20693,20694,she put down the first notebook and the girl picked it up and held it on her lap her eyes still watching catherine,catherine read on and said nothing now,hemingway
20695,20696,she was halfway through the second part,then she tore the cahier in two and threw it on the floor,hemingway
20697,20698,it s horrible she said,it s bestial,hemingway
20699,20700,so that was what your father was like,no said david,hemingway
20701,20702,but that was one way he was,you did nt finish it,hemingway
20703,20704,nothing would make me finish it,i did nt want you to read it at all,hemingway
20705,20706,no,you both conspired to make me read it,hemingway
20707,20708,may i have the key david to lock it up,the girl asked,hemingway
20709,20710,she had retrieved the torn halves of the notebook from the floor,it was just ripped apart,hemingway
20711,20712,it was not torn across,david gave her his key,hemingway
20713,20714,it s even more horrible written in that child s notebook catherine said,you re a monster,hemingway
20715,20716,it was a very odd rebellion david said,you re a very odd person to write about it she said,hemingway
20717,20718,i asked you not to read the story,she was crying now,hemingway
20719,20720,i hate you she said,they were in their room in bed and it was late,hemingway
20721,20722,she ll go away and you ll have me shut up or put away catherine said,no,hemingway
20723,20724,that is nt true,but you suggested we go to switzerland,hemingway
20725,20726,if you were worried we could see a good doctor,the same way we d go to the dentist,hemingway
20727,20728,no,they d shut me up,hemingway
20729,20730,i know,everything that s innocent to us is crazy to them,hemingway
20731,20732,i know about those places,it s an easy drive and beautiful,hemingway
20733,20734,we d go by aix and st,remy and up the rhone from lyon to geneva,hemingway

20739,20740,i wo nt go,i wo nt go,hemingway
20741,20742,do you want me to scream,all right,hemingway
20743,20744,do nt think about it now,just try to sleep,hemingway
20745,20746,if i do nt have to go,we do nt have to,hemingway
20747,20748,i ll sleep then,are you going to work in the morning,hemingway
20749,20750,yes,i might as well,hemingway
20751,20752,you ll work well she said,i know you will,hemingway
20753,20754,good night david,you sleep well too,hemingway
20755,20756,he did not sleep for a long time,when he did he had dreams of africa,hemingway
20757,20758,they were good dreams until the one that woke him,he got up then and went direct from that dream to work,hemingway
20759,20760,he was well into the new story before the sun came up out of the sea and he did not look up from where he was to see how red the sun was,in the story he was waiting for the moon to rise and he felt his dog s hair rise under his hand as he stroked him to be quiet and they both watched and listened as the moon came up and gave them shadows,hemingway
20761,20762,his arm was around the dog s neck now and he could feel him shivering,all of the night sounds had stopped,hemingway
20763,20764,they did not hear the elephant and david did not see him until the dog turned his head and seemed to settle into david,then the elephant s shadow covered them and he moved past making no noise at all and they smelled him in the light wind that came down from the mountain,hemingway
20765,20766,he smelled strong but old and sour and when he was past david saw that the left tusk was so long it seemed to reach the ground,they waited but no other elephants came by and then david and the dog started off running in the moonlight,hemingway
20767,20768,the dog kept close behind him and when david stopped the dog pressed his muzzle into the back of his knee,david had to see the bull again and they came up on him at the edge of the forest,hemingway
20769,20770,he was travelling toward the mountain and slowly now moving into the steady night breeze,david came close enough to see him cut off the moon again and to smell the sour oldness but he could not see the right tusk,hemingway
20771,20772,he was afraid to work closer with the dog and he took him back with the wind and pushed him down against the base of a tree and tried to make him understand,he thought the dog would stay and he did but when david moved up toward the bulk of the elephant again he felt the wet muzzle against the hollow of his knee,hemingway
20773,20774,the two of them followed the elephant until he came to an opening in the trees,he stood there moving his huge ears,hemingway
20775,20776,his bulk was in the shadow but the moon would be on his head,david reached behind him and closed the dog s jaws gently with his hand and then moved softly and unbreathing to his right along the edge of the night breeze feeling it on his cheek edging with it never letting it get between him and the bulk until he could see the elephant s head and the great ears slowly moving,hemingway
20777,20778,the right tusk was as thick as his own thigh and it curved down almost to the ground,he and the dog moved back the wind on his neck now and they backtracked out of the forest and into the open park country,hemingway
20779,20780,the dog was ahead of him now and he stopped where david had left the two hunting spears by the trail when they had followed the elephant,he swung them over his shoulder in their thong and leather cup harness and with his best spear that he had kept with him all the time in his hand they started on the trail for the shamba,hemingway
20781,20782,the moon was high now and he wondered why there was no drumming from the shamba,something was strange if his father was there and there was no drumming,hemingway
20783,20784,she should nt go to madrid either,spain is a bad place to crack up,hemingway
20785,20786,i feel as though we d been married all our lives and never had anything but problems,she pushed his hair back from his forehead and kissed him,hemingway
20787,20788,do you want to swim now,yes,hemingway
20789,20790,let s dive from the high rock,the really high one,hemingway
20791,20792,you do she said,i ll swim out and you dive over my head,hemingway
20793,20794,all right,but hold still when i dive,hemingway
20795,20796,see how close you can come,looking up she watched him poised on the high rock arced brown against the blue sky,hemingway
20797,20798,then he came toward her and the water rose in a spout from a hole in the water behind her shoulder,he turned under water and came up in front of her and shook his head,hemingway
20799,20800,i cut it too fine he said,they swam out to the point and back and then wiped each other dry and dressed on the beach,hemingway
20801,20802,you really liked me diving that close,i loved it,hemingway
20803,20804,he kissed her and she felt cool and fresh from the swimming and she still tasted of the sea,catherine came in while they were still sitting at the bar,hemingway
20805,20806,she was tired and quiet and polite,at the table she said i went to nice and then drove the little corniche and i stopped up above villefranche and watched a battle cruiser come in and then it was late,hemingway
20807,20808,you were nt very late marita said,but it was very strange catherine said,hemingway
20809,20810,all the colors were too bright,even the grays were bright,hemingway
20811,20812,the olive trees were glittery,that s the noon light david said,hemingway
20813,20814,no,i do nt think so she said,hemingway
20815,20816,it was nt very nice and it was lovely when i stopped to watch the ship,she did nt look big to have such a big name,hemingway
20817,20818,please eat some of the steak david said,you ve eaten hardly anything,hemingway
20819,20820,i m sorry she said,it s good,hemingway
20821,20822,i like tournedos,would you like something instead of the meat,hemingway
20823,20824,no,i ll eat the salad,hemingway
20825,20826,do you think we could have a bottle of the perrierjouet,of course,hemingway
20827,20828,it was always such a nice wine she said,and we were always so happy with it,hemingway
20829,20830,afterward in their room catherine said do nt worry david please,it s just speeded up so much lately,hemingway
20831,20832,how,he asked,hemingway
20833,20834,he was stroking her forehead,i do nt know,hemingway
20835,20836,all of a sudden i was old this morning and it was nt even the right time of year,then the colors started to be false,hemingway
20837,20838,i worried and wanted to get you taken care of,you take wonderful care of everybody,hemingway
20839,20840,i m going to but i was so tired and there was nt any time and i knew it would be so humiliating if the money ran out and you had to borrow and i had nt fixed up anything nor signed anything and just been sloppy the way i ve been,then i worried about your dog,hemingway
20841,20842,my dog,yes your dog in africa in the story,hemingway
20843,20844,i went in the room to see if you needed anything and i read the story,while you and marita were talking in the other room,hemingway
20845,20846,i did nt listen,you left your keys in the shorts you changed from,hemingway
20847,20848,it s about half through he told her,it s wonderful she said,hemingway
20849,20850,but it frightens me,the elephant was so strange and your father too,hemingway
20851,20852,i never liked him but i like the dog better than anyone except you david and i m so worried about him,he was a wonderful dog,hemingway
20853,20854,you do nt have to worry about him,can i read about what happened to him today in the story,hemingway
20855,20856,sure if you want to,but he s at the shamba now and you do nt need to worry about him,hemingway
20857,20858,if he s all right i wo nt read it until you get back to him,kibo,hemingway
20859,20860,he had a lovely name,it s the name of a mountain,hemingway
20861,20862,the other part is mawenzi,you and kibo,hemingway
20863,20864,i love you so much,you were so much alike,hemingway
20865,20866,you re feeling better devil,probably catherine said,hemingway
20867,20868,i hope so,but it wo nt last,hemingway
20869,20870,driving this morning i was so very happy and then suddenly i was old so old i did nt care anymore,you re not old,hemingway
20871,20872,yes i am,i m older than my mother s old clothes and i wo nt outlive your dog,hemingway
20873,20874,not even in a story,he did not think it mattered that day because it was the exhaustion part of the story and so he had felt the tiredness as soon as they had picked up the trail again,hemingway
20875,20876,for a long time he had been fresher and in better shape than the two men and impatient with their slow trailing and the regular halts his father made each hour on the hour,he could have moved ahead much faster than juma and his father but when he started to tire they were the same as ever and at noon they took only the usual five minute rest and he had seen that juma was increasing the pace a little,hemingway
20877,20878,perhaps he was nt,perhaps it had only seemed faster but the dung was fresher now although it was not warm yet to the touch,hemingway
20879,20880,juma gave him the rifle to carry after they came on the last pile of dung but after an hour he looked at him and took it back,they had been climbing steadily across a slope of the mountain but now the trail went down and from a gap in the forest he saw the broken country ahead,hemingway
20881,20882,here s where the tough part starts davey his father said,it was then he knew that he should have been sent back to the shamba once he had put them on the trail,hemingway
20883,20884,juma had known it for a long time,his father knew it now and there was nothing to be done,hemingway
20885,20886,it was another of his mistakes and there was nothing to do now except gamble,david looked down at the big flattened circle of the print of the elephant foot and saw where the bracken had been pressed down and where a broken stem of a flowering weed was drying beyond the break,hemingway
20887,20888,juma picked it up and looked at the sun,juma handed the broken weed to david s father and his father rolled it in his fingers,hemingway
20889,20890,david noticed the white flowers that were drooped and drying,but they still had not dried in the sun nor shed their petals,hemingway
20891,20892,it s going to be a bitch his father said,let s get going,hemingway
20893,20894,late in the afternoon they were still tracking through the broken country,he had been sleepy now for a long time and as he watched the two men he knew that sleepiness was his real enemy and he followed their pace and tried to move through and out of the sleep that deadened him,hemingway
20895,20896,the two men relieved each other tracking on the hour and the one who was in second place looked back at him at regular intervals to check if he was with them,when they made a dry camp at dark in the forest again he went to sleep as soon as he sat down and woke with juma holding his moccasins and feeling his bare feet for blisters,hemingway
20897,20898,his father had spread his coat over him and was sitting by him with a piece of cold cooked meat and two biscuits,he offered him a water bottle with cold tea,hemingway
20899,20900,he ll have to feed davey his father said,your feet are in good shape,hemingway
20901,20902,they re as sound as juma s,eat this slowly and drink some tea and go to sleep again,hemingway
20903,20904,we have nt any problem,i m sorry i was so sleepy,hemingway
20905,20906,you and kibo hunted and travelled all last night,why should nt you be sleepy,hemingway
20907,20908,you can have a little more meat if you want it,i m not hungry,hemingway
20909,20910,good,we re good for three days,hemingway
20911,20912,we ll hit water again tomorrow,plenty of creeks come off the mountain,hemingway
20913,20914,where s he going,juma thinks he knows,hemingway
20915,20916,is nt it bad,not too bad davey,hemingway
20917,20918,i m going back to sleep david had said,i do nt need your coat,hemingway
20919,20920,juma and i are all right his father said,i always sleep warm you know,hemingway
20921,20922,david was asleep even before his father said good night,then he woke once with the moonlight on his face and he thought of the elephant with his great ears moving as he stood in the forest his head hung down with the weight of the tusks,hemingway
20923,20924,david thought then in the night that the hollow way he felt as he remembered him was from waking hungry,but it was not and he found that out in the next three days,hemingway
20925,20926,in the story he had tried to make the elephant come alive again as he and kibo had seen him in the night when the moon had risen,maybe i can david thought maybe i can,hemingway
20927,20928,but as he locked up the day s work and went out of the room and shut the door he told himself no you ca nt do it,the elephant was old and if it had not been your father it would have been someone else,hemingway
20929,20930,there is nothing you can do except try to write it the way that it was,so you must write each day better than you possibly can and use the sorrow that you have now to make you know how the early sorrow came,hemingway
20931,20932,and you must always remember the things you believed because if you know them they will be there in the writing and you wo nt betray them,the writing is the only progress you make,hemingway
20933,20934,he went behind the bar and found the bottle of haig and a cold half bottle of perrier and made himself a drink and took it out in the big kitchen to find madame,he told her he was going into cannes and would not be back for lunch,hemingway
20935,20936,she scolded him about drinking whiskey on an empty stomach and he asked her what she had cold that he could put in the empty stomach with the whiskey,she brought out some cold chicken and sliced it and put it on a plate and made an endive salad and he went into the bar and made another drink and came back to sit down at the kitchen table,hemingway
20937,20938,do nt drink that now before you eat monsieur madame said,it s good for me he told her,hemingway
20939,20940,we drank it at the mess like wine in the war,it s a wonder you were nt all drunkards,hemingway
20941,20942,like the french he said and they argued french working class drinking habits on which they both agreed and she teased him that his women had left him,he said that he was tired of them both and was nt she ready to take their place now,hemingway
20943,20944,no she said he would have to show more evidence he was a man before he roused a woman of the midi,he said he was going into cannes where he could get a proper meal and would come back like a lion and let the women of the south take care,hemingway
20945,20946,they kissed affectionately with the kiss of the favoured client and the brave femme and then david went in to take a shower to shave and to change,the shower made him feel good and he was cheered up from talking to madame,hemingway
20947,20948,i wonder what she would say if she knew what it was all about he thought,things had changed since the war and both monsieur and madame had a sense of style and they wished to move with the change,hemingway
20949,20950,we three clients are all de gens trés bien,so long as it pays and is nt violent there is nothing wrong with it,hemingway
20951,20952,the russians are gone the british are beginning to be poor the germans are ruined and now there is this disregard of the established rules which can very well be the salvation of the whole coast,we are pioneers in opening up the summer season which is still regarded as madness,hemingway
20953,20954,he looked at his face in the mirror with one side shaved,still he said to himself you do nt need to be such a pioneer as not to shave the other side,hemingway
20955,20956,and then he noted with careful critical distaste the almost silvery whiteness of his hair,he heard the bugatti come up the long slope and turn onto the gravel and stop,hemingway
20957,20958,catherine came into the room,she had a scarf over her head and sunglasses on and she took them off and kissed david,hemingway
20959,20960,he held her close and said how are you,not so good she said,hemingway
20961,20962,it was too hot,she smiled at him and put her forehead on his shoulder,hemingway
20963,20964,i m glad i m home,he went out and made a tom collins and brought it in to catherine who had finished a cold shower,hemingway
20965,20966,she took the tall cold glass and sipped from it and then held it against the smooth dark skin of her belly,she touched the glass to the tips of each of her breasts so they came erect and then took a long sip and held the cold glass against her belly again,hemingway
20967,20968,this is wonderful she said,he kissed her and she said oh that s nice,hemingway
20969,20970,i d forgotten about that,i do nt see any good reason why i should give that up,hemingway
20971,20972,do you,well i have nt she said,hemingway
20973,20974,i m not going to turn you over to someone else prematurely,that was a silly idea,hemingway
20975,20976,get dressed and come on out david said,no,hemingway
20977,20978,i want to have fun with you like in the old days,how,hemingway
20979,20980,you know,to make you happy,hemingway
20981,20982,how happy,this,hemingway
20983,20984,be careful he said,please,hemingway
20985,20986,all right if you want,the way it was in grau du roi the first time it ever happened,hemingway
20987,20988,if you want,it s just like grau du roi but it s lovelier because it s in the daytime and we love each other more because i d gone away,hemingway
20989,20990,are you really,yes if you want,hemingway
20991,20992,oh i want so much and you are and i have,please be slow and let me keep it,hemingway
20993,20994,you have it,yes i do,hemingway
20995,20996,i do have it,oh yes i do,hemingway
20997,20998,i do,please come now with me,hemingway
20999,21000,you he said,you did come back,hemingway
21001,21002,you never thought i would,yesterday it was all gone and everything was over and now here i am,hemingway
21003,21004,are you happy,yes,hemingway
21005,21006,do you remember when all i wanted was to be so dark and now i m the darkest white girl in the world,and the blondest,hemingway
21007,21008,you re just like ivory,that s how i always think,hemingway
21009,21010,you re smooth as ivory too,i m so happy and i want to have fun with you the way we always had,hemingway
21011,21012,but mine is mine,i m not going to turn you over to her the way i was doing and keep nothing,hemingway
21013,21014,that s over,it s not awfully clear david said,hemingway
21015,21016,but you really are fine again are nt you,i really am catherine said,hemingway
21017,21018,i m not gloomy or morbid or pitiful,you re nice and lovely,hemingway
21019,21020,it s all wonderful and changed,we re going to take turns catherine said,hemingway
21021,21022,you re mine today and tomorrow,and you re marita s the next two days,hemingway
21023,21024,my god i m hungry,this is the first time i ve been hungry in a week,hemingway
21025,21026,when david and catherine came back from swimming in the late afternoon they drove into cannes for the paris papers and then sat at the cafe and read and talked before they came home,after david had changed he found marita sitting at the bar reading,hemingway
21027,21028,he recognized the book as his own,the one she had not read,hemingway
21029,21030,did you have a good swim,she asked,hemingway
21031,21032,yes,we swam a long way out,hemingway
21033,21034,did you dive from the high rocks,i m glad of that she said,hemingway
21035,21036,how is catherine,more cheerful,hemingway
21037,21038,yes,she is very intelligent,hemingway
21039,21040,how are you,are you all right,hemingway
21041,21042,very well,i m reading this book,hemingway
21043,21044,how is it,i ca nt tell you till day after tomorrow,hemingway
21045,21046,i m reading very slowly to make it last,what s that,hemingway
21047,21048,the pact,i suppose so,hemingway
21049,21050,but i would nt worry very much about the book nor how i feel about you,it s not changed,hemingway
21051,21052,all right david said,but i missed you very badly this morning,hemingway
21053,21054,day after tomorrow she said,do nt worry,hemingway
21055,21056,for the first three hours he was fresher than they were and he asked juma for the rifle to carry but juma shook his head,he did not smile and he had always been david s best friend and had taught him to hunt,hemingway
21057,21058,he offered it to me yesterday david thought and i m in much better shape today than i was yesterday,he was too but by ten oclock he knew the day would be bad or worse than the day before,hemingway
21059,21060,it was as silly for him to think that he could trail with his father as to think he could fight with him,he knew too that it was not just that they were men,hemingway
21061,21062,they were professional hunters and he knew now that was why juma would not even waste a smile,they knew everything the elephant had done pointed out the signs of it to each other without speaking and when the tracking became difficult his father always yielded to juma,hemingway
21063,21064,when they stopped to fill the water bottles at a stream his father said just last the day out davey,then when they were finally past the broken country and climbing again toward the forest the tracks of the elephant turned off to the right onto an old elephant trail,hemingway
21065,21066,he saw his father and juma talking and when he got up to them juma was looking back over the way they had come and then at a far distant stony island of hills in the dry country and seemed to be taking a bearing of this against the peaks of three far blue hills on the horizon,juma knows where he s going now his father explained,hemingway
21067,21068,he thought he knew before but then he dropped down into this stuff,he looked back at the country they had come through all day,hemingway
21069,21070,where he s headed now is pretty good going but we ll have to climb,they had climbed until it was dark and then made another dry camp,hemingway
21071,21072,david had killed two spur fowl with his slingshot out of a small flock that had walked across the trail just before the sunset,the birds had come into the old elephant trail to dust walking neatly and plumply and when the pebble broke the back of one and the bird began to jerk and toss with its wings thumping another bird ran forward to peck at it and david pouched another pebble and pulled it back and sent it against the ribs of the second bird,hemingway
21073,21074,as he ran forward to put his hand on it the other birds whirred off,juma had looked back and smiled this time and david picked up the two birds warm and plump and smoothly feathered and knocked their heads against the handle of his hunting knife,hemingway
21075,21076,now where they were camped for the night his father said i ve never seen that type of francolin quite so high,you did very well to get a double on them,hemingway
21077,21078,juma cooked the birds spitted on a stick over the coals of a very small fire,his father drank a whiskey and water from the cup top of his flask as they lay and watched juma cook afterward juma gave them each a breast with the heart in it and ate the two necks and backs and the legs himself,hemingway
21079,21080,it makes a great difference davey his father said,we re very well off on rations now,hemingway
21081,21082,how far are we behind him,david asked,hemingway
21083,21084,we re quite close actually his father said,it all depends on whether he travels when the moon comes up,hemingway
21085,21086,it s an hour later tonight and two hours later than when you found him,why does juma think he knows where he s going,hemingway
21087,21088,he wounded him and killed his askari not too far from here,when,hemingway
21089,21090,five years ago he says,that may mean anytime,hemingway
21091,21092,when you were still a tow he says,has he been alone since then,hemingway
21093,21094,he says so,he has nt seen him,hemingway
21095,21096,only heard of him,how big does he say he is,hemingway
21097,21098,close to two hundred,bigger than anything i ve ever seen,hemingway
21099,21100,he says there s only been one greater elephant and he came from near here too,i d better get to sleep david said,hemingway
21101,21102,i hope i ll be better tomorrow,you were splendid today his father said,hemingway
21103,21104,i was very proud of you,so was juma,hemingway
21105,21106,in the night when he woke after the moon was up he was sure they were not proud of him except perhaps for his dexterity in killing the two birds,he had found the elephant at night and followed him to see that he had both of his tusks and then returned to find the two men and put them on the trail,hemingway
21107,21108,david knew they were proud of that,but once the deadly following started he was useless to them and a danger to their success just as kibo had been to him when he had gone up close to the elephant in the night and he knew they must each have hated themselves for not having sent him back when there was time,hemingway
21109,21110,the tusks of the elephant weighed two hundred pounds apiece,ever since these tusks had grown beyond their normal size the elephant had been hunted for them and now the three of them would kill him,hemingway
21111,21112,david was sure that they would kill him now because he david had lasted through the day and kept up after the pace had destroyed him by noon,so they probably were proud of him doing that,hemingway
21113,21114,but he had brought nothing useful to the hunt and they would have been far better off without him,many times during the day he had wished that he had never betrayed the elephant and in the afternoon he remembered wishing that he had never seen him,hemingway
21115,21116,awake in the moonlight he knew that was not true,all morning writing he had been trying to remember truly how he felt and what had happened on that day,hemingway
21117,21118,the hardest to make truly was how he had felt and keep it untinctured by how he had felt later,the details of the country were sharp and clear as the morning until the foreshortening and prolongation of exhaustion and he had written that well,hemingway
21119,21120,but his feeling about the elephant had been the hardest part and he knew he would have to get away from it and then come back to it to be certain it was as it had been not later but on that day,he knew the feeling had begun to form but he had been too exhausted to remember it exactly,hemingway
21121,21122,still involved in this problem and living in the story he locked up his suitcase and came out of the room onto the hagstones that led down to the terrace where marita was sitting in a chair under one of the pines facing out toward the sea,she was reading and as he was walking barefooted she did not hear him,hemingway
21123,21124,david looked at her and was pleased to see her,then he remembered the preposterous situation and turned into the hotel and walked to his and catherine s own room,hemingway
21125,21126,she was nt in the room and still feeling africa to be completely real and all of this where he was to be unreal and false he went out on the terrace to speak to marita,good morning he said,hemingway
21127,21128,have you seen catherine,she went off somewhere the girl said,hemingway
21129,21130,she said to tell you she d be back,suddenly it was not unreal at all,hemingway
21131,21132,you do nt know where she went,no the girl said,hemingway
21133,21134,she went off on her bike,my god david said,hemingway
21135,21136,she has nt ridden a bike since we bought the bug,that s what she said,hemingway
21137,21138,she s taking it up again,did you have a good morning,hemingway
21139,21140,i do nt know,i ll know tomorrow,hemingway
21141,21142,are you eating breakfast,i do nt know,hemingway
21143,21144,it s late,i wish you would,hemingway
21145,21146,i ll go in and get cleaned up he told her,he had taken a shower and was shaving when catherine came in,hemingway
21147,21148,she was wearing an old grau du roi shirt and short linen slacks chopped off below the knees and she was hot and her shirt was wet through,it s wonderful she said,hemingway
21149,21150,but i d forgotten what it does to your upper thighs when you climb,did you ride very far devil,hemingway
21151,21152,six kilometers she said,it was nothing but i d forgotten about the côtes,hemingway
21153,21154,it s awfully hot to ride now unless you go in the very early mornings david said,i m glad you started again though,hemingway
21155,21156,she was under the shower now and when she came out she said now see how dark we are together,we re just the way we planned,hemingway
21157,21158,you re darker,not much,hemingway
21159,21160,you re terribly dark too,look at us together,hemingway
21161,21162,they looked at each other standing touching in the long mirror on the door,oh you like us she said,hemingway
21163,21164,that s nice,so do i touch here and see,hemingway
21165,21166,she stood very straight and he put his hand on her breasts,i ll put on one of my tight shirts so you can tell what i think about things she said,hemingway
21167,21168,is nt it funny our hair has nt any color at all when it s wet,it s pale as seaweed,hemingway
21169,21170,she took a comb and combed her hair straight back so it looked as though she had just come out of the sea,i m going to wear mine this way now again she said,hemingway
21171,21172,like grau du roi and here in the spring,i like it across your forehead,hemingway
21173,21174,i m tired of that,but i can do it if you like,hemingway
21175,21176,do you think we could go into town and have breakfast at the cafe,have nt you had breakfast,hemingway
21177,21178,i wanted to wait for you,all right he said,hemingway
21179,21180,let s go in and get breakfast,i m hungry too,hemingway
21181,21182,they had a very good breakfast of café au lait brioche and strawberry jam and oeufs au plat avec jambon and when they were finished catherine asked would you come over with me to jean s,it s the day i go to get my hair washed and i m going to have it cut,hemingway
21183,21184,i ll wait here for you,would nt you please come,hemingway
21185,21186,you did it before and it was nt bad for anybody,no devil,hemingway
21187,21188,i did once but that was just once,like getting tattooed or something,hemingway
21189,21190,do nt ask me to,it does nt mean anything except to me,hemingway
21191,21192,i want us to be just the same,we ca nt be the same,hemingway
21193,21194,yes we could if you d let us,i really do nt want to do it,hemingway
21195,21196,not if i say it s all i want,why ca nt you want something that makes sense,hemingway
21197,21198,i do,but i want us to be the same and you almost are and it would nt be any trouble to do,hemingway
21199,21200,the sea s done all the work,then let the sea do it,hemingway
21201,21202,i want it for today,then you ll be happy i suppose,hemingway
21203,21204,i m happy now because you re going to do it and i ll stay happy,you love how i look,hemingway
21205,21206,you know you do,think of it that way,hemingway
21207,21208,it s silly,no it is nt,hemingway
21209,21210,not when it s you and you do it to please me,how badly will you feel if i do nt,hemingway
21211,21212,i do nt know,but very,hemingway
21213,21214,all right he said,it really means all that to you,hemingway
21215,21216,yes she said,oh thank you,hemingway
21217,21218,it wo nt take very long this time,i told jean we d be there and he s staying open for us,hemingway
21219,21220,are you always that confident i ll do things,i knew you would if you knew how much i wanted it,hemingway
21221,21222,i wanted very much not to,you should nt ask it,hemingway
21223,21224,you wo nt care,it s nothing and afterwards it will be fun,hemingway
21225,21226,do nt worry about marita,what about her,hemingway
21227,21228,she said that if you would nt do it for me to ask you if you d do it for her,do nt make things up,hemingway
21229,21230,no,she said it this morning,hemingway
21231,21232,i wish you could see yourself catherine said,i m glad i ca nt,hemingway
21233,21234,i wish you d looked in the glass,i could nt,hemingway
21235,21236,just look at me,that s how you are and i did it and there s nothing you can do now,hemingway
21237,21238,that s how you look,we could nt really have done that david said,hemingway
21239,21240,i could nt look the way you do,well we did catherine said,hemingway
21241,21242,and you do,so you better start to like it,hemingway
21243,21244,we ca nt have done that devil,yes we did,hemingway
21245,21246,you knew it too,you just would nt look,hemingway
21247,21248,and we re damned now,i was and now you are,hemingway
21249,21250,look at me and see how much you like it,david looked at her eyes that he loved and at her dark face and the incredibly flat ivory color of her hair and at how happy she looked and he began to realize what a completely stupid thing he had permitted,hemingway
21251,21252,but he knew that he must and finally he had started and they were following the spoor of the elephant on an old elephant trail that was a hard packed worn road through the forest,it looked as though elephants had travelled it ever since the lava had cooled from the mountain and the trees had first grown tall and close,hemingway
21253,21254,juma was very confident and they moved fast,both his father and juma seemed very sure of themselves and the going on the elephant road was so easy that juma gave him the to carry as they went on through the broken light of the forest,hemingway
21255,21256,then they lost the trail in smoking piles of fresh dung and the flat round prints of a herd of elephants that had come onto the elephant road from the heavy forest on the left of the trail,juma had taken the from david angrily,hemingway
21257,21258,it was afternoon before they had worked up to the herd and around it seeing the gray bulks through the trees and the movement of the big ears and the searching trunks coiling and uncoiling the crash of branches broken the crash of trees pushed over and the rumbling in the bellies of the elephants and the slap and thud of the dung falling,they had found the trail of the old bull finally and when it turned off onto a smaller elephant road juma had looked at david s father and grinned showing his filed teeth and his father had nodded his head,hemingway
21259,21260,they looked as though they had a dirty secret just as they had looked when he had found them that night at the shamba,it was not very long before they came on the secret,hemingway
21261,21262,it was off to the right in the forest and the tracks of the old bull led to it,it was a skull as high as david s chest and white from the sun and the rains,hemingway
21263,21264,there was a deep depression in the forehead and ridges ran from between the bare white eye sockets and flared out in empty broken holes where the tusks had been chopped away,juma pointed out where the great elephant they were trailing had stood while he looked down at the skull and where his trunk had moved it a little way from the place it had rested on the ground and where the points of his tusks had touched the ground beside it,hemingway
21265,21266,he showed david the single hole in the big depression in the white bone of forehead and then the four holes close together in the bone around the ear hole,he grinned at david and at his father and took a solid from his pocket and fitted the nose into the hole in the bone of the forehead,hemingway
21267,21268,here is where juma wounded the big bull his father said,this was his askari,hemingway
21269,21270,his friend really because he was a big bull too,he charged and juma knocked him down and finished him in the ear,hemingway
21271,21272,juma was pointing out the scattered bones and how the big bull had walked around among them,juma and david s father were both very pleased with what they had found,hemingway
21273,21274,how long do you suppose he and his friend had been together,david asked his father,hemingway
21275,21276,i have nt the faintest idea his father said,ask juma,hemingway
21277,21278,you ask him please,his father and juma spoke together and juma had looked at david and laughed,hemingway
21279,21280,probably four or five times your life he says david s father told him,he does nt know or care really,hemingway
21281,21282,i care david thought,i saw him in the moonlight and he was alone but i had kibo,hemingway
21283,21284,kibo has me too,the bull was nt doing anyone any harm and now we ve tracked him to where he came to see his dead friend and now we re going to kill him,hemingway
21285,21286,it s my fault,i betrayed him,hemingway
21287,21288,now juma had worked out the trail and motioned to his father and they started on,my father does nt need to kill elephants to live david thought,hemingway
21289,21290,juma would not have found him if i had not seen him,he had his chance at him and all he did was wound him and kill his friend,hemingway
21291,21292,kibo and i found him and i never should have told them and i should have kept him secret and had him always and let them stay drunk with their bibis at the beer shamba,juma was so drunk we could not wake him,hemingway
21293,21294,i m going to keep everything a secret always,i ll never tell them anything again,hemingway
21295,21296,if they kill him juma will drink his share of the ivory or just buy himself another god damn wife,why did nt you help the elephant when you could,hemingway
21297,21298,all you had to do was not go on the second day,no that would nt have stopped them,hemingway
21299,21300,juma would have gone on,you never should have told them,hemingway
21301,21302,never never tell them,try and remember that,hemingway
21303,21304,never tell anyone anything ever,never tell anyone anything again,hemingway
21305,21306,his father waited for him to come up and said very gently he rested here,he s not travelling as he was,hemingway
21307,21308,we ll be up on him anytime now,fuck elephant hunting david had said very quietly,hemingway
21309,21310,what s that,his father asked,hemingway
21311,21312,fuck elephant hunting david said softly,be careful you do nt fuck it up his father had said to him and looked at him flatly,hemingway
21313,21314,that s one thing david had thought,he s not stupid,hemingway
21315,21316,he knows all about it now and he will never trust me again,that s good,hemingway
21317,21318,i do nt want him to because i ll never ever tell him or anybody anything again never anything again,never ever never,hemingway
21319,21320,that was where he stopped in the hunt that morning,he knew he did not have it right yet,hemingway
21321,21322,he had not gotten the enormity of the skull as they had come onto it in the forest nor the tunnels underneath it in the earth that the beetles had made and that had been revealed like deserted galleries or catacombs when the elephant had moved the skull,he had not made the great length of the whitened bones nor how the elephant s tracks had moved around the scene of the killing and how following them he had been able to see the elephant as he had moved and then had been able to see what the elephant had seen,hemingway
21323,21324,he had not gotten the great width of the one elephant trail that was a perfect road through the forest nor the worn smooth rubbing trees nor the way other trails intersected so that they were like the map of the metro in paris,he had not made the light in the forest where the trees came together at their tops and he had not clarified certain things that he must make as they were then not as he recalled them now,hemingway
21325,21326,the distances did not matter since all distances changed and how you remembered them was how they were,but his change of feeling toward juma and toward his father and toward the elephant was complicated by the exhaustion that had bred it,hemingway
21327,21328,tiredness brought the beginning of understanding,the understanding was beginning and he was realizing it as he wrote,hemingway
21329,21330,but the dreadful true understanding was all to come and he must not show it by arbitrary statements of rhetoric but by remembering the actual things that had brought it,tomorrow he would get the things right and then go on,hemingway
21331,21332,he put the cahiers of manuscript away in the suitcase and locked it and came out the door of his room and walked along the front of the hotel to where marita was reading,do you want breakfast,hemingway
21333,21334,she asked,i think i d like a drink,hemingway
21335,21336,let s have it at the bar she said,it s cooler,hemingway
21337,21338,they went in and sat down on stools and david poured from the haig pinch bottle into a glass and filled it up with cold perrier,what became of catherine,hemingway
21339,21340,she left very happy and gay,and how are you,hemingway
21341,21342,happy and shy and rather quiet,too shy for me to kiss you,hemingway
21343,21344,they held each other and he could feel himself start to be whole again,he had not known just how greatly he had been divided and separated because once he started to work he wrote from an inner core which could not be split nor even marked nor scratched,hemingway
21345,21346,he knew about this and it was his strength since all the rest of him could be riven,they sat at the bar while the boy laid the table and the first coolness of fall was in the breeze from the sea and then sitting at the table under the pines they felt it again as they ate and drank,hemingway
21347,21348,this cool breeze comes all the way from kurdistan david said,the equinoctial storms will be coming soon,hemingway
21349,21350,they wo nt come today the girl said,we do nt have to worry about them today,hemingway
21351,21352,there has nt been a blow of any kind since when we met in cannes at the cafe,can you still remember things that long ago,hemingway
21353,21354,it seems further away than the war,i had the war the last three days the girl said,hemingway
21355,21356,i just left it this morning,i never think about it david said,hemingway
21357,21358,now i ve read it marita told him but i do nt understand about you,you never made clear what you believed,hemingway
21359,21360,he filled her glass and then refilled his own,i did nt know until afterwards he said,hemingway
21361,21362,so i did nt try to act as though i did,i suspended thinking about it while it was happening,hemingway
21363,21364,i only felt and saw and acted and thought tactically,that s why it s not a better book,hemingway
21365,21366,because i was nt more intelligent,it is a very good book,hemingway
21367,21368,the flying parts are wonderful and the feeling for the other people and for the planes themselves,i m good on other people and on technical and tactical things david said,hemingway
21369,21370,i do nt mean to talk wet or to brag,but marita nobody knows about himself when he is really involved,hemingway
21371,21372,yourself is nt worth considering,it would be shameful at the time,hemingway
21373,21374,but afterwards you know,sure,hemingway
21375,21376,sometimes,can i read the narrative,hemingway
21377,21378,david poured wine in the glasses again,how much did she tell you,hemingway
21379,21380,she said she told me everything,she tells things very well you know,hemingway
21381,21382,i d rather you did nt read it david said,all it would do is make trouble,hemingway
21383,21384,i did nt know there would be you when i wrote it and i ca nt help her telling you things but i do nt have to have you read about them too,then i must nt read it,hemingway
21385,21386,i wish you would nt,i do nt want to give you orders,hemingway
21387,21388,then i have to tell you the girl said,she let you read it,hemingway
21389,21390,yes,she said i should,hemingway
21391,21392,god damn her,she did nt do it to do wrong,hemingway
21393,21394,it was when she was so worried,so you read it all,hemingway
21395,21396,yes,it s wonderful,hemingway
21397,21398,it s so much better than the last book and now the stories are so much better than it or than anything,what about the madrid part,hemingway
21399,21400,he looked at her and she looked up at him and then moistened her lips and did not look away and she said very carefully i knew all about that because i m just the way you are,when they were lying together marita said you do nt think about her when you make love to me,hemingway
21401,21402,no stupid,you do nt want me to do her things,hemingway
21403,21404,because i know them all and i can do them,stop talking and just feel,hemingway
21405,21406,i can do them better than she can,stop talking,hemingway
21407,21408,please sleep for me,she kissed him and when she came back he was asleep,hemingway
21409,21410,he had meant to wait for her but he had fallen asleep while he waited,she lay down by him and kissed him and when he did not wake she lay by him very quietly and tried to sleep too,hemingway
21411,21412,but she was not sleepy and she kissed him very softly again and then commenced to play with him very gently while she pushed her breasts against him,he stirred in his sleep and she lay now with her head down below his chest and played softly and searchingly making small intimacies and discoveries,hemingway
21413,21414,it was a long cool afternoon and david slept and when he woke marita was gone and he heard the two girls voices on the terrace,he dressed and unbolted the door to his working room and then came out from the door of that room onto the flagstones,hemingway
21415,21416,there was no one on the terrace except the waiter who was taking in the tea things and he found the girls in the bar,it s just like meeting an exhusband catherine said,hemingway
21417,21418,it makes me feel very sophisticated,she had never looked gayer or more lovely,hemingway
21419,21420,i must say it agrees with you,she looked at david in mock appraisal,hemingway
21421,21422,do you think he s all right,marita said,hemingway
21423,21424,she looked at david and blushed,and well you might blush catherine said,hemingway
21425,21426,look at her david,she looks very well david said,hemingway
21427,21428,so do you,she looks about sixteen catherine said,hemingway
21429,21430,she said she told you about reading the narrative,i think you should have asked me david said,hemingway
21431,21432,i know i should catherine said,but i started to read it for myself and then it was so interesting i thought heiress ought to read it too,hemingway
21433,21434,i d have said no,but the point is catherine said if he ever says no about anything marita just keep right on,hemingway
21435,21436,it does nt mean a thing,i do nt believe it marita said,hemingway
21437,21438,she smiled at david,that s because he has nt written the narrative up to date,hemingway
21439,21440,when he does you ll find out,i m through with the narrative david said,hemingway
21441,21442,that s dirty catherine said,that was my present and our project,hemingway
21443,21444,you must write it david the girl said,you will wo nt you,hemingway
21445,21446,she wants to be in it david catherine said,and it will be so much better when you have a dark girl too,hemingway
21447,21448,david poured himself a glass of the champagne,he saw marita look at him a warning and he said to catherine i ll go on with it when i finish the stories,hemingway
21449,21450,what did you do with your day,i had a fine day,hemingway
21451,21452,i made decisions and planned things,oh god david said,hemingway
21453,21454,they re all straightforward plans catherine said,you do nt have to groan about them,hemingway
21455,21456,you ve been doing just whatever you wanted to do all day and i was pleased,but i have a right to make a few plans,hemingway
21457,21458,what sort of plans,david asked,hemingway
21459,21460,his voice sounded very flat,first we have to start seeing about getting the book out,hemingway
21461,21462,i m going to have to have the manuscript typed up to where it is now and see about getting illustrations,i have to see the artists and make the arrangements,hemingway
21463,21464,you ve had a very busy day david said,you know do nt you that you do nt get manuscripts typed until whoever writes them has gone over them and has them ready for typing,hemingway
21465,21466,that is nt necessary because i only need a rough draft to show the artists,i see,hemingway
21467,21468,and if i do nt want it copied yet,do nt you want it brought out,hemingway
21469,21470,i do,and someone has to get started on something practical,hemingway
21471,21472,who are the artists you thought up today,different ones for different parts,hemingway
21473,21474,marie laurencin pascen derain dufy and picasso,for christ sake derain,hemingway
21475,21476,ca nt you see a nice laurencin of marita and me in the car when we stopped the first time by the loup on the way to nice,nobody s written that,hemingway
21477,21478,well write it then,it s certainly much more interesting and instructive than a lot of natives in a kraal or whatever you call it covered with flies and scabs in central africa with your drunken father staggering around smelling of sour beer and not knowing which ones of the little horrors he had fathered,hemingway
21479,21480,there goes the ball game david said,what did you say david,hemingway
21481,21482,marita said,i said thank you very much for having lunch with me david told her,hemingway
21483,21484,why do nt you thank her for the rest of it,catherine said,hemingway
21485,21486,she really must have done something impressive to make you sleep as though you were dead until the absolute end of the afternoon,thank her for that at least,hemingway
21487,21488,thank you for going swimming david said to the girl,oh did you swim,hemingway
21489,21490,catherine said,i m glad you swam,hemingway
21491,21492,we swam quite far marita said,and we had a very good lunch,hemingway
21493,21494,did you have a good lunch catherine,i think so catherine said,hemingway
21495,21496,i do nt remember,where were you,hemingway
21497,21498,marita asked gently,saint raphael catherine said,hemingway
21499,21500,i remember stopping there but i ca nt remember about lunch,i never notice when i eat by myself,hemingway
21501,21502,but i m quite sure i did have lunch there,i know i intended to,hemingway
21503,21504,was it nice driving back,marita asked,hemingway
21505,21506,it was such a cool lovely afternoon,i do nt know catherine said,hemingway
21507,21508,i did nt notice,i was thinking about making the book and getting it started,hemingway
21509,21510,we have to get it started,i do nt know why david started to be difficult the moment i commenced to put a little order into it,hemingway
21511,21512,the whole thing has dragged along in such a haphazard way that i was suddenly ashamed of all of us,poor catherine marita said,hemingway
21513,21514,but now that you have it all planned you must feel better,i do catherine said,hemingway
21515,21516,i felt so happy when i came in,i knew i d made you happy and i d accomplished something practical too and then david made me feel like an idiot or a leper,hemingway
21517,21518,i ca nt help it if i m practical and sensible,i know devil david said,hemingway
21519,21520,i just did nt want to get the work mixed up,but it s you who mixed it up catherine said,hemingway
21521,21522,ca nt you see,jumping back and forth trying to write stories when all you had to do was keep on with the narrative that meant so much to all of us,hemingway
21523,21524,it was going so well too and we were just coming to the most exciting parts,someone has to show you that the stories are just your way of escaping your duty,hemingway
21525,21526,marita looked at him again and he knew what she was trying to tell him and he said i have to go get cleaned up,you tell marita about it and i ll be back,hemingway
21527,21528,we have other things to talk about catherine said,i m sorry i was rude about you and marita,hemingway
21529,21530,i could nt be happier about you really,david took everything that had been said in with him to the bathroom where he had a shower and changed into a newly washed fisherman s sweater and slacks,hemingway
21531,21532,it was quite cool now in the evening and marita was sitting at the bar looking at vogue,she s gone down to see about your room marita said,hemingway
21533,21534,how is she,how should i know david,hemingway
21535,21536,she s a very great publisher now,she s given up sex,hemingway
21537,21538,it does nt interest her anymore,it s childish really she says,hemingway
21539,21540,she does nt know how it could ever have meant anything to her,but she may decide to have an affair with another woman if she ever takes it up again,hemingway
21541,21542,there s quite a bit about another woman,christ i never thought it would go this way,hemingway
21543,21544,do nt marita said,no matter what or how it is i love you and you are going to write tomorrow,hemingway
21545,21546,catherine came in and said you look wonderful together and i m so proud,i feel as though i d invented you,hemingway
21547,21548,was he good today marita,we had a nice lunch marita said,hemingway
21549,21550,please be fair catherine,oh i know he s a satisfactory lover catherine said,hemingway
21551,21552,he s always that,that s just like his martinis or how he swims or skis or flew probably,hemingway
21553,21554,i never saw him with a plane,everyone says he was marvelous,hemingway
21555,21556,it s like acrobats really i suppose and just as dull,i was nt asking about that,hemingway
21557,21558,you were very good to let us spend a day together catherine marita said,you can spend the rest of your lives together catherine said,hemingway
21559,21560,if you do nt bore each other,i have no further need of either of you,hemingway
21561,21562,david was watching her in the mirror and she looked calm handsome and normal,he could see marita looking at her very sadly,hemingway
21563,21564,i do like to look at you though and i d like to hear you talk if you d ever open your mouths,how do you do said david,hemingway
21565,21566,that was quite a good effort catherine said,i m very well,hemingway
21567,21568,have any new plans,david asked,hemingway
21569,21570,he felt as though he were hailing a ship,only what i ve told you catherine went on,hemingway
21571,21572,they ll probably keep me quite busy,what was all the guff about another woman,hemingway
21573,21574,he felt marita kick him and he put his foot on hers to acknowledge,that s not guff catherine said,hemingway
21575,21576,i want to have one more try to see if i ve missed anything,i might have,hemingway
21577,21578,all of us are fallible david said and marita kicked him again,i want to see catherine said,hemingway
21579,21580,i know enough about that now so i should be able to tell,do nt worry about your dark girl,hemingway
21581,21582,she s not my type at all,she s yours,hemingway
21583,21584,she s what you like and very nice it is but not for me,i m not attracted to the gamin type,hemingway
21585,21586,perhaps i am a gamin marita said,that s a very polite word for that part,hemingway
21587,21588,but i m also more of a woman than you are catherine,go ahead and show david what sort of gamin you are,hemingway
21589,21590,he d like it,he knows what sort of woman i am,hemingway
21591,21592,that s splendid catherine said,i m glad you both found your tongues finally,hemingway
21593,21594,i do prefer conversation,you are nt really a woman at all marita said,hemingway
21595,21596,i know it catherine said,i ve tried to explain it to david often enough,hemingway
21597,21598,is nt that true david,david looked at her and said nothing,hemingway
21599,21600,did nt i,yes he said,hemingway
21601,21602,i did try and i broke myself in pieces in madrid to be a girl and all it did was break me in pieces catherine said,now all i am is through,hemingway
21603,21604,you re a girl and a boy both and you really are,you do nt have to change and it does nt kill you and i m not,hemingway
21605,21606,and now i m nothing,all i wanted was for david and you to be happy,hemingway
21607,21608,everything else i invent,marita said i know it and i try to tell david,hemingway
21609,21610,i know you do,but you do nt have to be loyal to me or to anything,hemingway
21611,21612,do nt do it,nobody would anyway and you probably are nt really,hemingway
21613,21614,but i tell you not to be,i want you to be happy and make him happy,hemingway
21615,21616,you can too and i ca nt and i know it,you re the finest girl there is marita said,hemingway
21617,21618,i m not,i m finished before i ever started,hemingway
21619,21620,no,i m the one marita said,hemingway
21621,21622,i was stupid and awful,you were nt stupid,hemingway
21623,21624,everything you said was true,let s stop talking and be friends,hemingway
21625,21626,can we,can we please,hemingway
21627,21628,marita asked her,i want to catherine said,hemingway
21629,21630,and not be such a tragic bully,please take your time about the book david,hemingway
21631,21632,you know all i want is for you to write the best you can,that s what we started with,hemingway
21633,21634,i m over it now whatever this one was,you were just tired david said,hemingway
21635,21636,i do nt think you ate any lunch either,probably not catherine said,hemingway
21637,21638,but i may have,can we forget it all now though and just be friends,hemingway
21639,21640,so they were friends whatever friends are david thought and tried not think but talked and listened in the unreality that reality had become,he had heard each one speak about the other and he knew each must know what the other thought and probably what they each had told him,hemingway
21641,21642,in that way they really were friends understanding in their basic disagreement trusting in their complete distrust and enjoying one another s company,he enjoyed their company too but tonight he d had enough of it,hemingway
21643,21644,tomorrow he must go back into his own country the one that catherine was jealous of and that marita loved and respected,he had been happy in the country of the story and knew that it was too good to last and now he was back from what he cared about into the overpopulated vacancy of madness that had taken now the new turn of exaggerated practicality,hemingway
21645,21646,he was tired of it and he was tired of marita s collaborating with her enemy,catherine was not his enemy except as she was himself in the unfinding unrealizable quest that is love and so was her own enemy,hemingway
21647,21648,she needs an enemy so badly always that she has to keep one near and she s the nearest and the easiest to attack knowing the weaknesses and strengths and all the faults of our defenses,she turns my flank so skillfully then finds it is her own and the last fighting is always in a swirl and the dust that rises is our own dust,hemingway
21649,21650,catherine wanted to play backgammon with marita after dinner,they always played it seriously and for money and when catherine went to get the board marita said to david please do nt come to my room tonight after all,hemingway
21651,21652,good,do you understand,hemingway
21653,21654,let s skip that word david said,his coldness had come back as the time for working moved closer,hemingway
21655,21656,are you angry,yes david said,hemingway
21657,21658,at me,you ca nt be angry with someone who s ill,hemingway
21659,21660,you have nt lived very long david said,that s exactly who everyone is always angry with,hemingway
21661,21662,get ill sometime yourself and see,i wish you would nt be angry,hemingway
21663,21664,i wish i d never seen any of you,please do nt david,hemingway
21665,21666,you know it is nt true,i m only getting ready to work,hemingway
21667,21668,he went into their bedroom and put on the reading light on his side of the bed and made himself comfortable and read one of the w h hudson books,it was nature in downland and he had taken it to read because it had the most unpromising title,hemingway
21669,21670,he knew enough to know a time was coming when he d need all the books and he was saving the best ones,but once past the title of this one nothing in it bored him,hemingway
21671,21672,he was happy to read and he was back out of his life and with hudson and his brother riding their horses into the tumbled whiteness of breasthigh thistledown in the moonlight and gradually the click of dice and the low sound of the girls voices became real again too so that when after a time he went out to make himself a whiskey and perrier to take back to his reading they seemed when he saw them playing to be actual human beings doing something normal and not figures in some unbelievable play he had been brought unwillingly to attend,he went back to the room and read and drank his whiskey and perrier very slowly and he had undressed and turned the light off and was almost asleep when he heard catherine come in to the bedroom,hemingway
21673,21674,it seemed to him that she was gone a long time in the bathroom before he felt her come to bed and he lay still and breathed steadily and hoped he might really go to sleep,are you awake david,hemingway
21675,21676,she asked,i think so,hemingway
21677,21678,do nt wake up she said,thank you for sleeping here,hemingway
21679,21680,i usually do,you do nt have to,hemingway
21681,21682,yes i do,i m glad you did,hemingway
21683,21684,good night,good night,hemingway
21685,21686,would you kiss me good night,sure he said,hemingway
21687,21688,he kissed her and it was catherine as she had been before when she had seemed to come back to him for a while,i m sorry i was such a failure again,hemingway
21689,21690,let s not talk about things,do you hate me,hemingway
21691,21692,can we start again the way i d planned things,i do nt think so,hemingway
21693,21694,then why did you come in here,this is where i belong,hemingway
21695,21696,no other reason,i thought you might be lonely,hemingway
21697,21698,i was,everybody s lonely david said,hemingway
21699,21700,it s terrible to be in bed together and be lonely,there is nt any solution david said,hemingway
21701,21702,all your plans and schemes are worthless,i did nt give it a chance,hemingway
21703,21704,it was all crazy anyway,i m sick of crazy things,hemingway
21705,21706,you re not the only one gets broken up,i know,hemingway
21707,21708,but ca nt we try it again just once more and i really be good,i can,hemingway
21709,21710,i nearly was,i m sick of all of it devil,hemingway
21711,21712,sick all the way through me,would nt you try it just once more for her and for me both,hemingway
21713,21714,it does nt work and i m sick of it,she said you had a fine day and that you were really cheerful and not depressed,hemingway
21715,21716,wo nt you try it once more for both of us,i want it so much,hemingway
21717,21718,you want everything so much and when you get it it s over and you do nt give a damn,i was just overconfident this time and then i get insufferable,hemingway
21719,21720,please can we try it again,let s go to sleep devil and not talk about it,hemingway
21721,21722,kiss me again please catherine said,i ll go to sleep because i know you ll do it,hemingway
21723,21724,you always do everything i want because you really want to do it too,you only want things for you devil,hemingway
21725,21726,that s not true david,anyway i am you and her,hemingway
21727,21728,that s what i did it for,i m everybody,hemingway
21729,21730,you know about that do nt you,go to sleep devil,hemingway
21731,21732,i will,but would you please kiss me again first so that we wo nt be lonely,hemingway
21733,21734,the elephant was no longer travelling as he had been but was moving aimlessly now feeding occasionally and david had known they were getting dose to him,he tried to remember how he had felt,hemingway
21735,21736,he had no love for the elephant yet,he must remember that,hemingway
21737,21738,he had only a sorrow that had come from his own tiredness that had brought an understanding of age,though being too young he had learned how it must be to be too old,hemingway
21739,21740,he was lonesome for kibo and thinking of juma killing the elephant s friend had turned him against juma and made the elephant his brother,he knew then how much it meant to him to have seen the elephant in the moonlight and for him to have followed him with kibo and come close to him in the clearing so that he had seen both of the great tusks,hemingway
21741,21742,but he did not know that nothing would ever be as good as that again,now he knew they would kill the elephant and there was nothing he could do about it,hemingway
21743,21744,he had betrayed the elephant when he had gone back to tell them at the shamba,they would kill me and they would kill kibo too if we had ivory he had thought and known it was untrue,hemingway
21745,21746,probably the elephant is going to find where he was born now and they ll kill him there,that s all they d need to make it perfect,hemingway
21747,21748,they d like to have killed him where they killed his friend,that would be a big joke,hemingway
21749,21750,that would have pleased them,the god damned friend killers,hemingway
21751,21752,they had moved to the edge of thick cover now and the elephant was close ahead,david could smell him and they could all hear him pulling down branches and the snapping that they made,hemingway
21753,21754,his father put his hand on david s shoulder to move him back and have him wait outside and then he took a big pinch of ashes from the pouch in his pocket and tossed it in the air,the ash barely slanted toward them as it fell and his father nodded at juma and bent down to follow him into the thick cover,hemingway
21755,21756,david watched their backs and their asses go in and out of sight,he could not hear them move,hemingway
21757,21758,david had stood still and listened to the elephant feeding,he could smell him as strongly as he had the night in the moonlight when he had worked up close to him and had seen his wonderful tusks,hemingway
21759,21760,then as he stood there it was silent and he could not smell the elephant,then there had been a high squealing and smashing and a shot by the then the heavy rocking double report of his father s then the smashing and crashing had gone on going steadily away and he had gone into the heavy growth and found juma standing shaken and bleeding from his forehead all down over his face and his father white and angry,hemingway
21761,21762,he went for juma and knocked him over his father had said,juma hit him in the head,hemingway
21763,21764,where did you hit him,where i fucking well could his father had said,hemingway
21765,21766,get on the fucking blood spoor,there was plenty of blood,hemingway
21767,21768,one stream as high as david s head that had squirted bright on trunks and leaves and vines and another much lower that was dark and foul with stomach content,lung and gut shot his father said,hemingway
21769,21770,we ll find him down or hope the hell he added,they found him anchored in such suffering and despair that he could no longer move,hemingway
21771,21772,he had crashed through the heavy cover where he had been feeding and crossed a path of open forest and david and his father had run along the heavily splashed blood trail,then the elephant had gone on into thick forest and david had seen him ahead standing gray and huge against the trunk of a tree,hemingway
21773,21774,david could only see his stern and then his father moved ahead of him and he followed and they came alongside the elephant as though he was a ship and david saw the blood coming from his ranks and running down his sides and then his father raised his rifle and fired and the elephant turned his head with the great tusks moving heavy and slow and looked at them and when his father fired the second barrel the elephant seemed to sway like a felled tree and came smashing down toward them,but he was not dead,hemingway
21775,21776,he had been anchored and now he was down with his shoulder broken,he did not move but his eye was alive and looked at david,hemingway
21777,21778,he had very long eyelashes and his eye was the most alive thing david had ever seen,shoot him in the ear hole with the three oh three his father said,hemingway
21779,21780,go on,you shoot him david had said,hemingway
21781,21782,juma had come up limping and bloody the skin of his fore head hanging down over his left eye the bone of his nose showing and one ear torn and had taken the rifle from david without speaking and pushed the muzzle almost into the ear hole and fired twice jerking the bolt and driving it forward angrily,the eye of the elephant had opened wide on the first shot and then started to glaze and blood came out of the ear and ran in two bright streams down the wrinkled gray hide,hemingway
21783,21784,it was a different colored blood and david had thought i must remember that and he had but it had never been of any use to him,now all the dignity and majesty and all the beauty was gone from the elephant and he was a huge wrinkled pile,hemingway
21785,21786,well we got him davey thanks to you his father had said,now we d better get a fire going so i can put juma back together again,hemingway
21787,21788,come here you bloody humpty dumpty,those tusks will keep,hemingway
21789,21790,juma had come to him grinning bringing the tail of the elephant that had no hairs on it at all,how far will you have to go to get people to get those tusks out of here,hemingway
21791,21792,how are you you worthless old pig fucker,what have you broken,hemingway
21793,21794,then with the answers known his father had said you and i will go back to get the packs where we dropped them when we went in after him,juma can get wood and have the fire ready,hemingway
21795,21796,the medical kit is in my pack,we have to get the packs before it s dark,hemingway
21797,21798,he wo nt infect,it s not like claw wounds,hemingway
21799,21800,let s go,his father had known how he had felt about the elephant and that night and in the next few days he had tried if not to convert him to bring him back to the boy he had been before he had come to the knowledge that he hated elephant hunting,hemingway
21801,21802,david had put no statement of his father s intention which had never been stated in the story but had only used the happenings the disgusts the events and feelings of the butchering and the work of chopping out the tusks and of the rough surgery on juma disguised by mockery and railery to keep the pain in contempt and reduce its stature since there were no drugs,the added responsibility david was given and the trust that was offered him and not accepted he had put in the story without pointing their significance,hemingway
21803,21804,he had tried to make the elephant alive beneath the tree anchored in his final anguish and drowning in the blood that had flowed so many times before but always staunched and now was rising in him so he could not breathe the great heart pumping it to drown him as he watched the man who came to finish him,david had been so proud the elephant had scented juma and charged him instantly,hemingway
21805,21806,he would have killed juma if his father had not fired into him so that he had thrown juma into the trees with his trunk and charged on with the death in him feeling it as only another wound until the blood welled up and he could not breathe against it,that evening as david had sat by the fire he had looked at juma with his stitched up face and his broken ribs that he tried to breathe without and wondered if the elephant had recognized him when he had tried to kill him,hemingway
21807,21808,he hoped he had,the elephant was his hero now as his father had been for a long time and he had thought i did not believe he could do it when he was so old and tired,hemingway
21809,21810,he would have killed juma too,but he did nt look at me as though he wanted to kill me,hemingway
21811,21812,he only looked sad the same way i felt,he visited his old friend on the day he died,hemingway
21813,21814,it was a very young boy s story he knew when he had finished it,he read it over and saw the gaps he must fill in to make it so that whoever read it would feel it was truly happening as it was read and he marked the gaps in the margin,hemingway
21815,21816,he remembered how the elephant lost all dignity as soon as his eye had ceased to be alive and how when his father and he had returned with the packs the elephant had already started to swell even in the cool evening,there was no more true elephant only the gray wrinkled swelling dead body and the huge great mottled brown and yellow tusks that they had killed him for,hemingway
21817,21818,the tusks were stained with the dried blood and he scraped some of it off with his thumbnail like a dried piece of sealing wax and put it in the pocket of his shirt,that was all he took from the elephant except the beginning of the knowledge of loneliness,hemingway
21819,21820,after the butchery his father tried to talk to him that night by the fire,he was a murderer you know davey he had said,hemingway
21821,21822,juma says nobody knows how many people he has killed,they were all trying to kill him were nt they,hemingway
21823,21824,naturally his father had said with that pair of tusks,how could he be a murderer then,hemingway
21825,21826,just as you like his father had said,i m sorry you got so mixed up about him,hemingway
21827,21828,i wish he d killed juma david had said,i think that s carrying it a little far his father said,hemingway
21829,21830,juma s your friend you know,not anymore,hemingway
21831,21832,no need to tell him so,he knows it david had said,hemingway
21833,21834,i think you misjudge him his father said and they had left it there,then when they were finally back safely with the tusks after all the things that had happened and the tusks were propped against the wall of the stick and mud house leaning there with their points touching the tusks so tall and thick that no one could believe them even when they touched them and no one not even his father could reach to the top of the bend where they curved in for the points to meet there when juma and his father and he were heroes and kibo was a hero s dog and the men who had carried the tusks were heroes already slightly drunk heroes and to be drunker his father had said do you want to make peace davey,hemingway
21835,21836,all right he said because he knew this was the start of the never telling that he had decided on,i m so glad his father said,hemingway
21837,21838,it s so much simpler and better,then they sat on old men s stools under the shade of the great fig tree with the tusks against the wall of the hut and drank native beer from gourd cups that were brought by a young girl and her younger brother no longer a detested nuisance but the servant of heroes sitting in the dust by the heroic dog of a hero who held an old cockerel newly promoted to the standing of the heroes favorite rooster,hemingway
21839,21840,they sat there and drank beer while the big drum started and the ngoma began to build,he came out of the working room and he was happy and empty and proud and marita was waiting for him on the terrace sitting in the sun of the bright early fall morning that he had not known existed,hemingway
21841,21842,it was a perfect morning still and cool,the sea below was a flat calm and across the bay was the white curve of cannes with the dark mountains behind it,hemingway
21843,21844,i love you very much he said to the dark girl as she stood up,he put his arms around her and kissed her and she said you finished it,hemingway
21845,21846,sure he said,why not,hemingway
21847,21848,i love you and i m so proud she said,they walked out and looked at the sea with their arms around each other,hemingway
21849,21850,how are you girl,i m very well and very happy marita said,hemingway
21851,21852,did you mean it about loving me or was it just the morning,it was the morning david said and kissed her again,hemingway
21853,21854,can i read the story,it s too lovely a day,hemingway
21855,21856,ca nt i read it so i can feel like you do and not just happy because you re happy like i was your dog,he gave her the key and when she brought the notebooks and read the story at the bar david read it sitting beside her,hemingway
21857,21858,he knew it was ill mannered and stupid,he had never done this before with anyone and it was against everything he believed about writing but he did not think of that except at the moment when he put his arm around the girl and looked at the writing on the lined paper,hemingway
21859,21860,he could not help wanting to read it with her and he could not help sharing what he had never shared and what he had believed could not and should not be shared,when she finished reading marita put her arms around david and kissed him so hard that she drew blood from his lip,hemingway
21861,21862,he looked at her and tasted his blood absentmindedly and smiled,i m sorry david she said,hemingway
21863,21864,please forgive me,i m so very happy and prouder than you are,hemingway
21865,21866,is it all right,he said,hemingway
21867,21868,can you smell the shamba smell and the clean smell of hut inside and feel the smoothness of the old men chairs,it s really clean in the hut and the earth floor is swept,hemingway
21869,21870,of course it is,you had it in the other story,hemingway
21871,21872,i can see the angle of the head of kibo the heroic dog too,you were such a lovely hero,hemingway
21873,21874,did the blood make a stain in your pocket,yes,hemingway
21875,21876,it softened when i sweated,let s go to town and celebrate the day marita said,hemingway
21877,21878,there s a lot of things that we can do today,david stopped at the bar and poured haig pinch and then cold perrier into a glass and brought it with him to the room where he drank half of it and took a cold shower,hemingway
21879,21880,then he pulled on slacks and a shirt and put on alpargatas to go into town,he felt the story was good and felt even better about marita,hemingway
21881,21882,neither had been diminished by the sharpening of perception he had now and clarity had come with no sadness,catherine was doing whatever she was doing and would do whatever she would do,hemingway
21883,21884,he looked out and felt the old happy carelessness,it was a day for flying actually,hemingway
21885,21886,he wished there was a field where he could rent a plane and take marita up and show her what you could do with a day like this,she might like it,hemingway
21887,21888,but there is nt any field here,so forget that,hemingway
21889,21890,it would be fun though,so would skiing,hemingway
21891,21892,that s only two months away if you want it,christ it was good to finish today and have her there,hemingway
21893,21894,marita there with no damned jealousy of the work and have her know what you were reaching for and how far you went,she really knows and it s not faked,hemingway
21895,21896,i do love her and you make a note of it whiskey and you witness it for me perrier old boy old perrier i have been faithful to you perrier in my fucking fashion,it feels very good when you feel so good,hemingway
21897,21898,it s a stupid feeling but it fits on this day so put it on,come on girl he said to marita at the door of her room,hemingway
21899,21900,what s holding you up besides your beautiful legs,i m ready david she said,hemingway
21901,21902,she had on a tight sweater and slacks and her face was shining,she brushed her dark hair and looked at him,hemingway
21903,21904,it s wonderful when you re so gay,it s such a good day he said,hemingway
21905,21906,and we re so lucky,do you think so,hemingway
21907,21908,she said as they walked to the car,do you think we re really lucky,hemingway
21909,21910,yes he said,i think it changed this morning or maybe in the night,hemingway
21911,21912,it was parked on the right side of the gravelled approach,david stopped the isotta behind it and he and marita got out and walked down the drive past the small low empty blue car and onto the flagstones of the walk without speaking,hemingway
21913,21914,they passed david s room with the locked door and the open windows and marita stopped outside of her door and said good bye,what are you doing this afternoon,hemingway
21915,21916,he asked,i do nt know she said,hemingway
21917,21918,i ll be here,he walked on down to the patio of the hotel and went in the main door,hemingway
21919,21920,catherine was sitting at the bar reading the paris herald with a glass and half a bottle of wine beside her on the bar,she looked up at him,hemingway
21921,21922,what brought you back,she asked,hemingway
21923,21924,we had lunch in town and came on up david said,how is your whore,hemingway
21925,21926,i have nt one yet,i mean the one you write the stories for,hemingway
21927,21928,oh,the stories,hemingway
21929,21930,yes,the stories,hemingway
21931,21932,the dreary dismal little stories about your adolescence with your bogus drunken father,he was nt so bogus really,hemingway
21933,21934,did nt he defraud his wife and all his friends,no,hemingway
21935,21936,just himself really,you certainly make him despicable in these last sketches or vignettes or pointless anecdotes you write about him,hemingway
21937,21938,you mean the stories,you call them stories catherine said,hemingway
21939,21940,yes david said and poured a glass of the lovely cold wine on the bright clear day in the pleasant sunny room in the clean comfortable hotel and sipping it felt it fail to lift up his dead cold heart,would you like me to go and get heiress,hemingway
21941,21942,catherine said,it would nt do to have her think that we d had a misunderstanding about whose day it is or that we d taken up solitary drinking together,hemingway
21943,21944,you do nt need to get her,i d like to,hemingway
21945,21946,she took care of you today and i did nt,really david i m not a bitch yet,hemingway
21947,21948,i just act and talk like one,while david waited for catherine to come back he drank another glass of the champagne and read the paris edition of the new york herald she had left on the bar,hemingway
21949,21950,drinking the wine by himself it did not taste the same and he found a cork in the kitchen to stop up the bottle before he put it back in the ice chest,but the bottle did not feel heavy enough and lifting it against the light that came in the west window he saw how little wine was left and he poured it out and drank it off and put the bottle down on the tiled floor,hemingway
21951,21952,even when he drank it off quickly it did nothing for him,thank cod he was breaking through on the stories now,hemingway
21953,21954,what had made the last book good was the people who were in it and the accuracy of the detail which made it believable,he had really only to remember accurately and the form came by what he would choose to leave out,hemingway
21955,21956,then of course he could close it like the diaphragm of a camera and intensify it so it could be concentrated to the point where the heat shone bright and the smoke began to rise,he knew that he was getting this now,hemingway
21957,21958,what catherine had said about the stories when she was trying to hurt him had started him thinking about his father and all the things he had tried to do whatever he could about,now he told himself you must try to grow up again and face what you have to face without being irritable or hurt that someone did not understand and appreciate what you wrote,hemingway
21959,21960,she understands it less and less,but you ve worked well and nothing can touch you as long as you can work,hemingway
21961,21962,try to help her now and forget about yourself,tomorrow you have the story to go over and to make perfect,hemingway
21963,21964,but david did not want to think about the story,he cared about the writing more than about anything else and he cared about many things but he knew that when he was doing it he must not worry about it nor finger it nor handle it any more than he would open up the door of the darkroom to see how a negative was developing,hemingway
21965,21966,leave it alone he told himself,you are a bloody fool but you know that much,hemingway
21967,21968,his thoughts turned to the two girls and he wondered if he should go find them and see what they wanted to do or if they wanted to go off and swim,after all it was marita s and his day and she might be waiting,hemingway
21969,21970,maybe something could still be salvaged out of the day for all of them,they might be cooking something up,hemingway
21971,21972,he ought to go by and ask what they wanted to do,then do it he told himself,hemingway
21973,21974,do nt stand here and think about it,go on and find them,hemingway
21975,21976,the door to marita s room was shut and he knocked on it,they had been talking and when he knocked the talking stopped,hemingway
21977,21978,who is it,marita asked,hemingway
21979,21980,he heard catherine laugh and she said come in whoever you are,he heard marita say something to her and catherine said come in david,hemingway
21981,21982,he opened the door,they were lying in the big bed together side by side the sheet pulled up under their chins,hemingway
21983,21984,please come in david catherine said,we ve been waiting for you,hemingway
21985,21986,david looked at them the serious dark girl and the fair laugh ing one,marita looked at him trying to tell him something,hemingway
21987,21988,catherine was laughing,wo nt you come in too david,hemingway
21989,21990,i came by to see if you wanted to go to swim or anything david said,i do nt want to catherine said,hemingway
21991,21992,heiress was in bed asleep and i got into bed with her,she was very good and asked me to leave,hemingway
21993,21994,she s not a bit unfaithful to you,not in the least little bit,hemingway
21995,21996,but wo nt you come in too so we can both be faithful to you,no david said,hemingway
21997,21998,please david catherine said,it s such a lovely day,hemingway
21999,22000,do you want to go to swim,david asked marita,hemingway
22001,22002,i d like to the girl said above the sheet,you two puritans catherine said,hemingway
22003,22004,please both be reasonable and come to bed david,i want to go to swim marita said,hemingway
22005,22006,please go out david,why ca nt he see you,hemingway
22007,22008,catherine asked,he sees you at the beach,hemingway
22009,22010,he ll see me at the cove marita said,please go out david,hemingway
22011,22012,david went out and closed the door without looking back hearing marita talking in a low voice to catherine and catherine s laughter,he walked down the flagstones to the front of the hotel and looked out at the sea,hemingway
22013,22014,there was a light breeze now and he watched three french destroyers and a cruiser neat and dark and sharply etched on the blue sea as they moved in formation working out some problems,they were far out and they looked to be recognition silhouettes from their size until a white line would show at the bow as a ship speeded up to change the pattern,hemingway
22015,22016,david watched them until the two girls came up to him,please do nt be cross catherine said,hemingway
22017,22018,they were dressed to go to the beach and catherine put a bag with the towels and the robes on an iron chair,are you going swimming too,hemingway
22019,22020,david said to her,if you re not angry with me,hemingway
22021,22022,david said nothing and watched the ships as they changed course and another destroyer moved out of the pattern at a sharp angle with the line of white curling back from her bows,she began to make smoke and it trailed in a black widening plume as she curved at flank speed,hemingway
22023,22024,it was only a joke catherine said,we d been making such good rough jokes,hemingway
22025,22026,you and i had,what are they doing david,hemingway
22027,22028,marita asked,antisub maneuvers i think he said,hemingway
22029,22030,maybe there are subs working with them,they re probably out from toulon,hemingway
22031,22032,they were in sainte maxime or saint raphael catherine said,i saw them the other day,hemingway
22033,22034,i do nt know what it is now with the smoke screen david said,there must be other ships we cane t see,hemingway
22035,22036,there come the planes marita said,are nt they lovely,hemingway
22037,22038,they were very small neat seaplanes and three of them were coming around the point low over the water,when we were here in the early summer they had gunnery practice off the porquerolles and it was terrific catherine said,hemingway
22039,22040,it shook the window,will they use depth bombs now david,hemingway
22041,22042,i do nt know,i should nt think so if they re working with real subs,hemingway
22043,22044,i can go to swim ca nt i please david,catherine asked,hemingway
22045,22046,i m going away and then you can swim all the time by yourselves,i asked you to swim david said,hemingway
22047,22048,that s true catherine said,you did,hemingway
22049,22050,then let s go now and all be friends and happy,if the planes come in close they can see us on the beach at the cove and that will cheer them up,hemingway
22051,22052,the planes did come by close off the cove while david and marita were swimming far out and catherine was tanning on the beach,they passed rapidly three echelons of three their big rhone motors roaring suddenly as they flew over then dying away as they went toward sainte maxime,hemingway
22053,22054,david and marita swam back in to the beach and sat on the sand by catherine,they never even looked at me catherine said,hemingway
22055,22056,they must be very serious boys,what did you expect,hemingway
22057,22058,aerial photography,david asked her,hemingway
22059,22060,marita had said very little since they had left the hotel and she said nothing to this,it was fun when david really did live with me catherine said to her,hemingway
22061,22062,i can remember when i liked everything that david did,you must try to like his things too heiress,hemingway
22063,22064,that is if he has any left,do you have any left david,hemingway
22065,22066,marita asked,he traded everything he had in on those stories catherine said,hemingway
22067,22068,he used to have so many things,i certainly hope you like stories heiress,hemingway
22069,22070,i like them marita said,she did not look at david but he saw her serene dark face and sea wet hair and smooth lovely skin and her beautiful body as she sat looking out at the sea,hemingway
22071,22072,that s good catherine said lazily and took a long deep lazy breath as she stretched out on the beach robe on the sand that was still warm from the afternoon sun,because that s what you re going to get,hemingway
22073,22074,he used to do so many things too and he did them all so beautifully,he had a wonderful life and all he thinks about now is africa and his drunken father and his press cuttings,hemingway
22075,22076,his clippings,has he ever shown you his clippings heiress,hemingway
22077,22078,no catherine marita said,he will catherine said,hemingway
22079,22080,he tried to show them to me once at le grau du roi but i put a stop to that,there were hundreds of them and every one almost had his picture and they were all the same pictures,hemingway
22081,22082,it s worse than carrying around obscene post cards really,i think he reads them by himself and is unfaithful to me with them,hemingway
22083,22084,in a wastebasket probably,he always has a wastebasket,hemingway
22085,22086,i think i m getting cold,i mean the wastebasket was the most important thing for a writer catherine said,hemingway
22087,22088,i used to think i ought to get him a really wonderful one that would be worthy of him,but he never puts anything he writes in the wastebasket,hemingway
22089,22090,he writes in those ridiculous child s notebooks and he does nt throw anything away,he just crosses things out and writes along the sides of the pages,hemingway
22091,22092,the whole business is a fraud really,he makes mistakes in spelling and grammar too,hemingway
22093,22094,did you know marita that he does nt even really know grammar,poor david marita said,hemingway
22095,22096,of course his french is worse catherine said,you ve never seen him try to write it,hemingway
22097,22098,he fakes along well enough in conversation and he s amusing with his slang,but actually he s illiterate,hemingway
22099,22100,too bad said david,i thought he was wonderful catherine said until i found he could nt write even a simple note correctly,hemingway
22101,22102,but then you ll be able to write in french for him,ta gueule david said cheerfully,hemingway
22103,22104,he s good at that sort of thing catherine said,quick tags of slang that are probably outdated before he knows it,hemingway
22105,22106,he speaks very idiomatic french but he ca nt write it at all,he s really illiterate marita and you have to face it,hemingway
22107,22108,his handwriting is terrible too,he ca nt write like a gentleman nor speak like one in any language,hemingway
22109,22110,especially not his own,poor david marita said,hemingway
22111,22112,i ca nt say i ve given him the best years of my life catherine said,because i ve only lived with him since march i think it was but i ve certainly given him the best months of my life,hemingway
22113,22114,the ones i ve had the most fun in anyway and he certainly made them fun too,i wish it had nt ended in complete disillusion too but what are you to do if you discover the man is illiterate and practices solitary vice in a wastebasket full of clippings from something called the original romeike s whoever they are,hemingway
22115,22116,any girl would be discouraged and frankly i m not going to put up with it,you take the clippings and burn them david said,hemingway
22117,22118,that would be the soundest thing,would nt you like to go in now and swim devil,hemingway
22119,22120,catherine looked at him slyly,how did you know i did it,hemingway
22121,22122,she asked,did what,hemingway
22123,22124,burned the clippings,did you catherine,hemingway
22125,22126,marita asked,of course i did catherine said,hemingway
22127,22128,david stood looking at her,he felt completely hollow,hemingway
22129,22130,it was like coming around a curve on a mountain road and the road not being there and only a gulf ahead,marita was standing now too,hemingway
22131,22132,catherine was looking at them her face calm and reasonable,let s go in and swim marita said,hemingway
22133,22134,we ll just swim out to the point and back,i m glad you re being pleasant finally catherine said,hemingway
22135,22136,i ve been wanting to go in for a long time,it s really getting quite cool,hemingway
22137,22138,we forget it s september,the got in and david drove back to the hotel in the early evening light,hemingway
22139,22140,catherine was quiet in the car and to anyone passing them they might have been returning from any afternoon at one of the unfrequented beaches of the estérel,the war ships were no longer in sight when they left the car on the driveway and the sea beyond the pines was blue and calm,hemingway
22141,22142,the evening was as beautiful and clear as the morning had been,they walked down to the entrance of the hotel and david took the bag with the beach things into the storeroom and put it down,hemingway
22143,22144,let me take them catherine said,they ought to go to dry,hemingway
22145,22146,i m sorry david said,he turned at the door of the storeroom and walked out and then down to his work room at the end of the hotel,hemingway
22147,22148,inside the room he opened the big vuitton suitcase,the pile of cahiers that the stories had been written in was gone,hemingway
22149,22150,so were the four bulky envelopes from the bank that had contained the press clippings,the pile of cahiers with the narrative written in them were intact,hemingway
22151,22152,he closed and locked the suitcase and searched all of the drawers in the armoire and searched the room,he had not believed that the stories could be gone,hemingway
22153,22154,he had not believed that she could do it,at the beach he had known that she might have done it but it had seemed impossible and he had not really believed it,hemingway
22155,22156,they had been calm and careful and restrained about it as you were trained to be in danger or emergency or in disaster but it had not seemed possible that it could really have happened,now he knew that it had happened but still thought it might be some ghastly joke,hemingway
22157,22158,so empty and dead in his heart he reopened the suitcase and checked it and after he locked it he checked the room again,now there was no danger and no emergency,hemingway
22159,22160,it was only disaster now,but it could nt be,hemingway
22161,22162,she must have hidden them someplace,they could be in the storeroom or in their own room or she could have put them in marita s room,hemingway
22163,22164,she could nt really have destroyed them,no one could do that to a fellow human being,hemingway
22165,22166,he still could not believe that she had done it but he felt sick inside himself when he closed and locked the door,the two girls were at the bar when david came in,hemingway
22167,22168,marita looked up at him and saw how things were and catherine watched him come in by looking at the mirror,she did not look at him only at his reflection in the mirror,hemingway
22169,22170,where did you put them devil,david asked,hemingway
22171,22172,she turned away from the mirror and looked at him,i wo nt tell you she said,hemingway
22173,22174,i took care of them,i wish you d tell me david said,hemingway
22175,22176,because i need them very much,no you do nt she said,hemingway
22177,22178,they were worthless and i hated them,not the one about kibo david said,hemingway
22179,22180,you loved kibo,do nt you remember,hemingway
22181,22182,he had to go too,i was going to tear him out and keep him but i could nt find him,hemingway
22183,22184,anyway you said he was dead,david saw marita look at her and look away,hemingway
22185,22186,then she looked back,where did you burn them catherine,hemingway
22187,22188,i wo nt tell you either catherine said,you re part of the same thing,hemingway
22189,22190,did you burn them with the clipping,david asked,hemingway
22191,22192,i wo nt tell you catherine said,you talk to me like a policeman or at school,hemingway
22193,22194,tell me devil,i only want to know,hemingway
22195,22196,i paid for them catherine said,i paid the money to do them,hemingway
22197,22198,i know david said,it was very generous of you,hemingway
22199,22200,where did you burn them devil,i wo nt tell her,hemingway
22201,22202,no,just tell me,hemingway
22203,22204,ask her to go away,i really have to go anyway marita said,hemingway
22205,22206,i ll see you later catherine,that s good catherine said,hemingway
22207,22208,it was nt your fault heiress,david sat on the tall stool by catherine and she looked in the mirror and watched marita go out of the room,hemingway
22209,22210,where did you burn them devil,david asked,hemingway
22211,22212,you can tell me now,she would nt understand catherine said,hemingway
22213,22214,that s why i wanted her to go,i know said david,hemingway
22215,22216,where did you burn them devil,in the iron drum with holes that madame uses to burn trash catherine said,hemingway
22217,22218,did everything burn up,yes,hemingway
22219,22220,i poured on some petrol from a bidon in the remise,it made a big fire and everything burned,hemingway
22221,22222,i did it for you david and for all of us,i m sure you did david said,hemingway
22223,22224,did everything burn,oh yes,hemingway
22225,22226,we can go out and look if you like but it is nt necessary,the paper all burned black and i stirred it up with a stick,hemingway
22227,22228,i ll just go out and have a look david said,but you ll be back catherine said,hemingway
22229,22230,sure david said,the burning had been in the trash burner which was a former fiftyfivegallon gasoline drum with holes punched in it,hemingway
22231,22232,the stick used to stir the ashes and still freshly blackened on one end was an old broom handle which had been used in this capacity before,the bidon was in the stone shed and contained kerosene,hemingway
22233,22234,in the drum were a few identifiable charred bits of the green covers of the cahiers and david found scraps of burnt newsprint and two charred bits of pink paper which he identified as those used by the romeike s clipping service,on one he could distinguish the providence ri dateline,hemingway
22235,22236,the ashes had been well stirred but there would doubtless have been more unburned or charred material if he had cared to sift or examine them patiently,he tore the pink paper with providence ri printed on it into small pieces and dropped them in the former gasoline drum which he had replaced in an upright position,hemingway
22237,22238,he reflected that he had never been in providence rhode island and replacing the broom handle in the stone shed where he noticed the presence of his racing bicycle the tires of which needed inflation he reentered the kitchen of the hotel which was empty and proceeded to the salon where he joined his wife catherine at the bar,was nt it just the way i said,hemingway
22239,22240,catherine asked,yes david said and sat down on one of the stools and put his elbows on the bar,hemingway
22241,22242,it probably would have been enough to burn the clippings catherine said,but i really thought i ought to make a clean sweep,hemingway
22243,22244,you did all right david said,now you can go right on with the narrative and there will be nothing to interrupt you,hemingway
22245,22246,you can start in the morning,sure david said,hemingway
22247,22248,i m glad you re reasonable about it catherine said,you could nt know how worthless they were david,hemingway
22249,22250,i had to show you,you could nt have kept the kibo one that you liked,hemingway
22251,22252,i told you i tried to find it,but if you want to rewrite it i can tell it to you word for word,hemingway
22253,22254,that will be fun,it will be really,hemingway
22255,22256,you ll see,do you want me to tell it to you now,hemingway
22257,22258,we could if you want,no david said,hemingway
22259,22260,not just now,would you write it though,hemingway
22261,22262,i ca nt write things david,you know that,hemingway
22263,22264,but i can tell it to you anytime you want,you do nt really care about the others do you,hemingway
22265,22266,they were worthless,why did you do it really,hemingway
22267,22268,to help you,you can go to africa and write them again when your viewpoint is more mature,hemingway
22269,22270,the country ca nt be changed very much,i think it would be nice if you wrote about spain instead though,hemingway
22271,22272,you said the country was almost the same as africa and there you d have the advantage of a civilized language,david poured himself a whiskey and found a bottle of perrier uncapped it and poured some in the glass,hemingway
22273,22274,he remembered the day they had passed the place where they bottled perrier water on the plain on the way to aigues mortes and let s not talk about writing he said to catherine,i like to catherine said,hemingway
22275,22276,when it s constructive and has some valid purpose,you always wrote so well until you started those stories,hemingway
22277,22278,the worst thing was the dirt and the flies and the cruelty and the bestiality,you seemed almost to grovel in it,hemingway
22279,22280,that horrible one about the massacre in the crater and the heart lessness of your own father,can we not talk about them,hemingway
22281,22282,david asked,i want to talk about them catherine said,hemingway
22283,22284,i want to make you realize why it was necessary to burn them,write it out david said,hemingway
22285,22286,i d rather not hear it now,but i ca nt write things david,hemingway
22287,22288,you will david said,no,hemingway
22289,22290,but i ll tell them to someone who can write them catherine said,if you were friendly you d write them for me,hemingway
22291,22292,if you really loved me you d be happy to,all i want to do is kill you david said,hemingway
22293,22294,and the only reason i do nt do it is because you are crazy,you ca nt talk to me like that david,hemingway
22295,22296,no,no you ca nt,hemingway
22297,22298,you ca nt,do you hear me,hemingway
22299,22300,i hear you,then hear me say you ca nt say such things,hemingway
22301,22302,you ca nt say horrible things like that to me,i hear you david said,hemingway
22303,22304,you ca nt say such things,i wo nt stand for it,hemingway
22305,22306,i ll divorce you,that would be very welcome,hemingway
22307,22308,then i ll stay married to you and never give you a divorce,that would be pretty,hemingway
22309,22310,i ll do anything i want to you,you have,hemingway
22311,22312,i ll kill you,i would nt give a shit david said,hemingway
22313,22314,you ca nt even talk like a gentleman at a time like this,what would a gentleman say at a time like this,hemingway
22315,22316,that he was sorry,all right david said,hemingway
22317,22318,i m sorry,i m sorry i ever met you,hemingway
22319,22320,shut up please,you can tell it to somebody who can write it down,hemingway
22321,22322,i m sorry your mother ever met your father and that they ever made you,i m sorry you were born and that you grew up,hemingway
22323,22324,no he said,i ll shut up,hemingway
22325,22326,i did nt mean to make a speech,you re just really sorry for yourself,hemingway
22327,22328,possibly david said,but shit devil why did you have to burn them,hemingway
22329,22330,the stories,i had to david she said,hemingway
22331,22332,i m sorry if you do nt understand,he had understood really before he had asked her the question and the question had been he realized a rhetorical one,hemingway
22333,22334,he dis liked rhetoric and distrusted those who used it and he was ashamed to have fallen into it,he drank the whiskey and perrier slowly while he thought how untrue it was that everything that was understood was forgiven and he tightened his own discipline as conscientiously as he would have worked in the old days with the mechanic and the armorer going over the plane the engine and his guns,hemingway
22335,22336,it was not necessary then because they did the work perfectly but it was one way of not thinking and it was to use a wet word comforting,now it was necessary because what he had said to catherine about killing her he had said quite truly and not rhetorically,hemingway
22337,22338,he was ashamed of the speech which had followed the statement,but there was nothing he could do about the statement which was truly made except tighten his discipline so that he would have it in case he began to lose control,hemingway
22339,22340,he poured himself another whiskey and put in perrier again and watched the small bubbles form and break,god damn her to hell he thought,hemingway
22341,22342,i m sorry to be stuffy he said,i understand of course,hemingway
22343,22344,i m so glad david she said,i m going away in the morning,hemingway
22345,22346,where,to hendaye and then to paris to see about artists for the book,hemingway
22347,22348,really,yes,hemingway
22349,22350,i think i should,we ve wasted time as it is and today i made so much progress that i just need to keep on,hemingway
22351,22352,how are you going,with the bug,hemingway
22353,22354,you should nt drive alone,i want to,hemingway
22355,22356,you should nt devil,really,hemingway
22357,22358,i could nt let you,can i go on the train,hemingway
22359,22360,there s one to bayonne,i can rent a car there or in biarritz,hemingway
22361,22362,can we talk about it in the morning,i want to talk about it now,hemingway
22363,22364,you should nt go devil,i m going she said,hemingway
22365,22366,you re not going to stop me,i m only thinking about the best way,hemingway
22367,22368,no you re not,you re trying to stop me,hemingway
22369,22370,if you wait we ll go together,i do nt want to go together,hemingway
22371,22372,i want to go tomorrow and in the bug,if you do nt agree i ll go by train,hemingway
22373,22374,you ca nt stop anyone from going on the train,i m of age and because i m married to you does nt make me your slave or your chattel,hemingway
22375,22376,i m going and you ca nt stop me,will you be coming back,hemingway
22377,22378,i plan to,i see,hemingway
22379,22380,you do nt see but it does nt make any difference,this is a reasoned and coordinated project,hemingway
22381,22382,these things are nt just tossed into a wastebasket david said and remembered the discipline and sipped the whiskey and perrier,are you going to see your lawyers in paris,hemingway
22383,22384,he asked,if i have any business with them,hemingway
22385,22386,i usually see my lawyers,just because you do nt have any lawyers does nt mean everyone else does nt have to see their lawyers,hemingway
22387,22388,do you want my lawyers to do anything for you,no david said,hemingway
22389,22390,fuck your lawyers,do you have plenty of money,hemingway
22391,22392,i m quite all right on money,really david,hemingway
22393,22394,were nt the stories worth a lot,it s bothered me terribly and i know my responsibility,hemingway
22395,22396,i ll find out and do exactly what i should,you ll what,hemingway
22397,22398,do exactly what i should,just what is it you propose to do,hemingway
22399,22400,i ll have their value determined and i ll have twice that paid into your bank,sounds very generous david said,hemingway
22401,22402,you were always generous,i want to be just david and it s possible that they were worth financially much more than they would be appraised at,hemingway
22403,22404,who appraises these things,there must be people who do,hemingway
22405,22406,there are people who appraise everything,what sort of people,hemingway
22407,22408,i would nt know david,but i can imagine such people as the editor of the atlantic monthly harper s la nouvelle revue francaise,hemingway
22409,22410,i m going out for a while david said,do you feel all right,hemingway
22411,22412,except for the fact that i feel i ve probably done a great wrong to you that i must try to set right i feel very well catherine said,that was one reason i was going to paris,hemingway
22413,22414,i did nt want to tell you,let s not discuss casualties david said,hemingway
22415,22416,so you want to go on the train,no,hemingway
22417,22418,i want to go in the bug,all right,hemingway
22419,22420,go in the bug,just drive carefully and do nt pass on hills,hemingway
22421,22422,i ll drive the way you taught me and i ll pretend you re with me all the time and talk to you and tell us stories and make up stories about how i saved your life,i always make those up,hemingway
22423,22424,and with you it will all seem so much shorter and effortless and the speed wo nt seem fast,i m going to have fun,hemingway
22425,22426,good said david,take it as easy as you can,hemingway
22427,22428,sleep at nimes the first night unless you get off early,they know us at the imperator,hemingway
22429,22430,i thought i d get to carcassonne,no devil please,hemingway
22431,22432,perhaps i can get off early and make carcassonne,i d go by aries and montpellier and not lose time by nimes,hemingway
22433,22434,if you get off late stop at nîmes,it seems so babyish she said,hemingway
22435,22436,i ll drive with you he said,i should,hemingway
22437,22438,no please,it s important that i do this by myself,hemingway
22439,22440,it really is,i would nt have you,hemingway
22441,22442,all right he said,but i ought to go,hemingway
22443,22444,please do nt,you must have confidence in me david,hemingway
22445,22446,i ll drive carefully and i ll drive it right straight through,you could nt devil,hemingway
22447,22448,it gets dark early now,you must nt worry,hemingway
22449,22450,you re sweet to let me go catherine said,but you always did,hemingway
22451,22452,if i did anything i should nt i hope you can forgive me,i ll miss you terribly,hemingway
22453,22454,i miss you already,next time we ll drive it together,hemingway
22455,22456,you ve had a very busy day david said,you re tired,hemingway
22457,22458,at least let me run your bugatti down to town and back and give it a check,he stopped at marita s door and said do you want to go for a ride,hemingway
22459,22460,yes she said,come on then he told her,hemingway
22461,22462,he put the car at the road again until he saw the white painted bridge coming at him fast then held his speed as he calculated the distance raised his foot from the throttle and pumped the brakes gently,she was steady and lost momentum at each pump with no devia tion and no binding,hemingway
22463,22464,he brought the car to a stop before the bridge downshifted and then put her at the road again in a rising disciplined snarl along the to cannes,she burned them all he said,hemingway
22465,22466,oh david marita said and they drove on into cannes where the lights were on now and david stopped the car under the trees in front of the cafe where they had first met,would nt you rather go somewhere else,hemingway
22467,22468,marita asked,i do nt care david said,hemingway
22469,22470,it does nt make a hell of a lot of difference,no,hemingway
22471,22472,i d rather cool out david said,i just wanted to see if the car was in shape for her to drive it,hemingway
22473,22474,she s going,she says so,hemingway
22475,22476,the waiter had brought marita a tio pepe and david a whiskey and perrier,do you want me to go with her,hemingway
22477,22478,marita said,you do nt really think anything will happen to her,hemingway
22479,22480,no david,i think she s done her damage for a while,hemingway
22481,22482,could be david said,she burned every fucking thing except the narrative,hemingway
22483,22484,the stuff about her,it s a wonderful narrative marita said,hemingway
22485,22486,do nt buck me up david said,i wrote it and i wrote what she burned,hemingway
22487,22488,do nt give me the stuff they feed the troops,you can write them again,hemingway
22489,22490,no david told her,when it s right you ca nt remember,hemingway
22491,22492,every time you read it again it comes as a great and unbelievable surprise,you ca nt believe you did it,hemingway
22493,22494,when it s once right you never can do it again,you only do it once for each thing,hemingway
22495,22496,and you re only allowed so many in your life,so many what,hemingway
22497,22498,so many good ones,but you can remember them,hemingway
22499,22500,you must,not me and not you and not anybody,hemingway
22501,22502,they re gone,once i get them right they re gone,hemingway
22503,22504,she was wicked to you,no david said,hemingway
22505,22506,what then,hurried david said,hemingway
22507,22508,everything today was because she was hurried really,i hope you ll be as kind to me,hemingway
22509,22510,you just stay around and help me not to kill her,you know what she s going to do do nt you,hemingway
22511,22512,she s going to pay me for the stories so that i wo nt lose anything,no,hemingway
22513,22514,yes she is,truly david she did nt say that,hemingway
22515,22516,she said it and it s infinitely sound,only the details need working out and what s more the doubling of the appraisal or whatever makes it generous and gives her pleasure,hemingway
22517,22518,you ca nt let her drive alone david,i know it,hemingway
22519,22520,what are you going to do,i do nt know,hemingway
22521,22522,there is nt any hurry now,i think she s probably tired and gone to sleep,hemingway
22523,22524,i d like to go to sleep too with you and wake up and find the stuff all there and not gone and go to work again,we will sleep and someday when you wake up you ll work as wonderfully as you did this morning,hemingway
22525,22526,you re awfully good david said,i know what i got into,hemingway
22527,22528,sure said david,we both know,hemingway
22529,22530,do you want another drink,if you do marita said and then i did nt know it was a battle when i came,hemingway
22531,22532,neither did i,with you it s really only you against time,hemingway
22533,22534,not the time that s catherine s,only because her time is different,hemingway
22535,22536,she s panicked by it,you said tonight that all of today was only hurry,hemingway
22537,22538,that was nt true but it was perceptive,and you won so well over time for so long,hemingway
22539,22540,it was back as clear and unblurred as when he had first looked into the trash burner and seen the ashes that had been stirred by the broomstick,he pushed his headlights carefully out through the quiet and empty evening of the town and followed them along the port onto the road,hemingway
22541,22542,he felt marita s shoulder by him and heard her say i know david,it hit me too,hemingway
22543,22544,there s nothing to do but we ll do it,good,hemingway
22545,22546,toi et moi,she had a letter in her hand,hemingway
22547,22548,madame took the train for biarritz she said,she left this letter for monsieur,hemingway
22549,22550,when did she go,david asked,hemingway
22551,22552,immediately after monsieur and madame left madame aurol said,she sent the boy to the station for the ticket and to reserve a wagonlit,hemingway
22553,22554,david began reading the letter,what would you eat,hemingway
22555,22556,madame said,some cold chicken and a salad,hemingway
22557,22558,an omelette to start,there s lamb too if monsieur would rather,hemingway
22559,22560,what would he like madame,marita and madame aurol were talking together and david finished reading the letter,hemingway
22561,22562,he put it in his pocket and looked at madame aurol,did she seem herself when she left,hemingway
22563,22564,perhaps not monsieur,she ll be back david said,hemingway
22565,22566,yes monsieur,how strange,hemingway
22567,22568,but perhaps you have not been here very long,i ve been here long enough,hemingway
22569,22570,but it does have nice people in it,one must grant that,hemingway
22571,22572,georgette turned to me,you have nice friends,hemingway
22573,22574,frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came and lavigne with the liqueurs and after that we all went out and started for braddocks s dancingclub,the dancingclub was a bal musette in the rue de la montagne sainte genevieve,hemingway
22575,22576,five nights a week the working people of the pantheon quarter danced there,one night a week it was the dancingclub,hemingway
22577,22578,on monday nights it was closed,when we arrived it was quite empty except for a policeman sitting near the door the wife of the proprietor back of the zinc bar and the proprietor himself,hemingway
22579,22580,the daughter of the house came downstairs as we went in,there were long benches and tables ran across the room and at the far end a dancingfloor,hemingway
22581,22582,i wish people would come earlier braddocks said,the daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink,hemingway
22583,22584,the proprietor got up on a high stool beside the dancingfloor and began to play the accordion,he had a string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as he played,hemingway
22585,22586,every one danced,it was hot and we came off the floor perspiring,hemingway
22587,22588,my god georgette said,what a box to sweat in,hemingway
22589,22590,it s hot,hot my god,hemingway
22591,22592,take off your hat,that s a good idea,hemingway
22593,22594,some one asked georgette to dance and i went over to the bar,it was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night,hemingway
22595,22596,i drank a beer standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street,two taxis were coming down the steep street,hemingway
22597,22598,they both stopped in front of the bal,a crowd of young men some in jerseys and some in their shirtsleeves got out,hemingway
22599,22600,i could see their hands and newly washed wavy hair in the light from the door,the policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled,hemingway
22601,22602,they came in,as they went in under the light i saw white hands wavy hair white faces grimacing gesturing talking,hemingway
22603,22604,with them was brett,she looked very lovely and she was very much with them,hemingway
22605,22606,one of them saw georgette and said i do declare,there is an actual harlot,hemingway
22607,22608,i m going to dance with her lett,you watch me,hemingway
22609,22610,the tall dark one called lett said do nt you be rash,the wavy blond one answered do nt you worry dear,hemingway
22611,22612,and with them was brett,i was very angry,hemingway
22613,22614,somehow they always made me angry,i know they are supposed to be amusing and you should be tolerant but i wanted to swing on one any one anything to shatter that superior simpering composure,hemingway
22615,22616,instead i walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next bal,the beer was not good and i had a worse cognac to take the taste out of my mouth,hemingway
22617,22618,when i came back to the bad there was a crowd on the floor and georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth who danced bighippily carrying his head on one side his eyes lifted as he danced,as soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance,hemingway
22619,22620,she had been taken up by them,i knew then that they would all dance with her,hemingway
22621,22622,they are like that,i sat down at a table,hemingway
22623,22624,cohn was sitting there,frances was dancing,hemingway
22625,22626,mrs,braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as robert prentiss,hemingway
22627,22628,he was from new york by way of chicago and was a rising new novelist,he had some sort of an english accent,hemingway
22629,22630,i asked him to have a drink,thanks so much he said i ve just had one,hemingway
22631,22632,have another,thanks i will then,hemingway

22635,22636,yes,do you find paris amusing,hemingway
22637,22638,yes,really,hemingway
22639,22640,i was a little drunk,not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless,hemingway
22641,22642,for god s sake i said yes,do nt you,hemingway
22643,22644,oh how charmingly you get angry he said,i wish i had that faculty,hemingway
22645,22646,i got up and walked over toward the dancingfloor,mrs,hemingway
22647,22648,braddocks followed me,do nt be cross with robert she said,hemingway
22649,22650,he s still only a child you know,i was nt cross i said,hemingway
22651,22652,i just thought perhaps i was going to throw up,your fiancée is having a great success mrs,hemingway
22653,22654,braddocks looked out on the floor where georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall dark one called lett,is nt she,hemingway
22655,22656,i said,rather said mrs,hemingway
22657,22658,braddocks,cohn came up,hemingway
22659,22660,come on jake he said have a drink,we walked over to the bar,hemingway
22661,22662,what s the matter with you,you seem all worked up over something,hemingway
22663,22664,nothing,this whole show makes me sick is all,hemingway
22665,22666,brett came up to the bar,hello you chaps,hemingway
22667,22668,hello brett i said,why are nt you tight,hemingway
22669,22670,never going to get tight any more,i say give a chap a brandy and soda,hemingway
22671,22672,she stood holding the glass and i saw robert cohn looking at her,he looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land,hemingway
22673,22674,cohn of course was much younger,but he had that look of eager deserving expectation,hemingway
22675,22676,brett was damned goodlooking,she wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt and her hair was brushed back like a boy s,hemingway
22677,22678,she started all that,she was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht and you missed none of it with that wool jersey,hemingway

22747,22748,outside in the street we looked for a taxi,you re going to lose your fifty francs brett said,hemingway

22751,22752,we could walk up to the pantheon and get one,come on and we ll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one,hemingway
22753,22754,you would nt walk across the street,not if i could help it,hemingway
22755,22756,we went into the next bar and i sent a waiter for a taxi,well i said we re out away from them,hemingway
22757,22758,we stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other,the waiter came and said the taxi was outside,hemingway
22759,22760,brett pressed my hand hard,i gave the waiter a franc and we went out,hemingway
22761,22762,where should i tell him,i asked,hemingway
22763,22764,oh tell him to drive around,i told the driver to go to the parc montsouris and got in and slammed the door,hemingway
22765,22766,brett was leaning back in the corner her eyes closed,i sat beside her,hemingway
22767,22768,the cab started with a jerk,oh darling i ve been so miserable brett said,hemingway
22769,22770,etienne du mont went smoothly down the asphalt passed the trees and the standing bus at the place de la contrescarpe then turned onto the cobbles of the rue mouffetard,there were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street,hemingway
22771,22772,we were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street,brett s hat was off,hemingway
22773,22774,her head was back,i saw her face in the lights from the open shops then it was dark then i saw her face clearly as we came out on the avenue des gobelins,hemingway
22775,22776,the street was torn up and men were working on the cartracks by the light of acetylene flares,brett s face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares,hemingway
22777,22778,the street was dark again and i kissed her,our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat as far away as she could get,hemingway
22779,22780,her head was down,do nt touch me she said,hemingway
22781,22782,please do nt touch me,what s the matter,hemingway
22783,22784,i ca nt stand it,oh brett,hemingway

22791,22792,i simply turn all to jelly when you touch me,is nt there anything we can do about it,hemingway
22793,22794,she was sitting up now,my arm was around her and she was leaning back against me and we were quite calm,hemingway
22795,22796,she was looking into my eyes with that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw out of her own eyes,they would look on and on after every one else s eyes in the world would have stopped looking,hemingway
22797,22798,she looked as though there were nothing on earth she would not look at like that and really she was afraid of so many things,and there s not a damn thing we could do i said,hemingway
22799,22800,i do nt know she said,i do nt want to go through that hell again,hemingway
22801,22802,we d better keep away from each other,but darling i have to see you,hemingway
22803,22804,it is nt all that you know,no but it always gets to be,hemingway
22805,22806,that s my fault,do nt we pay for all the things we do though,hemingway
22807,22808,she had been looking into my eyes all the time,her eyes had different depths sometimes they seemed perfectly flat,hemingway
22809,22810,now you could see all the way into them,when i think of the hell i ve put chaps through,hemingway
22811,22812,i m paying for it all now,do nt talk like a fool i said,hemingway
22813,22814,besides what happened to me is supposed to be funny,i never think about it,hemingway
22815,22816,oh no,i ll lay you do nt,hemingway
22817,22818,well let s shut up about it,i laughed about it too myself once,hemingway
22819,22820,she was nt looking at me,a friend of my brother s came home that way from mons,hemingway
22821,22822,it seemed like a hell of a joke,chaps never know anything do they,hemingway
22823,22824,no i said,nobody ever knows anything,hemingway
22825,22826,i was pretty well through with the subject,at one time or another i had probably considered it from most of its various angles including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them,hemingway
22827,22828,it s funny i said,it s very funny,hemingway
22829,22830,and it s a lot of fun too to be in love,do you think so,hemingway
22831,22832,her eyes looked flat again,i do nt mean fun that way,hemingway
22833,22834,in a way it s an enjoyable feeling,no she said,hemingway
22835,22836,i think it s hell on earth,it s good to see each other,hemingway
22837,22838,no,i do nt think it is,hemingway
22839,22840,do nt you want to,i have to,hemingway
22841,22842,we were sitting now like two strangers,on the right was the parc montsouris,hemingway
22843,22844,the restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark,the driver leaned his head around,hemingway
22845,22846,where do you want to go,i asked,hemingway
22847,22848,brett turned her head away,oh go to the select,hemingway
22849,22850,café select i told the driver,boulevard montparnasse,hemingway
22851,22852,we drove straight down turning around the lion de belfort that guards the passing montrouge trams,brett looked straight ahead,hemingway
22853,22854,on the boulevard raspail with the lights of montparnasse in sight brett said would you mind very much if i asked you to do something,do nt be silly,hemingway
22855,22856,kiss me just once more before we get there,when the taxi stopped i got out and paid,hemingway
22857,22858,brett came out putting on her hat,she gave me her hand as she stepped down,hemingway
22859,22860,her hand was shaky,i say do i look too much of a mess,hemingway
22861,22862,she pulled her man s felt hat down and started in for the bar,inside against the bar and at tables were most of the crowd who had been at the dance,hemingway
22863,22864,hello you chaps brett said,i m going to have a drink,hemingway
22865,22866,oh brett,brett,hemingway

22929,22930,letter today,good night sir said the count,hemingway
22931,22932,i went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the boulevard st,michel passed the tables of the rotonde still crowded looked across the street at the dome its tables running out to the edge of the pavement,hemingway
22933,22934,some one waved at me from a table i did not see who it was and went on,i wanted to get home,hemingway
22935,22936,the boulevard montparnasse was deserted,lavigne s was closed tight and they were stacking the tables outside the closerie des lilas,hemingway
22937,22938,i passed ney s statue standing among the newleaved chestnuttrees in the arclight,there was a faded purple wreath leaning against the base,hemingway
22939,22940,i stopped and read the inscription from the bonapartist groups some date i forget,he looked very fine marshal ney in his topboots gesturing with his sword among the green new horsechestnut leaves,hemingway
22941,22942,my flat was just across the street a little way down the boulevard st,michel,hemingway
22943,22944,there was a light in the concierge s room and i knocked on the door and she gave me my mail,i wished her good night and went upstairs,hemingway
22945,22946,there were two letters and some papers,i looked at them under the gaslight in the diningroom,hemingway
22947,22948,the letters were from the states,one was a bank statement,hemingway
22949,22950,it showed a balance of,i got out my checkbook and deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month and discovered i had a balance of,hemingway
22951,22952,i wrote this on the back of the statement,the other letter was a wedding announcement,hemingway
22953,22954,mr,and mrs,hemingway
22955,22956,aloysius kirby announce the marriage of their daughter knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying,they must be circularizing the town,hemingway
22957,22958,it was a funny name,i felt sure i could remember anybody with a name like aloysius,hemingway
22959,22960,it was a good catholic name,there was a crest on the announcement,hemingway
22961,22962,like zizi the greek duke,and that count,hemingway
22963,22964,the count was funny,brett had a title too,hemingway
22965,22966,lady ashley,to hell with brett,hemingway
22967,22968,to hell with you lady ashley,i lit the lamp beside the bed turned off the gas and opened the wide windows,hemingway
22969,22970,the bed was far back from the windows and i sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed,outside a night train running on the streetcar tracks went by carrying vegetables to the markets,hemingway
22971,22972,they were noisy at night when you could not sleep,undressing i looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed,hemingway
22973,22974,that was a typically french way to furnish a room,practical too i suppose,hemingway
22975,22976,of all the ways to be wounded,i suppose it was funny,hemingway
22977,22978,i put on my pajamas and got into bed,i had the two bullfight papers and i took their wrappers off,hemingway
22979,22980,one was orange,the other yellow,hemingway
22981,22982,they would both have the same news so whichever i read first would spoil the other,le toril was the better paper so i started to read it,hemingway
22983,22984,i read it all the way through including the petite correspondance and the cornigrams,i blew out the lamp,hemingway
22985,22986,perhaps i would be able to sleep,my head started to work,hemingway
22987,22988,the old grievance,well it was a rotten way to be wounded and flying on a joke front like the italian,hemingway
22989,22990,in the italian hospital we were going to form a society,it had a funny name in italian,hemingway
22991,22992,i wonder what became of the others the italians,that was in the ospedale maggiore in milano padiglione ponte,hemingway
22993,22994,the next building was the padiglione zonda,there was a statue of ponte or maybe it was zonda,hemingway
22995,22996,that was where the liaison colonel came to visit me,that was funny,hemingway
22997,22998,that was about the first funny thing,i was all bandaged up,hemingway
22999,23000,but they had told him about it,then he made that wonderful speech you a foreigner an englishman any foreigner was an englishman have given more than your life,hemingway
23001,23002,what a speech,i would like to have it illuminated to hang in the office,hemingway
23003,23004,he never laughed,he was putting himself in my place i guess,hemingway
23005,23006,che mala fortuna,che mala fortuna,hemingway
23007,23008,i never used to realize it i guess,i try and play it along and just not make trouble for people,hemingway
23009,23010,probably i never would have had any trouble if i had nt run into brett when they shipped me to england,i suppose she only wanted what she could nt have,hemingway
23011,23012,well people were that way,to hell with people,hemingway
23013,23014,the catholic church had an awfully good way of handling all that,good advice anyway,hemingway
23015,23016,not to think about it,oh it was swell advice,hemingway
23017,23018,try and take it sometime,try and take it,hemingway
23019,23020,i lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around,then i could nt keep away from it and i started to think about brett and all the rest of it went away,hemingway
23021,23022,i was thinking about brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves,then all of a sudden i started to cry,hemingway
23023,23024,then after a while it was better and i lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street and then i went to sleep,i woke up,hemingway
23025,23026,there was a row going on outside,i listened and i thought i recognized a voice,hemingway
23027,23028,i put on a dressinggown and went to the door,the concierge was talking downstairs,hemingway
23029,23030,she was very angry,i heard my name and called down the stairs,hemingway
23031,23032,is that you monsieur barnes,the concierge called,hemingway
23033,23034,yes,it s me,hemingway

23037,23038,she says she must see you,i ve told her you re asleep,hemingway
23039,23040,then i heard brett s voice,half asleep i had been sure it was georgette,hemingway
23041,23042,i do nt know why,she could not have known my address,hemingway
23043,23044,will you send her up please,brett came up the stairs,hemingway

23133,23134,going to drive me around and have breakfast in the bois,hampers,hemingway
23135,23136,got it all at zelli s,dozen bottles of mumms,hemingway
23137,23138,tempt you,i have to work in the morning i said,hemingway
23139,23140,i m too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun,do nt be an ass,hemingway
23141,23142,ca nt do it,right,hemingway
23143,23144,send him a tender message,anything,hemingway
23145,23146,absolutely,good night darling,hemingway
23147,23148,do nt be sentimental,you make me ill,hemingway
23149,23150,we kissed good night and brett shivered,i d better go she said,hemingway
23151,23152,good night darling,you do nt have to go,hemingway
23153,23154,yes,we kissed again on the stairs and as i called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door,hemingway
23155,23156,i went back upstairs and from the open window watched brett walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arclight,she got in and it started off,hemingway
23157,23158,i turned around,on the table was an empty glass and a glass halffull of brandy and soda,hemingway
23159,23160,i took them both out to the kitchen and poured the halffull glass down the sink,i turned off the gas in the diningroom kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed and got into bed,hemingway
23161,23162,this was brett that i had felt like crying about,then i thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car as i had last seen her and of course in a little while i felt like hell again,hemingway
23163,23164,it is awfully easy to be hardboiled about everything in the daytime but at night it is another thing,it was a fine morning,hemingway
23165,23166,the horsechestnut trees in the luxembourg gardens were in bloom,there was the pleasant earlymorning feeling of a hot day,hemingway
23167,23168,i read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette,the flowerwomen were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock,hemingway
23169,23170,students went by going up to the law school or down to the sorbonne,the boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work,hemingway
23171,23172,i got on an s bus and rode down to the madeleine standing on the back platform,from the madeleine i walked along the boulevard des capucines to the opéra and up to my office,hemingway
23173,23174,i passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys,i stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers,hemingway
23175,23176,she was standing looking away the thread in her folded hands,the man was urging two tourists to buy,hemingway
23177,23178,three more tourists had stopped and were watching,i walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name cinzano on the sidewalk in damp letters,hemingway
23179,23180,all along people were going to work,it felt pleasant to be going to work,hemingway
23181,23182,i walked across the avenue and turned in to my office,upstairs in the office i read the french morning papers smoked and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning s work,hemingway
23183,23184,at eleven oclock i went over to the quai dorsay in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents while the foreignoffice mouthpiece a young nouvelle revue francaise diplomat in hornrimmed spectacles talked and answered questions for half an hour,the president of the council was in lyons making a speech or rather he was on his way back,hemingway
23185,23186,several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers,there was no news,hemingway
23187,23188,i shared a taxi back from the quai dorsay with woolsey and krum,what do you do nights jake,hemingway
23189,23190,asked krum,i never see you around,hemingway
23191,23192,oh i m over in the quarter,i m coming over some night,hemingway

23211,23212,i ve been thinking some about getting a car next year,i banged on the glass,hemingway
23213,23214,the chauffeur stopped,here s my street i said,hemingway
23215,23216,come in and have a drink,thanks old man krum said,hemingway
23217,23218,woolsey shook his head,i ve got to file that line he got off this morning,hemingway

23229,23230,i went to the office in the elevator,robert cohn was waiting for me,hemingway
23231,23232,hello jake he said,going out to lunch,hemingway
23233,23234,yes,let me see if there is anything new,hemingway
23235,23236,where will we eat,anywhere,hemingway
23237,23238,i was looking over my desk,where do you want to eat,hemingway
23239,23240,how about wetzel s,they ve got good hors doeuvres,hemingway
23241,23242,in the restaurant we ordered hors doeuvres and beer,the sommelier brought the beer tall beaded on the outside of the stems and cold,hemingway
23243,23244,there were a dozen different dishes of hors doeuvres,have any fun last night,hemingway
23245,23246,i asked,no,hemingway
23247,23248,i do nt think so,how s the writing going,hemingway
23249,23250,rotten,i ca nt get this second book going,hemingway
23251,23252,that happens to everybody,oh i m sure of that,hemingway
23253,23254,it gets me worried though,thought any more about going to south america,hemingway
23255,23256,i mean that,well why do nt you start off,hemingway
23257,23258,frances,well i said take her with you,hemingway
23259,23260,she would nt like it,that is nt the sort of thing she likes,hemingway
23261,23262,she likes a lot of people around,tell her to go to hell,hemingway
23263,23264,i ca nt,i ve got certain obligations to her,hemingway
23265,23266,he shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring,what do you know about lady brett ashley jake,hemingway
23267,23268,her name s lady ashley,brett s her own name,hemingway
23269,23270,she s a nice girl i said,she s getting a divorce and she s going to marry mike campbell,hemingway
23271,23272,he s over in scotland now,why,hemingway
23273,23274,she s a remarkably attractive woman,is nt she,hemingway
23275,23276,there s a certain quality about her a certain fineness,she seems to be absolutely fine and straight,hemingway
23277,23278,she s very nice,i do nt know how to describe the quality cohn said,hemingway
23279,23280,i suppose it s breeding,you sound as though you liked her pretty well,hemingway
23281,23282,i do,i should nt wonder if i were in love with her,hemingway
23283,23284,she s a drunk i said,she s in love with mike campbell and she s going to marry him,hemingway
23285,23286,he s going to be rich as hell some day,i do nt believe she ll ever marry him,hemingway
23287,23288,why not,i do nt know,hemingway
23289,23290,i just do nt believe it,have you known her a long time,hemingway
23291,23292,yes i said,she was a v a d in a hospital i was in during the war,hemingway
23293,23294,she must have been just a kid then,she s thirtyfour now,hemingway
23295,23296,when did she marry ashley,during the war,hemingway
23297,23298,her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery,you talk sort of bitter,hemingway
23299,23300,sorry,i did nt mean to,hemingway
23301,23302,i was just trying to give you the facts,i do nt believe she would marry anybody she did nt love,hemingway
23303,23304,well i said,she s done it twice,hemingway
23305,23306,i do nt believe it,well i said do nt ask me a lot of fool questions if you do nt like the answers,hemingway
23307,23308,i did nt ask you that,you asked me what i knew about brett ashley,hemingway
23309,23310,i did nt ask you to insult her,oh go to hell,hemingway
23311,23312,he stood up from the table his face white and stood there white and angry behind the little plates of hors dceuvres,sit down i said,hemingway
23313,23314,do nt be a fool,you ve got to take that back,hemingway
23315,23316,oh cut out the prepschool stuff,take it back,hemingway
23317,23318,sure,anything,hemingway
23319,23320,i never heard of brett ashley,how s that,hemingway
23321,23322,no,not that,hemingway
23323,23324,about me going to hell,oh do nt go to hell i said,hemingway
23325,23326,stick around,we re just starting lunch,hemingway
23327,23328,cohn smiled again and sat down,he seemed glad to sit down,hemingway
23329,23330,what the hell would he have done if he had nt sat down,you say such damned insulting things jake,hemingway
23331,23332,i m sorry,i ve got a nasty tongue,hemingway
23333,23334,i never mean it when i say nasty things,i know it cohn said,hemingway
23335,23336,you re really about the best friend i have jake,god help you i thought,hemingway
23337,23338,forget what i said i said out loud,i m sorry,hemingway
23339,23340,it s all right,it s fine,hemingway
23341,23342,i was just sore for a minute,good,hemingway
23343,23344,let s get something else to eat,after we finished the lunch we walked up to the café de la paix and had coffee,hemingway
23345,23346,i could feel cohn wanted to bring up brett again but i held him off it,we talked about one thing and another and i left him to come to the office,hemingway
23347,23348,she was not there so i sat down and wrote some letters,they were not very good letters but i hoped their being on crillon stationery would help them,hemingway
23349,23350,brett did not turn up so about quarter to six i went down to the bar and had a jack rose with george the barman,brett had not been in the bar either and so i looked for her upstairs on my way out and took a taxi to the café select,hemingway
23351,23352,crossing the seine i saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current riding high the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge,the river looked nice,hemingway
23353,23354,it was always pleasant crossing bridges in paris,the taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in doing same and turned up the boulevard raspail and i sat back to let that part of the ride pass,hemingway
23355,23356,the boulevard raspail always made dull riding,it was like a certain stretch on the plm,hemingway
23357,23358,between fontainebleau and montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and dull until it was over,i suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey,hemingway
23359,23360,there are other streets in paris as ugly as the boulevard raspail,it is a street i do not mind walking down at all,hemingway
23361,23362,but i can not stand to ride along it,perhaps i had read something about it once,hemingway
23363,23364,that was the way robert cohn was about all of paris,i wondered where cohn got that incapacity to enjoy paris,hemingway
23365,23366,possibly from mencken,mencken hates paris i believe,hemingway
23367,23368,so many young men get their likes and dislikes from mencken,the taxi stopped in front of the rotonde,hemingway
23369,23370,no matter what café in montparnasse you ask a taxidriver to bring you to from the right bank of the river they always take you to the rotonde,ten years from now it will probably be the dome,hemingway
23371,23372,it was near enough anyway,i walked past the sad tables of the rotonde to the select,hemingway
23373,23374,there were a few people inside at the bar and outside alone sat harvey stone,he had a pile of saucers in front of him and he needed a shave,hemingway
23375,23376,sit down said harvey i ve been looking for you,what s the matter,hemingway
23377,23378,nothing,just looking for you,hemingway
23379,23380,been out to the races,no,hemingway
23381,23382,not since sunday,what do you hear from the states,hemingway
23383,23384,nothing,absolutely nothing,hemingway
23385,23386,what s the matter,i do nt know,hemingway
23387,23388,i m through with them,i m absolutely through with them,hemingway
23389,23390,he leaned forward and looked me in the eye,do you want to know something jake,hemingway
23391,23392,yes,i have nt had anything to eat for five days,hemingway
23393,23394,i figured rapidly back in my mind,it was three days ago that harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the new york bar,hemingway
23395,23396,what s the matter,no money,hemingway
23397,23398,money has nt come he paused,i tell you it s strange jake,hemingway
23399,23400,when i m like this i just want to be alone,i want to stay in my own room,hemingway
23401,23402,i m like a cat,i felt in my pocket,hemingway
23403,23404,would a hundred help you any harvey,yes,hemingway
23405,23406,come on,let s go and eat,hemingway
23407,23408,there s no hurry,have a drink,hemingway
23409,23410,better eat,no,hemingway
23411,23412,when i get like this i do nt care whether i eat or not,we had a drink,hemingway
23413,23414,harvey added my saucer to his own pile,do you know mencken harvey,hemingway
23415,23416,yes,why,hemingway
23417,23418,what s he like,he s all right,hemingway
23419,23420,he says some pretty funny things,last time i had dinner with him we talked about hoffenheimer,hemingway
23421,23422,the trouble is he said he s a garter snapper,that s not bad,hemingway
23423,23424,that s not bad,he s through now harvey went on,hemingway
23425,23426,he s written about all the things he knows and now he s on all the things he does nt know,i guess he s all right i said,hemingway
23427,23428,i just ca nt read him,oh nobody reads him now harvey said except the people that used to read the alexander hamilton institute,hemingway
23429,23430,well i said,that was a good thing too,hemingway
23431,23432,sure said harvey,so we sat and thought deeply for a while,hemingway
23433,23434,have another port,all right said harvey,hemingway
23435,23436,there comes cohn i said,robert cohn was crossing the street,hemingway
23437,23438,that moron said harvey,cohn came up to our table,hemingway
23439,23440,hello you bums he said,hello robert harvey said,hemingway
23441,23442,i was just telling jake here that you re a moron,what do you mean,hemingway
23443,23444,tell us right off,do nt think,hemingway
23445,23446,what would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted,cohn started to consider,hemingway
23447,23448,do nt think,bring it right out,hemingway
23449,23450,i do nt know cohn said,what s it all about anyway,hemingway
23451,23452,i mean what would you rather do,what comes into your head first,hemingway
23453,23454,no matter how silly it is,i do nt know cohn said,hemingway
23455,23456,i think i d rather play football again with what i know about handling myself now,i misjudged you harvey said,hemingway
23457,23458,you re not a moron,you re only a case of arrested development,hemingway
23459,23460,you re awfully funny harvey cohn said,some day somebody will push your face in,hemingway
23461,23462,harvey stone laughed,you think so,hemingway
23463,23464,they wo nt though,because it would nt make any difference to me,hemingway
23465,23466,i m not a fighter,it would make a difference to you if anybody did it,hemingway
23467,23468,no it would nt,that s where you make your big mistake,hemingway
23469,23470,because you re not intelligent,cut it out about me,hemingway
23471,23472,sure said harvey,it does nt make any difference to me,hemingway
23473,23474,you do nt mean anything to me,come on harvey i said,hemingway
23475,23476,have another porto,no he said,hemingway
23477,23478,i m going up the street and eat,see you later jake,hemingway
23479,23480,he walked out and up the street,i watched him crossing the street through the taxis small heavy slowly sure of himself in the traffic,hemingway
23481,23482,he always gets me sore cohn said,i ca nt stand him,hemingway
23483,23484,i like him i said,i m fond of him,hemingway
23485,23486,you do nt want to get sore at him,i know it cohn said,hemingway
23487,23488,he just gets on my nerves,write this afternoon,hemingway
23489,23490,no,i could nt get it going,hemingway
23491,23492,it s harder to do than my first book,i m having a hard time handling it,hemingway
23493,23494,the sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from america early in the spring was gone,then he had been sure of his work only with these personal longings for adventure,hemingway
23495,23496,now the sureness was gone,somehow i feel i have not shown robert cohn clearly,hemingway
23497,23498,the reason is that until he fell in love with brett i never heard him make one remark that would in any way detach him from other people,he was nice to watch on the tenniscourt he had a good body and he kept it in shape he handled his cards well at bridge and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him,hemingway
23499,23500,if he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out,he wore what used to be called polo shirts at school and may be called that still but he was not professionally youthful,hemingway
23501,23502,i do not believe he thought about his clothes much,externally he had been formed at princeton,hemingway
23503,23504,internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him,he had a nice boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him and i probably have not brought it out,hemingway
23505,23506,he loved to win at tennis,he probably loved to win as much as lenglen for instance,hemingway
23507,23508,on the other hand he was not angry at being beaten,when he fell in love with brett his tennis game went all to pieces,hemingway
23509,23510,people beat him who had never had a chance with him,he was very nice about it,hemingway
23511,23512,anyhow we were sitting on the terrace of the café select and harvey stone had just crossed the street,come on up to the lilas i said,hemingway
23513,23514,i have a date,what time,hemingway
23515,23516,frances is coming here at sevenfifteen,there she is,hemingway
23517,23518,frances clyne was coming toward us from across the street,she was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement,hemingway
23519,23520,she waved and smiled,we watched her cross the street,hemingway
23521,23522,hello she said i m so glad you re here jake,i ve been wanting to talk to you,hemingway
23523,23524,hello frances said cohn,he smiled,hemingway
23525,23526,why hello robert,are you here,hemingway
23527,23528,she went on talking rapidly,i ve had the darndest time,hemingway
23529,23530,this one her head at did nt come home for lunch,i was nt supposed to,hemingway
23531,23532,oh i know,but you did nt say anything about it to the cook,hemingway
23533,23534,then i had a date myself and paula was nt at her office,oh went out of course,hemingway
23535,23536,she spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner,i always keep my appointments,hemingway
23537,23538,no one keeps theirs nowadays,i ought to know better,hemingway
23539,23540,how are you jake anyway,fine,hemingway
23541,23542,that was a fine girl you had at the dance and then went off with that brett one,do nt you like her,hemingway
23543,23544,cohn asked,i think she s perfectly charming,hemingway
23545,23546,do nt you,cohn said nothing,hemingway
23547,23548,look jake,i want to talk with you,hemingway
23549,23550,would you come over with me to the dome,you ll stay here wo nt you robert,hemingway
23551,23552,come on jake,we crossed the boulevard montparnasse and sat down at a table,hemingway
23553,23554,a boy came up with the paris times and i bought one and opened it,what s the matter frances,hemingway
23555,23556,oh nothing she said except that he wants to leave me,how do you mean,hemingway
23557,23558,oh he told every one that we were going to be married and i told my mother and every one and now he does nt want to do it,what s the matter,hemingway
23559,23560,he s decided he has nt lived enough,i knew it would happen when he went to new york,hemingway
23561,23562,she looked up very brighteyed and trying to talk inconsequentially,i would nt marry him if he does nt want to,hemingway
23563,23564,of course i would nt,i would nt marry him now for anything,hemingway
23565,23566,but it does seem to me to be a little late now after we ve waited three years and i ve just gotten my divorce,i said nothing,hemingway
23567,23568,we were going to celebrate so and instead we ve just had scenes,it s so childish,hemingway
23569,23570,we have dreadful scenes and he cries and begs me to be reasonable but he says he just ca nt do it,it s rotten luck,hemingway
23571,23572,i should say it is rotten luck,i ve wasted two years and a half on him now,hemingway
23573,23574,and i do nt know now if any man will ever want to marry me,two years ago i could have married anybody i wanted down at cannes,hemingway
23575,23576,all the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me,now i do nt think i could get anybody,hemingway
23577,23578,sure you could marry anybody,no i do nt believe it,hemingway
23579,23580,and i m fond of him too,and i d like to have children,hemingway
23581,23582,i always thought we d have children,she looked at me very brightly,hemingway
23583,23584,i never liked children much but i do nt want to think i ll never have them,i always thought i d have them and then like them,hemingway
23585,23586,he s got children,oh yes,hemingway
23587,23588,he s got children and he s got money and he s got a rich mother and he s written a book and nobody will publish my stuff nobody at all,it is nt bad either,hemingway
23589,23590,and i have nt got any money at all,i could have had alimony but i got the divorce the quickest way,hemingway
23591,23592,she looked at me again very brightly,it is nt right,hemingway
23593,23594,it s my own fault and it s not too,i ought to have known better,hemingway
23595,23596,and when i tell him he just cries and says he ca nt marry,why ca nt he marry,hemingway
23597,23598,i d be a good wife,i m easy to get along with,hemingway
23599,23600,i leave him alone,it does nt do any good,hemingway
23601,23602,it s a rotten shame,yes it is a rotten shame,hemingway
23603,23604,but there s no use talking about it is there,come on let s go back to the café,hemingway
23605,23606,and of course there is nt anything i can do,no,hemingway
23607,23608,just do nt let him know i talked to you,i know what he wants,hemingway
23609,23610,now for the first time she dropped her bright terribly cheerful manner,he wants to go back to new york alone and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it,hemingway
23611,23612,that s what he wants,maybe they wo nt like it,hemingway
23613,23614,i do nt think he s that way,really,hemingway
23615,23616,you do nt know him like i do jake,that s what he wants to do,hemingway
23617,23618,i know it,i know it,hemingway
23619,23620,that s why he does nt want to marry,he wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself,hemingway
23621,23622,want to go back to the café,yes,hemingway
23623,23624,come on,we got up from the had never brought us a and started across the street toward the select where cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marbletopped table,hemingway
23625,23626,well what are you smiling at,frances asked him,hemingway
23627,23628,feel pretty happy,i was smiling at you and jake with your secrets,hemingway
23629,23630,oh what i ve told jake is nt any secret,everybody will know it soon enough,hemingway
23631,23632,i only wanted to give jake a decent version,what was it,hemingway
23633,23634,about your going to england,yes about my going to england,hemingway
23635,23636,oh jake,i forgot to tell you,hemingway
23637,23638,i m going to england,is nt that fine,hemingway
23639,23640,yes that s the way it s done in the very best families,robert s sending me,hemingway
23641,23642,he s going to give me two hundred pounds and then i m going to visit friends,wo nt it be lovely,hemingway
23643,23644,the friends do nt know about it yet,she turned to cohn and smiled at him,hemingway
23645,23646,he was not smiling now,you were only going to give me a hundred pounds were nt you robert,hemingway
23647,23648,but i made him give me two hundred,he s really very generous,hemingway
23649,23650,are nt you robert,i do not know how people could say such terrible things to robert cohn,hemingway
23651,23652,there are people to whom you could not say insulting things,they give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed would actually be destroyed before your eyes if you said certain things,hemingway
23653,23654,but here was cohn taking it all,here it was all going on right before me and i did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it,hemingway
23655,23656,and this was friendly joking to what went on later,how can you say such things frances,hemingway
23657,23658,cohn interrupted,listen to him,hemingway
23659,23660,i m going to england,i m going to visit friends,hemingway
23661,23662,ever visit friends that did nt want you,oh they ll have to take me all right,hemingway
23663,23664,how do you do my dear,such a long time since we ve seen you,hemingway
23665,23666,and how is your dear mother,yes how is my dear mother,hemingway
23667,23668,she put all her money into french war bonds,yes she did,hemingway
23669,23670,probably the only person in the world that did,and what about robert,hemingway
23671,23672,or else very careful talking around robert,you must be most careful not to mention him my dear,hemingway
23673,23674,poor frances has had a most unfortunate experience,wo nt it be fun robert,hemingway
23675,23676,do nt you think it will be fun jake,she turned to me with that terribly bright smile,hemingway
23677,23678,it was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this,and where are you going to be robert,hemingway
23679,23680,it s my own fault all right,perfectly my own fault,hemingway
23681,23682,when i made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine i ought to have known you d get rid of me the same way,jake does nt know about that,hemingway
23683,23684,should i tell him,shut up frances for god s sake,hemingway
23685,23686,yes i ll tell him,robert had a little secretary on the magazine,hemingway
23687,23688,just the sweetest little thing in the world and he thought she was wonderful and then i came along and he thought i was pretty wonderful too,so i made him get rid of her and he had brought her to provincetown from carmel when he moved the magazine and he did nt even pay her fare back to the coast,hemingway
23689,23690,all to please me,he thought i was pretty fine then,hemingway
23691,23692,did nt you robert,you must nt misunderstand jake it was absolutely platonic with the secretary,hemingway
23693,23694,not even platonic,nothing at all really,hemingway
23695,23696,it was just that she was so nice,and he did that just to please me,hemingway
23697,23698,well i suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword,is nt that literary though,hemingway
23699,23700,you want to remember that for your next book robert,you know robert is going to get material for a new book,hemingway
23701,23702,are nt you robert,that s why he s leaving me,hemingway
23703,23704,he s decided i do nt film well,you see he was so busy all the time that we were living together writing on this book that he does nt remember anything about us,hemingway
23705,23706,so now he s going out and get some new material,well i hope he gets something frightfully interesting,hemingway
23707,23708,listen robert dear,let me tell you something,hemingway
23709,23710,you wo nt mind will you,do nt have scenes with your young ladies,hemingway
23711,23712,try not to,because you ca nt have scenes without crying and then you pity yourself so much you ca nt remember what the other person s said,hemingway
23713,23714,you ll never be able to remember any conversations that way,just try and be calm,hemingway
23715,23716,i know it s awfully hard,but remember it s for literature,hemingway
23717,23718,we all ought to make sacrifices for literature,look at me,hemingway
23719,23720,i m going to england without a protest,all for literature,hemingway
23721,23722,we must all help young writers,do nt you think so jake,hemingway
23723,23724,but you re not a young writer,are you robert,hemingway
23725,23726,you re thirtyfour,still i suppose that is young for a great writer,hemingway
23727,23728,look at hardy,look at anatole france,hemingway
23729,23730,he just died a little while ago,robert does nt think he s any good though,hemingway
23731,23732,some of his french friends told him,he does nt read french very well himself,hemingway
23733,23734,he was nt a good writer like you are was he robert,do you think he ever had to go and look for material,hemingway
23735,23736,what do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he would nt marry them,i wonder if he cried too,hemingway
23737,23738,oh i ve just thought of something,she put her gloved hand up to her lips,hemingway
23739,23740,i know the real reason why robert wo nt marry me jake,it s just come to me,hemingway
23741,23742,they ve sent it to me in a vision in the café select,is nt it mystic,hemingway
23743,23744,some day they ll put a tablet up,like at lourdes,hemingway
23745,23746,do you want to hear robert,i ll tell you,hemingway
23747,23748,it s so simple,i wonder why i never thought about it,hemingway
23749,23750,why you see robert s always wanted to have a mistress and if he does nt marry me why then he s had one,she was his mistress for over two years,hemingway
23751,23752,see how it is,and if he marries me like he s always promised he would that would be the end of all the romance,hemingway
23753,23754,do nt you think that s bright of me to figure that out,it s true too,hemingway
23755,23756,look at him and see if it s not,where are you going jake,hemingway
23757,23758,i ve got to go in and see harvey stone a minute,cohn looked up as i went in,hemingway
23759,23760,his face was white,why did he sit there,hemingway
23761,23762,why did he keep on taking it like that,as i stood against the bar looking out i could see them through the window,hemingway
23763,23764,frances was talking on to him smiling brightly looking into his face each time she asked is nt it so robert,or maybe she did not ask that now,hemingway
23765,23766,perhaps she said something else,i told the barman i did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door,hemingway
23767,23768,as i went out the door i looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and saw them sitting there,she was still talking to him,hemingway
23769,23770,i went down a side street to the boulevard raspail,a taxi came along and i got in and gave the driver the address of my flat,hemingway
23771,23772,she had some letters and a telegram,here is the post,hemingway
23773,23774,and there was a lady here to see you,did she leave a card,hemingway
23775,23776,no,she was with a gentleman,hemingway
23777,23778,it was the one who was here last night,in the end i find she is very nice,hemingway
23779,23780,was she with a friend of mine,i do nt know,hemingway
23781,23782,he was never here before,he was very large,hemingway
23783,23784,very very large,she was very nice,hemingway
23785,23786,very very nice,last night she was perhaps a she put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down,hemingway
23787,23788,i ll speak perfectly frankly monsieur barnes,last night i found her not so gentille,hemingway
23789,23790,last night i formed another idea of her,but listen to what i tell you,hemingway
23791,23792,she is très très gentille,she is of very good family,hemingway
23793,23794,it is a thing you can see,they did not leave any word,hemingway
23795,23796,yes,they said they would be back in an hour,hemingway
23797,23798,send them up when they come,yes monsieur barnes,hemingway
23799,23800,and that lady that lady there is some one,an eccentric perhaps but quelquune quelquune,hemingway
23801,23802,the concierge before she became a concierge had owned a drinkselling concession at the paris racecourses,her lifework lay in the pelouse but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage and she took great pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up which were of good family who were sportsmen a french word pronounced with the accent on the men,hemingway
23803,23804,the only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home chez barnes,one of my friends an extremely underfedlooking painter who was obviously to madame duzinell neither well brought up of good family nor a sportsman wrote me a letter asking if i could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings,hemingway
23805,23806,i went up to the flat wondering what brett had done to the concierge,the wire was a cable from bill gorton saying he was arriving on the france,hemingway
23807,23808,i put the mail on the table went back to the bedroom undressed and had a shower,i was rubbing down when i heard the doorbell pull,hemingway
23809,23810,i put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door,it was brett,hemingway
23811,23812,back of her was the count,he was holding a great bunch of roses,hemingway
23813,23814,hello darling said brett,are nt you going to let us in,hemingway
23815,23816,come on,i was just bathing,hemingway
23817,23818,are nt you the fortunate man,bathing,hemingway
23819,23820,only a shower,sit down count mippipopolous,hemingway
23821,23822,what will you drink,i do nt know whether you like flowers sir the count said but i took the liberty of just bringing these roses,hemingway
23823,23824,here give them to me,brett took them,hemingway
23825,23826,get me some water in this jake,i filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen and brett put the roses in it and placed them in the centre of the diningroom table,hemingway
23827,23828,i say,we have had a day,hemingway
23829,23830,you do nt remember anything about a date with me at the crillon,no,hemingway
23831,23832,did we have one,i must have been blind,hemingway
23833,23834,you were quite drunk my dear said the count,was nt i though,hemingway
23835,23836,and the count s been a brick absolutely,you ve got hell s own drag with the concierge now,hemingway
23837,23838,i ought to have,gave her two hundred francs,hemingway
23839,23840,do nt be a damned fool,his she said and nodded at the count,hemingway
23841,23842,i thought we ought to give her a little something for last night,it was very late,hemingway
23843,23844,he s wonderful brett said,he remembers everything that s happened,hemingway
23845,23846,so do you my dear,fancy said brett,hemingway
23847,23848,who d want to,i say jake do we get a drink,hemingway
23849,23850,you get it while i go in and dress,you know where it is,hemingway
23851,23852,rather,while i dressed i heard brett put down glasses and then a siphon and then heard them talking,hemingway
23853,23854,i dressed slowly sitting on the bed,i felt tired and pretty rotten,hemingway
23855,23856,brett came in the room a glass in her hand and sat on the bed,what s the matter darling,hemingway
23857,23858,do you feel rocky,she kissed me coolly on the forehead,hemingway
23859,23860,oh brett i love you so much,darling she said,hemingway
23861,23862,then do you want me to send him away,no,hemingway
23863,23864,he s nice,i ll send him away,hemingway
23865,23866,no do nt,yes i ll send him away,hemingway
23867,23868,you ca nt just like that,ca nt i though,hemingway
23869,23870,you stay here,he s mad about me i tell you,hemingway
23871,23872,she was gone out of the room,i lay face down on the bed,hemingway
23873,23874,i was having a bad time,i heard them talking but i did not listen,hemingway
23875,23876,brett came in and sat on the bed,poor old darling,hemingway
23877,23878,she stroked my head,what did you say to him,hemingway
23879,23880,i was lying with my face away from her,i did not want to see her,hemingway
23881,23882,sent him for champagne,he loves to go for champagne,hemingway
23883,23884,then later do you feel better darling,is the head any better,hemingway
23885,23886,it s better,lie quiet,hemingway
23887,23888,he s gone to the other side of town,could nt we live together brett,hemingway
23889,23890,could nt we just live together,i do nt think so,hemingway
23891,23892,i d just tromper you with everybody,you could nt stand it,hemingway
23893,23894,i stand it now,that would be different,hemingway
23895,23896,it s my fault jake,it s the way i m made,hemingway
23897,23898,could nt we go off in the country for a while,it would nt be any good,hemingway
23899,23900,i ll go if you like,but i could nt live quietly in the country,hemingway
23901,23902,not with my own true love,i know,hemingway
23903,23904,is nt it rotten,there is nt any use my telling you i love you,hemingway
23905,23906,you know i love you,let s not talk,hemingway
23907,23908,talking s all bilge,i m going away from you and then michael s coming back,hemingway
23909,23910,why are you going away,better for you,hemingway
23911,23912,better for me,when are you going,hemingway
23913,23914,soon as i can,where,hemingway
23915,23916,san sebastian,ca nt we go together,hemingway
23917,23918,no,that would be a hell of an idea after we d just talked it out,hemingway
23919,23920,we never agreed,oh you know as well as i do,hemingway
23921,23922,do nt he obstinate darling,oh sure i said,hemingway
23923,23924,i knowyou re right,i m just low and when i m low i talk like a fool,hemingway

23951,23952,he stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door,i think you ll find that s very good wine he said,hemingway
23953,23954,i know we do nt get much of a chance to judge good wine in the states now but i got this from a friend of mine that s in the business,oh you always have some one in the trade brett said,hemingway

23975,23976,let me take that stick,the count was looking at brett across the table under the gaslight,hemingway

24003,24004,you,got no affection nor gentleness for her,faulkner
24005,24006,you never had,we would be beholden to no man he says me and her,faulkner
24007,24008,we have never yet been and she will rest quieter for knowing it and that it was her own blood sawed out the boards and drove the nails,she was ever one to clean up after herself,faulkner

24017,24018,vernon spits neatly into the dust,by sundown now pa says,faulkner
24019,24020,i would not keep her waiting,jewel glances back then he goes on around the house,faulkner
24021,24022,i enter the hall hearing the voices before i reach the door,tilting a little down the hill as our house does a breeze draws through the hall all the time upslanting,faulkner
24023,24024,a feather dropped near the front door will rise and brush along the ceiling slanting backward until it reaches the downturning current at the back door so with voices,as you enter the hall they sound as though they were speaking out of the air about your head,faulkner
24025,24026,it was like he knew he would never see her again that anse bundren was driving him from his mother s death bed never to see her in this world again,i always said darl was different from those others,faulkner
24027,24028,i always said he was the only one of them that had his mother s nature had any natural affection,not that jewel the one she labored so to bear and coddled and petted so and him flinging into tantrums or sulking spells inventing devilment to devil her until i would have trailed him time and time,faulkner
24029,24030,not him to come and tell her goodbye,not him to miss a chance to make that extra three dollars at the price of his mother s goodbye kiss,faulkner
24031,24032,a bundren through and through loving nobody caring for nothing except how to get something with the least amount of work,mr tull says darl asked them to wait,faulkner
24033,24034,he said darl almost begged them on his knees not to force him to leave her in her condition,but nothing would do but anse and jewel must make that three dollars,faulkner
24035,24036,nobody that knows anse could have expected different but to think of that boy that jewel selling all those years of selfdenial and downright partiality they could nt fool me mr tull says mrs bundren liked jewel the least of all but i knew better,i knew she was partial to him to the same quality in him that let her put up with anse bundren when mr tull said she ought to poisoned him for three dollars denying his dying mother the goodbye mss,faulkner
24037,24038,why for the last three weeks i have been coming over every time i could coming sometimes when i should nt have neglecting my own family and duties so that somebody would be with her in her last moments and she would not have to face the great unknown without one familiar face to give her courage,not that i deserve credit for it i will expect the same for myself,faulkner
24039,24040,but thank god it will be the faces of my loved kin my blood and flesh for in my husband and children i have been more blessed than most trials though they have been at times,she lived a lonely woman lonely with her pride trying to make folks believe different hiding the fact that they just suffered her because she was not cold in the coffin before they were carting her forty miles away to bury her flouting the will of god to do it,faulkner
24041,24042,refusing to let her lie in the same earth with those bundrens,but she wanted to go mr tull said,faulkner
24043,24044,it was her own wish to lie among her own people,then why did nt she go alive,faulkner
24045,24046,i said,not one of them would have stopped her with even that little one almost old enough now to be selfish and stonehearted like the rest of them,faulkner
24047,24048,it was her own wish mr tull said,and you would believe anse of course i said,faulkner
24049,24050,a man like you would dont tell me,i d believe him about something he could nt expect to make anything off of me by not telling mr tull said,faulkner
24051,24052,dont tell me i said,a woman s place is with her husband and children alive or dead,faulkner
24053,24054,would you expect me to want to go back to alabama and leave you and the girls when my time comes that i left of my own will to cast my lot with yours for better and worse until death and after,well folks are different he said,faulkner
24055,24056,i should hope so,i have tried to live right in the sight of god and man for the honor and comfort of my christian husband and the love and respect of my christian children,faulkner
24057,24058,so that when i lay me down in the consciousness of my duty and reward i will be surrounded by loving faces carrying the farewell kiss of each of my loved ones into my reward,not like addie bundren dying alone hiding her pride and her broken heart,faulkner
24059,24060,glad to go,like as not if they had nt decided to make that last load they would have loaded her into the wagon on a quilt and crossed the river first and then stopped and give her time to die what christian death they would let her,faulkner
24061,24062,except darl,it was the sweetest thing i ever saw,faulkner
24063,24064,sometimes i lose faith in human nature for a time i am assailed by doubt,but always the lord restores my faith and reveals to me his bounteous love for his creatures,faulkner
24065,24066,not jewel the one she had always cherished not him,he was after that three extra dollars,faulkner
24067,24068,it was darl the one that folks say is queer lazy pottering about the place no better than anse with cash a good carpenter and always more building than he can get around to and jewel always doing something that made him some money or got him talked about and that nearnaked girl always standing over addie with a fan so that every time a body tried to talk to her and cheer her up would answer for her right quick like she was trying to keep anybody from coming near her at all,it was darl,faulkner
24069,24070,he come to the door and stood there looking at his dying mother,he just looked at her and i felt the bounteous love of the lord again and his mercy,faulkner
24071,24072,i saw that with jewel she had just been pretending but that it was between her and darl that the understanding and the true love was,he just looked at her not even coming in where she could see him and get upset knowing that anse was driving him away and he would never see her again,faulkner
24073,24074,he said nothing just looking at her,what you want darl,faulkner
24075,24076,dewey dell said not stopping the fan speaking up quick keeping even him from her,he did nt answer,faulkner
24077,24078,he just stood and looked at his dying mother his heart too full for words,pa dassent sweat because he will catch his death from the sickness so everybody that comes to help us,faulkner
24079,24080,and jewel dont care about anything he is not kin to us in caring not carekin,and cash like sawing the long hot sad yellow days up into planks and nailing them to something,faulkner
24081,24082,and pa thinks because neighbors will always treat one another that way because he has always been too busy letting neighbors do for him to find out,we picked on down the row the woods getting closer and closer and the secret shade picking on into the secret shade with my sack and lafe s sack,faulkner
24083,24084,because i said will i or wont i when the sack was half full because i said if the sack is full when we get to the woods it wont be me,i said if it dont mean for me to do it the sack will not be full and i will turn up the next row but if the sack is full i can not help it,faulkner
24085,24086,it will be that i had to do it all the time and i can not help it,and we picked on toward the secret shade and our eyes would drown together touching on his hands and my hands and i did nt say anything,faulkner
24087,24088,i said what are you doing,and he said i am picking into your sack,faulkner
24089,24090,and so it was full when we came to the end of the row and i could not help it,and so it was because i could not help it,faulkner
24091,24092,it was then and then i saw darl and he knew,he said he knew without the words like he told me that ma is going to die without words and i knew he knew because if he had said he knew with the words i would not have believed that he had been there and saw us,faulkner
24093,24094,but he said he did know and i said are you going to tell pa are you going to kill him,without the words i said it and he said why,faulkner
24095,24096,without the words,and that s why i can talk to him with knowing with hating because he knows,faulkner
24097,24098,he stands in the door looking at her,what you want darl,faulkner
24099,24100,i say,she is going to die he says,faulkner
24101,24102,and old turkeybuzzard tull coming to watch her die but i can fool them,when is she going to die,faulkner
24103,24104,i say,before we get back he says,faulkner
24105,24106,then why are you taking jewel,i say,faulkner
24107,24108,i want him to help me load he says,his overalls are faded on one knee a serge patch cut out of a pair of sunday pants wore ironslick,faulkner
24109,24110,no man mislikes it more than me he says,a fellow s got to guess ahead now and then i say,faulkner
24111,24112,but come long and short it wont be no harm done neither way,she ll want to get started right off he says,faulkner
24113,24114,it s far enough to jefferson at best,but the roads is good now i say,faulkner
24115,24116,it s fixing to rain tonight too,his folks buries at new hope too not three miles away,faulkner
24117,24118,but it s just like him to marry a woman born a day s hard ride away and have her die on him,he looks out over the land rubbing his knees,faulkner
24119,24120,no man so mislikes it he says,they ll get back in plenty of time i say,faulkner
24121,24122,i would nt worry none,it means three dollars he says,faulkner
24123,24124,might be it wont be no need for them to rush back noways i say,i hope it,faulkner
24125,24126,she s agoing he says,her mind is set on it,faulkner
24127,24128,it s a hard me on women for a fact,some women,faulkner
24129,24130,i mind my mammy lived to be seventy and more,worked every day rain or shine never a sick day since her last chap was born until one day she kind of looked around her and then she went and taken that lacetrimmed night gown she had had fortyfive years and never wore out of the chest and put it on and laid down on the bed and pulled the covers up and shut her eyes,faulkner
24131,24132,you all will have to look out for pa the best you can she said,i m tired,faulkner
24133,24134,anse rubs his hands on his knees,the lord giveth he says,faulkner
24135,24136,we can hear cash ahammering and sawing beyond the corner,it s true,faulkner

24145,24146,a hog,where d you get it,faulkner
24147,24148,down to the bridge he says,he turns it over the under side caked over with dust where it is wet the eye coated over humped under the dirt,faulkner
24149,24150,are you aiming to leave it laying there,anse says,faulkner
24151,24152,i aim to show it to ma vardaman says,he looks toward the door,faulkner
24153,24154,we can hear the talking coming out on the draft,cash too knocking and hammering at the boards,faulkner
24155,24156,there s company in there he says,just my folks i say,faulkner
24157,24158,they d enjoy to see it too,he says nothing watching the door,faulkner
24159,24160,then he looks down at the fish laying in the dust,he turns it over with his foot and prods at the eyebump with his toe gouging at it,faulkner
24161,24162,anse is looking out over the land,vardaman looks at anse s face then at the door,faulkner
24163,24164,he turns going toward the corner of the house when anse calls him without looking around,you clean that fish anse says,faulkner
24165,24166,vardaman stops,why cant dewey dell clean it,faulkner
24167,24168,he says,you clean that fish anse says,faulkner

24171,24172,he dont look around,vardaman comes back and picks up the fish,faulkner
24173,24174,it slides out of his hands smearing wet dirt onto him and flops down dirtying itself again gapmouthed goggleeyed hiding into the dust like it was ashamed of being dead like it was in a hurry to get back hid again,vardaman cusses it,faulkner
24175,24176,he cusses it like a grown man standing astraddle of it,anse dont look around,faulkner
24177,24178,vardaman picks it up again,he goes on around the house toting it in both arms like a armful of wood it overlapping him on both ends head and tail,faulkner
24179,24180,durn nigh big as he is,anse s wrists dangle out of his sleeves i never see him with a shirt on that looked like it was his in all my life,faulkner
24181,24182,they all looked like jewel might have give him his old ones,not jewel though,faulkner
24183,24184,he s longarmed even if he is spindling,except for the lack of sweat,faulkner
24185,24186,you could tell they aint been nobody else s but anse s that way without no mistake,his eyes look like pieces of bumtout cinder fixed in his face looking out over the land,faulkner
24187,24188,when the shadow touches the steps he says ifs five oclock,just as i get up cora comes to the door and says it s time to get on,faulkner
24189,24190,anse reaches for his shoes,now mr bundren cora says dont you get up now,faulkner
24191,24192,he puts his shoes on stomping into them like he does everything like he is hoping all the time he really cant do it and can quit trying to,when we go up the hall we can hear them clumping on the floor like they was iron shoes,faulkner
24193,24194,he comes toward the door where she is blinking his eyes kind of looking ahead of hisself before he sees like he is hoping to find her setting up in a chair maybe or maybe sweeping and looks into the door in that surprised way like he looks in and finds her still in bed every time and dewey dell still afanning her with the fan,he stands there like he dont aim to move again nor nothing else,faulkner
24195,24196,well i reckon we better get on cora says,i got to feed the chickens,faulkner
24197,24198,it s fixing to rain too,clouds like that dont lie and the cotton making every day the lord sends,faulkner
24199,24200,that ll be something else for him,cash is still trimming at the boards,faulkner
24201,24202,if there s ere a thing we can do cora says,ansell let us know i say,faulkner
24203,24204,anse dont look at us,he looks around blinking in that surprised way like he had wore hisself down being surprised and was even surprised at that,faulkner
24205,24206,i so hope it,her mind is set on it he says,faulkner
24207,24208,let the lord comfort you,about that corn i say,faulkner
24209,24210,i tell him again i will help him out if he gets into a tight with her sick and all,like most folks around here i done holp him so much already i cant quit now,faulkner
24211,24212,i aimed to get to it today he says,seems like i cant get my mind on nothing,faulkner
24213,24214,maybe she ll hold out till you are laidby i say,if god wills it he says,faulkner
24215,24216,let him comfort you cora says,if cash just works that careful on my barn,faulkner
24217,24218,he looks up when we pass,taint no rush i say,faulkner
24219,24220,whenever you get around to it,we get into the wagon,faulkner
24221,24222,cora sets the cake box on her lap,it s fixing to rain sho,faulkner
24223,24224,i dont know what he ll do cora says,i just dont know,faulkner
24225,24226,poor anse i say,she kept him at work for thirtyodd years,faulkner
24227,24228,i reckon she is tired,and i reckon she ll be behind him for thirty years more kate says,faulkner
24229,24230,or if it aint her hell get another one before cottonpicking,i reckon cash and darl can get married now eula says,faulkner
24231,24232,that poor boy cora says,the poor little tyke,faulkner
24233,24234,what about jewel,kate says,faulkner
24235,24236,he can too eula says,hmph kate says,faulkner
24237,24238,i reckon he will,i reckon so,faulkner
24239,24240,i reckon there s more gals than one around here that dont want to see jewel tied down,well they need nt to worry,faulkner
24241,24242,why kate,cora says,faulkner
24243,24244,the wagon begins to rattle,the poor little tyke cora says,faulkner
24245,24246,it s fixing to rain this night,yes sir,faulkner
24247,24248,a rattling wagon is mighty dry weather for a birdsell,but that ll be cured,faulkner
24249,24250,it will for a fact,she ought to taken them cakes after she said she would kate says,faulkner
24251,24252,and it fixing to rain too,i can stand here and same as see it with secondsight ashutting down behind them like a wall shutting down betwixt them and my given promise,faulkner
24253,24254,i do the best i can much as i can get my mind on anything but durn them boys,alaying there right tip to my door where every bad luck that comes and goes is bound to find it,faulkner
24255,24256,i told addie it want any luck living on a road when it come by here and she said for the world like a woman get up and move then,but i told her it want no luck in it because the lord put roads for travelling why he laid them down flat on the earth,faulkner
24257,24258,and so he never aimed for folks to live on a road because which gets there first i says the road or the house,did you ever know him to set a road down by a house,faulkner
24259,24260,i says,no you never i says because it s always men cant rest till they gets the house set where everybody that passes in a wagon can spit in the doorway keeping the folks restless and wanting to get up and go somewheres else when he aimed for them to stay put like a tree or a stand of corn,faulkner
24261,24262,because if he d a aimed for man to be always amoving and going somewheres else would nt he a put him longways on his belly like a snake,it stands to reason he would,faulkner
24263,24264,putting it where every bad luck prowling can find it and come straight to my door charging me taxes on top of it,making me pay for cash having to get them carpenter notions when if it had nt been no road come there he would nt a got them falling off of churches and lifting no hand in six months and me and addie slaving and aslaving when there s plenty of sawing on this place he could do if he s got to saw,faulkner
24265,24266,and darl too,talking me out of him durn them it aint that i am afraid of work i always is fed me and mine and kept a roof above us it s that they would shorthand me just because he tends to his own business just because he s got his eyes full of the land all the time,faulkner
24267,24268,i says to them he was all right at first with his eyes full of the land because the land laid upanddown ways then it was nt till that ere road come and switched the land around longways and his eyes still full of the land that they begun to threaten me out of him trying to shorthand me with the law,making me pay for it,faulkner
24269,24270,she was well and hale as ere a woman ever were except for that road,just laying down resting herself in her own bed asking naught of none,faulkner
24271,24272,are you sick addie,i said,faulkner
24273,24274,i am not sick she said,you lay you down and rest you i said,faulkner
24275,24276,i knowed you are not sick,you re just tired,faulkner
24277,24278,you lay you down and rest,i am not sick she said,faulkner
24279,24280,i will get up,lay still and rest i said,faulkner
24281,24282,you are just tired,you can get up tomorrow,faulkner
24283,24284,and she was laying there well and hale as ere a woman ever were except for that road,i never sent for you i said,faulkner
24285,24286,i take you to witness i never sent for you,i know you did nt peabody said,faulkner
24287,24288,i bound that,where is she,faulkner
24289,24290,she s alaying down i said,go set on the porch a while,faulkner
24291,24292,and now i got to pay for it me without a tooth in my head hoping to get ahead enough so i could get my mouth fixed where i could eat god s own victuals as a man should and her hale and well as ere a woman in the land until that day,got to pay for being put to the need of that three dollars,faulkner
24293,24294,got to pay for the way for them boys to have to go away to earn it,and now i can see same as second sight the rain shutting down betwixt us acoming up that road like a durn man like it want ere a other house to rain on in all the living land,faulkner
24295,24296,i nave heard men cuss their luck and right for they were sinful men,but i do not say it s a curse on me because i have done no wrong to be cussed by,faulkner
24297,24298,i am not religious i reckon,but peace is my heart i know it is,faulkner
24299,24300,i have done things but neither better nor worse than them that pretend otherlike and i know that old marster will care for me as for ere a sparrow that falls,but it seems hard that a man in his need could be so flouted by a road,faulkner
24301,24302,vardaman comes around the house bloody as a hog to his knees and that ere fish chopped up with the axe like as not or maybe throwed away for him to lie about the dogs et it,well i reckon i aint no call to expect no more of him than of his mangrowed brothers,faulkner
24303,24304,whew he says i m pure tired,go wash them hands i say,faulkner
24305,24306,it was full of blood and guts as a hog he says,go wash them hands i say,faulkner
24307,24308,but i just cant seem to get no heart into it,he has not once looked back,faulkner
24309,24310,jewel i say,back running tunnelled between the two sets of bobbing mule ears the road vanishes beneath the wagon as though it were a ribbon and the front axle were a spool,faulkner
24311,24312,do you know she is going to die jewel,it takes two people to make you and one people to die,faulkner
24313,24314,that s how the world is going to end,i said to dewey dell you want her to die so you can get to town is that it,faulkner
24315,24316,she would nt say what we both knew,the reason you will not say it is when you say it even to yourself you will know it is true is that it,faulkner
24317,24318,but you know it is true now,i can almost tell you the day when you knew it is true,faulkner
24319,24320,why wont you say it even to yourself,she will not say it,faulkner
24321,24322,she just keeps on saying are you going to tell pa,are you going to kill him,faulkner
24323,24324,you can not believe it is true because you can not believe that dewey dell dewey dell bundren could have such bad luck is that it,the sun an hour above the horizon is poised like a bloody egg upon a crest of thunderheads the light has turned copper in the eye portentous in the nose sulphurous smelling of lightning,faulkner
24325,24326,when peabody comes they will have to use the rope,he has pusselgutted himself eating cold greens,faulkner
24327,24328,with the rope they will haul him up the path balloonlike up the sulphurous air,jewel i say do you know that addie bundren is going to die,faulkner
24329,24330,addie bundren is going to die,and i said a damn good thing and at first i would not go because there might be something i could do and i would have to haul her back by god,faulkner
24331,24332,i thought maybe they have the same sort of fool ethics in heaven they have in the medical college and that it was maybe vernon lull sending for me again getting me there in the nick of time as vernom always does things getting the most for anse s money like he does for his own,but when it got far enough into the day for me to read weather sign i knew it could nt have been anybody but anse that sent,faulkner
24333,24334,i knew that nobody but a luckless man could ever need a doctor in the face of a cyclone,and i knew that if it had finally occurred to anse himself that he needed one it was already too late,faulkner
24335,24336,when i reach the spring and get down and hitch the team the sun has gone down behind a bank of black cloud like a topheavy mountain range like a load of cinders dumped over there and there is no wind,i could hear cash sawing for a mile before i got there,faulkner
24337,24338,anse is standing at the top of the bluff above the path,where s the horse,faulkner
24339,24340,i say,jewel s taken and gone he says,faulkner
24341,24342,cant nobody else ketch hit,you ll have to walk up i reckon,faulkner
24343,24344,me walk up weighing two hundred and twentyfive pounds,i say,faulkner
24345,24346,walk up that durn wall,he stands there beside a tree,faulkner
24347,24348,too bad the lord made the mistake of giving trees roots and giving the anse bundrens he makes feet and legs,if he d just swapped them there would nt ever be a worry about this country being deforested someday,faulkner
24349,24350,or any other country,what do you aim for me to do,faulkner
24351,24352,i say,stay here and get blowed clean out of the county when that cloud breaks,faulkner
24353,24354,even with the horse it would take me fifteen minutes to ride up across the pasture to the top of the ridge and reach the house,the path looks like a crooked limb blown against the bluff,faulkner
24355,24356,anse has not been in town in twelve years,and how his mother ever got up there to bear him he being his mother s son,faulkner
24357,24358,vardaman s gittin the rope he says,after a while vardaman appears with the plowline,faulkner
24359,24360,he gives the end of it to anse and comes down the path uncoiling it,you hold it tight i say,faulkner
24361,24362,i done already wrote this visit onto my books so i m going to charge you just the same whether i get there or not,i got hit anse says,faulkner
24363,24364,you kin come on up,i ll be damned if i can see why i dont quit,faulkner
24365,24366,a man seventy years old weighing two hundred and odd pounds being hauled up and down a damn mountain on a rope,i reckon it s because i must reach the fifty thousand dollar mark of dead accounts on my books before i can quit,faulkner
24367,24368,what the hell does your wife mean i say taking sick on top of a durn mountain,i m right sorry he says,faulkner
24369,24370,he let the rope go just dropped it and he has turned toward the house,there is a little daylight up here still of the color of sulphur matches,faulkner
24371,24372,the boards look like strips of sulphur,cash does not look back,faulkner
24373,24374,vernon tull says he brings each board up to the window for her to see it and say it is all right,the boy overtakes us,faulkner
24375,24376,anse looks back at him,where s the rope,faulkner
24377,24378,he says,it s where you left it i say,faulkner
24379,24380,but never you mind that rope,i got to get back down that bluff,faulkner
24381,24382,i dont aim for that storm to catch me up here,td blow too durn far once i got started,faulkner
24383,24384,the girl is standing by the bed fanning her,when we enter she turns her head and looks at us,faulkner
24385,24386,she has been dead these ten days,i suppose it s having been a part of anse for so long that she can not even make that change if change it be,faulkner
24387,24388,i can remember how when i was young i believed death to be a phenomenon of the body now i know it to be merely a function of the mind and that of the minds of the ones who suffer the bereavement,the nihilists say it is the end the fundamentalists the beginning when in reality it is no more than a single tenant or family moving out of a tenement or a town,faulkner
24389,24390,she looks at us,only her eyes seem to move,faulkner
24391,24392,it s like they touch us not with sight or sense but like the stream from a hose touches you the stream at the instant of impact as dissociated from the nozzle as though it had never been there,she does not look at anse at all,faulkner
24393,24394,she looks at me then at the boy,the girl does not stop the fan,faulkner
24395,24396,how are you sister,i say,faulkner
24397,24398,her head lies gaunt on the pillow looking at the boy,you picked out a fine time to get me out here and bring up a storm,faulkner
24399,24400,then i send anse and the boy out,she watches the boy as he leaves the room,faulkner
24401,24402,she has not moved save her eyes,he and anse are on the porch when i come out the boy sitting on the steps anse standing by a post not even leaning against it his arms dangling the hair pushed and matted up on his head like a dipped rooster,faulkner
24403,24404,he turns his head bunking at me,why did nt you send for me sooner,faulkner
24405,24406,i say,hit was jest one thing and then another he says,faulkner

24413,24414,the durn little tyke is sitting on the top step looking smaller than ever in the sulphurcolored light,that s the one trouble with this country everything weather all hangs on too long,faulkner
24415,24416,like our rivers our land opaque slow violent shaping and creating the me of man in its implacable and brooding image,i knowed hit anse says,faulkner
24417,24418,all the while i made sho,her mind is sot on hit,faulkner
24419,24420,and a damn good thing too i say,with a trifling he sits on the top step small motionless in faded overalls,faulkner
24421,24422,when i came out he looked up at me then at anse,but now he has stopped looking at us,faulkner
24423,24424,he just sits there,have you told her yit,faulkner
24425,24426,anse says,what for,faulkner
24427,24428,i say,what the devil for,faulkner
24429,24430,shell know hit,i knowed that when she see you she would know hit same as writing,faulkner
24431,24432,you would nt need to tell her,i look at her at her face,faulkner
24433,24434,you better go quick i say,when we enter the room she is watching the door,faulkner
24435,24436,she looks at me,her eyes look like lamps blaring up just before the oil is gone,faulkner
24437,24438,she wants you to go out the girl says,now addie anse says when he come all the way from jefferson to git you well,faulkner
24439,24440,she watches me i can feel her eyes,it s like she was shoving at me with them,faulkner
24441,24442,i have seen it before in women,seen them drive from the room them coming with sympathy and pity with actual help and clinging to some trifling animal to whom they never were more than packhorses,faulkner
24443,24444,that s what they mean by the love that passeth understanding that pride that furious desire to hide that abject nakedness which we bring here with us carry with us into operating rooms carry stubbornly and furiously with us into the earth again,i leave the room,faulkner
24445,24446,beyond the porch cash s saw snores steadily into the board,a minute later she calls his name her voice harsh and strong,faulkner
24447,24448,from behind his leg vardaman peers with his round head and his eyes round and his mouth beginning to open,she looks at pa all her failing life appears to drain into her eyes urgent irremediable,faulkner
24449,24450,it s jewel she wants dewey dell says,why addle pa says him and darl went to make one more load,faulkner
24451,24452,they thought there was time,that you would wait for them and that three dollars and all he stoops laying his hand on hers,faulkner
24453,24454,for a while yet she looks at him without reproach without anything at all as if her eyes alone are listening to the irrevocable cessation of his voice,dewey dell leans down trying to press her back,faulkner
24455,24456,ma she says ma,she is looking out the window at cash stooping steadily at the board in the failing light laboring on toward darkness and into it as though the stroking of the saw illumined its own motion board and saw engendered,faulkner
24457,24458,you cash she shouts her voice harsh strong and unimpaired,you cash,faulkner
24459,24460,he looks up at the gaunt face framed by the window in the twilight,it is a composite picture of all time since he was a child,faulkner
24461,24462,he drops the saw and lifts the board for her to see watching the window in which the face has not moved,he drags a second plank into position and slants the two of them into their final juxtaposition gesturing toward the ones yet on the ground shaping with his empty hand in pantomime the finished box,faulkner
24463,24464,for a while still she looks down at him from the composite picture neither with censure nor approbation,then the face disappears,faulkner
24465,24466,she lies back and turns her head without so much as glancing at pa,she looks at vardaman her eyes the life in them rushing suddenly upon them the two flames glare up for a steady instant,faulkner
24467,24468,then they go out as though someone had leaned down and blown upon them,ma dewey dell says ma,faulkner
24469,24470,leaning above the bed her hands lifted a little the fan still moving like it has for ten days she begins to keen,her voice is strong young tremulous and clear rapt with its own timbre and volume the fan still moving steadily up and down whispering the useless air,faulkner
24471,24472,he begins to move slowly backward from the bed his eyes round his pale face fading into the dusk like a piece of paper pasted on a failing wall and so out of the door,pa leans above the bed in the twilight his humped silhouette partaking of that owllike quality of awryfeathered disgruntled outrage within which lurks a wisdom too profound or too inert for even thought,faulkner
24473,24474,durn them boys he says,jewel i say,faulkner
24475,24476,overhead the day drives level and gray hiding the sun by a flight of gray spears,in the rain the mules smoke a little splashed yellow with mud the off one clinging in sliding lunges to the side of the road above the ditch,faulkner
24477,24478,the tilted lumber gleams dull yellow watersoaked and heavy as lead tilted at a steep angle into the ditch above the broken wheel about the shattered spokes and about jewel s ankles a runnel of yellow neither water nor earth swirls curving with the yellow road neither of earth nor water down the hill dissolving into a streaming mass of dark green neither of earth nor sky,jewel i say cash comes to the door carrying the saw,faulkner
24479,24480,pa stands beside the bed humped his arms dangling,he turns his head his shabby profile his chin collapsing slowly as he works the snuff against his gums,faulkner
24481,24482,she s gone cash says,she taken and left us pa says,faulkner
24483,24484,cash does not look at him,how nigh are you done,faulkner
24485,24486,pa says,cash does not answer,faulkner
24487,24488,he enters carrying the saw,i reckon you better get at it pa says,faulkner
24489,24490,you ll have to do the best you can with them boys gone off thataway,cash looks down at her face,faulkner
24491,24492,he is not listening to pa at all,he does not approach the bed,faulkner
24493,24494,he stops in the middle of the floor the saw against his leg his sweating arms powdered lightly with sawdust his face composed,if you get in a tight maybe some of themll get here tomorrow and help you pa says,faulkner
24495,24496,vernon could,cash is not listening,faulkner
24497,24498,he is looking down at her peaceful rigid face fading into the dusk as though darkness were a precursor of the ultimate earth until at last the face seems to float detached upon it lightly as the reflection of a dead leaf,there is christians enough to help you pa says,faulkner
24499,24500,cash is not listening,after a while he turns without looking at pa and leaves the room,faulkner
24501,24502,then the saw begins to snore again,they will help us in our sorrow pa says,faulkner
24503,24504,the sound of the saw is steady competent unhurried stirring the dying light so that at each stroke her face seems to wake a little into an expression of listening and of waiting as though she were counting the strokes,pa looks down at the face at the black sprawl of dewey dell s hair the outflung arms the clutched fan now motionless on the fading quilt,faulkner
24505,24506,i reckon you better get supper on he says,dewey dell does not move,faulkner
24507,24508,git up now and put supper on pa says,we got to keep our strength up,faulkner
24509,24510,i reckon doctor peabody s right hungry coming all this way,and need to eat quick and get back to work so he can finish it in time,faulkner
24511,24512,dewey dell rises heaving to her feet,she looks down at the face,faulkner
24513,24514,it is like a casting of fading bronze upon the pillow the hands alone still with any semblance of life a curled gnarled ineptness a spent yet alert quality from which weariness exhaustion travail has not yet departed as though they doubted even yet the actuality of rest guarding with horned and penurious alertness the cessation which they know can not last,dewey dell stoops and slides the quilt from beneath them and draws it up over them to the chin smoothing it down drawing it smooth,faulkner
24515,24516,then without looking at pa she goes around the bed and leaves the room,she will go out where peabody is where she can stand in the twilight and look at his back with such an expression that feeling her eyes and turning he will say i would not let it grieve me now,faulkner
24517,24518,she was old and sick too,suffering more than we knew,faulkner
24519,24520,she could nt have got well,vardaman s getting big now and with you to take good care of them all,faulkner
24521,24522,i would try not to let it grieve me,i expect you d better go and get some supper ready,faulkner
24523,24524,it dont have to be much,but they ll need to eat and she looking at him saying you could do so much for me if you just would,faulkner
24525,24526,if you just knew,he raises his hand to his head scouring his hair listening to the saw,faulkner
24527,24528,he comes nearer and rubs his hand palm and back on his thigh and lays it on her face and then on the hump of quilt where her hands are,he touches the quilt as he saw dewey dell do trying to smoothe it up to the chin but disarranging it instead,faulkner
24529,24530,he tries to smoothe it again clumsily his hand awkward as a claw smoothing at the wrinkles which he made and which continue to emerge beneath his hand with perverse ubiquity so that at last he desists his hand falling to his side and stroking itself again palm and back on his thigh,the sound of the saw snores steadily into the room,faulkner
24531,24532,pa breathes with a quiet rasping sound mouthing the snuff against his gums,god s will be done he says,faulkner
24533,24534,now i can get them teeth,jewel s hat droops limp about his neck channelling water onto the soaked towsack tied about his shoulders as ankledeep in the running ditch he pries with a slipping twobyfour with a piece of rotting log for fulcrum at the axle,faulkner
24535,24536,jewel i say she is dead jewel,i run toward the back and come to the edge of the porch and stop,faulkner
24537,24538,then i begin to cry,i can feel where the fish was in the dust,faulkner
24539,24540,it is cut up into pieces of notfish now notblood on my hands and overalls,then it was nt so,faulkner
24541,24542,it had nt happened then,and now she is getting so far ahead i can not catch her,faulkner
24543,24544,the trees look like chickens when they ruffle out into the cool dust on the hot days,if i jump off the porch i will be where the fish was and it all cut up into notfish now,faulkner
24545,24546,i can hear the bed and her face and them and i can feel the floor shake when he walks on it that came and did it,that came and did it when she was all right but he came and did it,faulkner
24547,24548,the fat son of a bitch,i jump from the porch running,faulkner
24549,24550,the top of the barn comes swooping up out of the twilight,if i jump i can go through it like the pink lady in the circus into the warm smelling without having to wait my hands grab at the bushes beneath my feet the rocks and dirt go rubbling down,faulkner
24551,24552,then i can breathe again in the warm smelling,i enter the stall trying to touch him and then i can cry then i vomit the crying,faulkner
24553,24554,as soon as he gets through kicking i can and then i can cry the crying can,he kilt her,faulkner
24555,24556,he kilt her,the me in him runs under the skin under my hand running through the splotches smelling up into my nose where the sickness is beginning to cry vomiting the crying and then i can breathe vomiting it,faulkner
24557,24558,it makes a lot of noise,i can smell the life running up from under my hands up my arms and then i cart leave the stall,faulkner
24559,24560,i can not find it,in the dark along the dust the walls i can not find it,faulkner
24561,24562,the crying makes a lot of noise,i wish it would nt make so much noise,faulkner
24563,24564,then i find it in the wagon shed in the dust and i run across the lot and into the road the stick jouncing on my shoulder,they watch me as i run up beginning to jerk back their eyes rolling snorting jerking back on the hitchrein,faulkner
24565,24566,i strike,i can hear the stick striking i can see it hitting their heads the breastyoke missing altogether sometimes as they rear and plunge but i am glad,faulkner
24567,24568,but it is still long enough,i run this way and that as they rear and jerk at the hitchrein striking,faulkner
24569,24570,you kilt her,i strike at them striking they wheeling in a long lunge the buggy wheeling onto two wheels and motionless like it is nailed to the ground and the horses motionless like they are nailed by the hind feet to the center of a whirling plate,faulkner
24571,24572,i run in the dust i can not see running in the sucking dust where the buggy vanishes tilted on two wheels,i strike the stick hitting into the ground bouncing striking into the dust and then into the air again and the dust sucking on down the road faster than if a car was in it,faulkner
24573,24574,and then i can cry looking at the stick,it is broken down to my hand not longer than stove wood that was a long stick,faulkner
24575,24576,i throw it away and i can cry,it does not make so much noise now,faulkner
24577,24578,the cow is standing in the barn door chewing,when she sees me come into the lot she lows her mouth full of flopping green her tongue flopping,faulkner
24579,24580,i aint agoin to milk you,i aint agoin to do nothing for them,faulkner
24581,24582,i hear her turn when i pass,when i turn she is just behind me with her sweet hot hard breath,faulkner
24583,24584,did nt i tell you i would nt,she nudges me snuffing,faulkner
24585,24586,she moans deep inside her mouth closed,i jerk my hand cursing her like jewel does,faulkner
24587,24588,git now,i stoop my hand to the ground and run at her,faulkner
24589,24590,she jumps back and whirls away and stops watching me,she moans,faulkner
24591,24592,she goes on,to the path and stands there looking up the path,faulkner
24593,24594,it is dark in the barn warm smelling silent,i can cry quietly watching the top of the hill,faulkner
24595,24596,cash comes to the hill limping where he fell off of the church,he looks down at the spring then up the road and back toward the barn,faulkner
24597,24598,he comes down the path stiffly and looks at the broken hitchrein and at the dust in the road and then up the road where the dust is gone,i hope they ve got clean past tull s by now,faulkner
24599,24600,i so hope hit,cash turns and limps up the path,faulkner
24601,24602,durn him,i showed him,faulkner
24603,24604,durn him,i am not crying now,faulkner
24605,24606,i am not anything,dewey dell comes to the hill and calls me,faulkner
24607,24608,vardaman,i am not anything,faulkner
24609,24610,i am quiet,you vardaman,faulkner
24611,24612,i can cry quiet now feeling and hearing my tears,then hit want,faulkner
24613,24614,hit had nt happened then,hit was alayin right there on the ground,faulkner
24615,24616,and now she s gittin ready to cook hit,it is dark,faulkner
24617,24618,i can hear wood silence i know them,but not living sounds not even him,faulkner
24619,24620,it is as though the dark were resolving him out of his integrity into an unrelated scattering of components snuffings and stampings smells of cooling flesh and ammoniac hair an illusion of a coordinated whole of splotched hide and strong bones within which detached and secret and familiar an is different from my is,i see him dissolve legs a rolling eye a gaudy splotching like cold flames and float upon the dark in fading solution all one yet neither all either yet none,faulkner
24621,24622,i can see hearing coil toward him caressing shaping his hard shape fetlock hip shoulder and head smell and sound,i am not afraid,faulkner
24623,24624,cooked and et,he could do everything for me,faulkner
24625,24626,it s like everything in the world for me is inside a tub full of guts so that you wonder how there can be any room in it for anything else very important,he is a big tub of guts and i am a little tub of guts and if there is not any room for anything else important in a big tub of guts how can it be room in a little tub of guts,faulkner
24627,24628,but i know it is there because god gave women a sign when something has happened bad,it s because i am alone,faulkner
24629,24630,if i could just feel it it would be different because i would not be alone,but if i were not alone everybody would know it,faulkner
24631,24632,and he could do so much for me and then i would not be alone,then i could be all right alone,faulkner
24633,24634,i would let him come in between me and lafe like darl came in between me and lafe and so lafe is alone too,he is lafe and i am dewey dell and when mother died i had to go beyond and outside of me and lafe and darl to grieve because he could do so much for me and he dont know it,faulkner
24635,24636,he dont even know it,from the back porch i can not see the barn,faulkner
24637,24638,then the sound of cash s sawing comes in from that way,it is like a dog outside the house going back and forth around the house to whatever door you come to waiting to come in,faulkner
24639,24640,he said i worry more than you do and i said you dont know what worry is so i cant worry,i try to but i cant think long enough to worry,faulkner
24641,24642,i light the kitchen lamp,the fish cut into jagged pieces bleeds quietly in the pan,faulkner
24643,24644,i put it into the cupboard quick listening into the hall hearing,it took her ten days to die maybe she dont know it is yet,faulkner
24645,24646,maybe she wont go until cash,or maybe until jewel,faulkner
24647,24648,i take the dish of greens from the cupboard and the bread pan from the cold stove and i stop watching the door,where s vardaman,faulkner
24649,24650,cash says,in the lamp his sawdusted arms look like sand,faulkner
24651,24652,i dont know,i aint seen him,faulkner
24653,24654,peabody s team run away,see if you can find vardaman,faulkner
24655,24656,the horse will let him catch him,well,faulkner
24657,24658,tell them to come to supper,i can not see the barn,faulkner
24659,24660,i said i dont know how to worry,i dont know how to cry,faulkner
24661,24662,i tried but i cant,after a while the sound of the saw comes around coming dark along the ground in the dustdark,faulkner
24663,24664,then i can see him going up and down above the plank,you come in to supper i say,faulkner
24665,24666,tell him,he could do everything for me,faulkner
24667,24668,and he dont know it,he is his guts and i am my guts,faulkner
24669,24670,and i am lafe s guts,that s it,faulkner
24671,24672,i dont see why he did nt stay in town,we are country people not as good as town people,faulkner
24673,24674,i dont see why he did nt,then i can see the top of the barn,faulkner
24675,24676,the cow stands at the foot of the path lowing,when i turn back cash is gone,faulkner
24677,24678,i carry the buttermilk in,pa and cash and he are at the table,faulkner

24683,24684,plain turnip greens is mighty spindling eating for a man my size he says,cash is eating,faulkner
24685,24686,about his head the print of his hat is sweated into his hair,his shirt is blotched with sweat,faulkner
24687,24688,he has not washed his hands and arms,you ought to took time pa says,faulkner
24689,24690,where s vardaman,i go toward the door,faulkner

24693,24694,it ll save i reckon,come on and sit down,faulkner
24695,24696,i aint minding it i say,i m going to milk before it sets in to rain,faulkner
24697,24698,pa helps himself and pushes the dish on,but he does not begin to eat,faulkner
24699,24700,his hands are halfclosed on either side of his plate his head bowed a little his awry hair standing into the lamplight,he looks like right after the maul hits the steer and it no longer alive and dont yet know that it is dead,faulkner
24701,24702,but cash is eating and he is too,you better eat something he says,faulkner
24703,24704,he is looking at pa,like cash and me,faulkner
24705,24706,you ll need it,ay pa says,faulkner
24707,24708,the cow lows at the foot of the bluff,she nuzzles at me snuffing blowing her breath in a sweet hot blast through my dress against my hot nakedness moaning,faulkner
24709,24710,you got to wait a little while,then i ll tend to you,faulkner
24711,24712,she follows me into the barn where i set the bucket down,she breathes into the bucket moaning,faulkner
24713,24714,i told you,you just got to wait now,faulkner
24715,24716,i got more to do than i can tend to,the barn is dark,faulkner
24717,24718,when i pass he kicks the wall a single blow,i go on,faulkner
24719,24720,the broken plank is like a pale plank standing on end,then i can see the slope feel the air moving on my face again slow pale with lesser dark and with empty seeing the pine clumps blotched up the tilted slope secret and waiting,faulkner
24721,24722,the cow in silhouette against the door nuzzles at the silhouette of the bucket moaning,then i pass the stall,faulkner
24723,24724,i have almost passed it i listen to it saying for a long time before it can say the word and the listening part is afraid that there may not be time to say it i feel my body my bones and flesh beginning to part and open upon the alone and the process of coming unalone is terrible,lafe,faulkner
24725,24726,lafe,lafe lafe,faulkner
24727,24728,lafe,i lean a little forward one foot advanced with dead walking,faulkner
24729,24730,i feel the darkness rushing past my breast past the cow i begin to rush upon the darkness but the cow stops me and the darkness rushes on upon the sweet blast of her moaning breath filled with wood and with silence,vardaman,faulkner

24783,24784,go on now before that old greeneating tub of guts eats everything up from you,he goes on disappearing slowly into the hill,faulkner
24785,24786,the crest the trees the roof of the house stand against the sky,the cow nuzzles at me moaning,faulkner
24787,24788,youll just have to wait,what you got in you aint nothing to what i got in me even if you are a woman too,faulkner
24789,24790,she follows me moaning,then the dead hot pale air breathes on my face again,faulkner
24791,24792,he could fix it all right if he just would,and he dont even know it,faulkner
24793,24794,he could do everything for me if he just knowed it,the cow breathes upon my hips and back her breath warm sweet stertorous moaning,faulkner
24795,24796,the sky lies flat down the slope upon the secret dumps,beyond the hill sheetlightning stains upward and fades,faulkner
24797,24798,the dead air shapes the dead earth in the dead darkness further away than seeing shapes the dead earth,it lies dead and warm upon me touching me naked through my clothes,faulkner
24799,24800,i said you dont know what worry is,i dont know what it is,faulkner
24801,24802,i dont know whether i am worrying or not,whether i can or not,faulkner
24803,24804,i dont know whether i can cry or not,i dont know whether i have tried to or not,faulkner
24805,24806,i feel like a wet seed wild in the hot blind earth,i saw the dark stand up and go whirling away and i said are you going to nail her up in it cash,faulkner
24807,24808,cash,cash got shut up in the crib the new door it was too heavy for me it went shut i could nt breathe because the rat was breathing up all the air,faulkner
24809,24810,i said are you going to nail it shut cash,nail it,faulkner
24811,24812,nail it,pa walks around,faulkner
24813,24814,his shadow walks around over cash going up and down above the saw at the bleeding plank,dewey dell said we will get some bananas,faulkner
24815,24816,the train is behind the glass red on the track,when it runs the track shines on and off,faulkner
24817,24818,pa said flour and sugar and coffee costs so much,because i am a country boy because boys in town,faulkner
24819,24820,bicycles,why do flour and sugar and coffee cost so much when he is a country boy,faulkner
24821,24822,would nt you ruther have some bananasinstead,bananas are gone eaten,faulkner
24823,24824,gone,when it runs on the track shines again,faulkner
24825,24826,why aint i a town boy pa,i said,faulkner
24827,24828,god made me,i did not said to god to made me in the country,faulkner
24829,24830,if he can make the train why cant he make them all in the town because flour and sugar and coffee,would nt you ruther have bananas,faulkner
24831,24832,he walks around,his shadow walks around,faulkner
24833,24834,it was not her,i was there looking,faulkner
24835,24836,i saw,i thought it was her but it was not,faulkner
24837,24838,it was not my mother,she went away when the other one laid down in her bed and drew the quilt up,faulkner
24839,24840,she went away,did she go as far as town,faulkner
24841,24842,she went further than town,did all those rabbits and possums go further than town,faulkner
24843,24844,god made the rabbits and possums,he made the train,faulkner
24845,24846,why must he make a different place for them to go if she is just like the rabbit,pa walks around,faulkner
24847,24848,his shadow does,the saw sounds like it is asleep,faulkner
24849,24850,and so if cash nails the box up she is not a rabbit,and so if she is not a rabbit i could nt breathe in the crib and cash is going to nail it up,faulkner
24851,24852,and so if she lets him it is not her,i know,faulkner
24853,24854,i was there,i saw when it did not be her,faulkner
24855,24856,i saw,they think it is and cash is going to nail it up,faulkner
24857,24858,it was not her because it was laying right yonder in the dirt and now it s all chopped up,i chopped it up,faulkner
24859,24860,it s laying in the kitchen in the bleeding pan waiting to be cooked and et,then it was nt and she was and now it is and she was nt,faulkner
24861,24862,and tomorrow it will be cooked and et and she will be him and pa and cash and dewey dell and there wont be anything in the box and so she can breathe,it was laying right yonder on the ground,faulkner
24863,24864,i can get vernon,he was there and he seen it and with both of us it will be and then it will not be,faulkner
24865,24866,it had been a misdoubtful night with the storm making a night when a fellow looks for most anything to happen before he can get the stock fed and himself to the house and supper et and in bed with the rain starting and when peabody s team come up lathered with the broke harness dragging and the neckyoke betwixt the off critter s legs cora says it s addie bundren,she s gone at last,faulkner
24867,24868,peabody mought have been to ere a one of a dozen houses hereabouts i says,besides how do you know it s peabody s team,faulkner
24869,24870,well aint it,she says,faulkner
24871,24872,you hitch up now,what for,faulkner
24873,24874,i says,if she is gone we cant do nothing till morning,faulkner
24875,24876,and it fixing to storm too,it s my duty she says,faulkner
24877,24878,you put the team in,but i would nt do it,faulkner
24879,24880,it stands to reason they d send for us if they needed us,you dont even know she s gone yet,faulkner
24881,24882,why dont you know that s peabody s team,do you claim it aint,faulkner
24883,24884,well then,but i would nt go,faulkner
24885,24886,when folks wants a fellow it s best to wait till they sends for him i ve found,it s my christian duty cora says,faulkner
24887,24888,will you stand between me and my christian duty,you can stay there allday tomorrow if you want i says,faulkner
24889,24890,so when cora waked me it had set in to rain,even while i was going to the door with the lamp and it shining on the glass so he could see i am coming it kept on knocking,faulkner
24891,24892,not loud but steady like he might have gone to sleep thumping but i never noticed how low down on the door the knocking was till i opened it and never seen nothing,i held the lamp up with the rain sparkling across it and cora back in the hall saying who is it vernon,faulkner
24893,24894,but i could nt see nobody atall at first until i looked down and around the door lowering the lamp,he looked like a drownded puppy in them overalls without no hat splashed up to his knees where he had walked them four miles in the mud,faulkner
24895,24896,who is it vernon,cora says,faulkner
24897,24898,he looked at me his eyes round and black in the middle like when you throw a light in a owl s face,you mind that ere fish he says,faulkner
24899,24900,come in the house i says,what is it,faulkner
24901,24902,he stood kind of around behind the door in the dark,the rain was blowing onto the lamp hissing on it so i am scared every minute it ll break,faulkner
24903,24904,you was there he says,you seen it,faulkner
24905,24906,then cora come to the door,you come right in outen the rain she says pulling him in and him watching me,faulkner
24907,24908,he looked just like a drownded puppy,i told you cora says,faulkner
24909,24910,i told you it was ahappening,you go and hitch,faulkner
24911,24912,but he aint said i says,he looked at me dripping onto the floor,faulkner
24913,24914,he s aruining the rug cora says,you go get the team while i take him to the kitchen,faulkner
24915,24916,but he hung back dripping watching me with them eyes,you was there,faulkner
24917,24918,you seen it laying there,cash is fixing to nail her up and it was alaying right there on the ground,faulkner
24919,24920,you seen it,you seen the mark in the dirt,faulkner
24921,24922,the rain never come up till after i was acoming here,so we can get back in time,faulkner
24923,24924,i be durn if it did nt give me the creeps even when i did nt know yet,but cora did,faulkner
24925,24926,you get that team quick as you can she says,he s outen his head with grief and worry,faulkner
24927,24928,i be durn if it did nt give me the creeps,now and then a fellow gets to thinking,faulkner
24929,24930,about all the sorrow and afflictions in this world how it s liable to strike anywhere like lightning,i reckon it does take a powerful trust in the lord to guard a fellow though sometimes i think that cora s a mite overcautious like she was trying to crowd the other folks away and get in closer than anybody else,faulkner
24931,24932,now and then a fellow gets to thinking about it not often though,which is a good thing,faulkner
24933,24934,for the lord aimed for him to do and not to spend too much time thinking because his brain it s like a piece of machinery it wont stand a whole lot of racking,it s best when it all runs along the same doing the day s work and not no one part used no more than needful,faulkner
24935,24936,i have said and i say again that s ever living thing the matter with darl he just thinks by himself too much,cora s right when she says all he needs is a wife to straighten him out,faulkner
24937,24938,and when i think about that i think that if nothing but being married will help a man he s durn nigh hopeless,she was dressed on top of her nightgownd with a shawl over her head and her umbrella and her bible wrapped up in the oilcloth and him sitting on a upturned bucket on the stovezinc where she had put him dripping onto the floor,faulkner
24939,24940,cant get nothing outen him except about a fish she says,it s a judgment on them,faulkner
24941,24942,i see the hand of the lord upon this boy for anse bundrens judgment and warning,the rain never come up till after i left he says,faulkner
24943,24944,i had done left,i was on the way,faulkner
24945,24946,and so it was there in the dust you seen it cash is fixing to nail her but you seen it,when we got there it was raining hard and him sitting on the seat between us wrapped up in cora s shawl,faulkner
24947,24948,he had nt said nothing else just sitting there with cora holding the umbrella over him,now and then cora would stop singing long enough to say it s a judgment on anse bundren,faulkner
24949,24950,may it show him the path of sin he is atrodding,then she would sing again and him sitting there between us leaning forward a little like the mules could nt go fast enough to suit him,faulkner
24951,24952,it was laying right yonder he says but the rain come up after i taken and left,twice he did it and him so dead for sleep that cora says his face looked like one of these here christmas masts that had done been buried a while and then dug up until at last they put her into it and nailed it down so he could nt open the window on her no more,faulkner
24953,24954,and the next morning they found him in his shirt tail laying asleep on the floor like a felled steer and the top of the box bored clean full of holes and cash s new auger broke off in the last one,when they taken the lid off they found that two of them had bored on into her face,faulkner
24955,24956,if it s a judgment it aint right,because the lord s got more to do than that,faulkner
24957,24958,he s bound to have,because die only burden anse bundren s ever had is himself,faulkner
24959,24960,and when folks talks him low i think to myself he aint that less of a man or he could nt a bore himself this long,it aint right,faulkner
24961,24962,i be durn if it is,because he said suffer little children to come unto me dont make it right neither,faulkner
24963,24964,cora said have bore you what the lord god sent me,i faced it without fear nor terror because my faith was strong in the lord abolstering and sustaining me,faulkner
24965,24966,if you have no son it s because the lord has decreed otherwise in his wisdom,and my life is and has ever been a open book to ere a man or woman among his creatures because i trust in my god and my reward,faulkner
24967,24968,i reckon she s right,i reckon if there s ere a man or woman anywhere that he could turn it all over to and go away with his mind at rest it would be cora,faulkner
24969,24970,and i reckon she would make a few changes no matter how he was running it and i reckon they would be for man s good,leastways we would have to like them,faulkner
24971,24972,leastways we might as well go on and make like we did,rusted greasefouled its cracked chimney smeared on one side with a soaring smudge of soot it sheds a feeble and sultry glare upon the trestles and the boards and the adjacent earth,faulkner
24973,24974,upon the dark ground the chips look like random smears of soft pale paint on a black canvas,the boards look like long smooth tatters torn from the flat darkness and turned backside out,faulkner
24975,24976,cash labors about the trestles moving back and forth lifting and placing the planks with long clattering reverberations in the dead air as though he were lifting and dropping them at the bottom of an invisible well the sounds ceasing without departing as if any movement might dislodge them from the immediate air in reverberant repetition,he saws again his elbow flashing slowly a thin thread of fire running along the edge of the saw lost and recovered at the top and bottom of each stroke in unbroken elongation so that the saw appears to be six feet long into and out of pa s shabby and aimless silhouette,faulkner
24977,24978,give me that plank cash says,no the other one,faulkner
24979,24980,he puts the saw down and comes and picks up the plank he wants sweeping pa away with the long swinging gleam of the balanced board,the air smells like sulphur,faulkner
24981,24982,upon the impalpable plane of it their shadows form as upon a wall as though like sound they had not gone very far away in falling but had merely congealed for a moment immediate and musing,cash works on half turned into the feeble light one thigh and one polethin arm braced his face sloped into the light with a rapt dynamic immobility above his tireless elbow,faulkner
24983,24984,below the sky sheetlightning slumbers lightly against it the trees motionless are ruffled out to the last twig swollen increased as though quick with young,it begins to rain,faulkner
24985,24986,the first harsh sparse swift drops rush through the leaves and across the ground in a long sigh as though of relief from intolerable suspense,they are big as buckshot warm as though fired from a gun they sweep across the lantern in a vicious hissing,faulkner
24987,24988,pa lifts his face slackmouthed the wet black rim of snuff plastered close along the base of his gums from behind his slackfaced astonishment he muses as though from beyond time upon the ultimate outrage,cash looks once at the sky then at the lantern,faulkner
24989,24990,the saw has not faltered the running gleam of its pistoning edge unbroken,get something to cover the lantern he says,faulkner
24991,24992,pa goes to the house,the rain rushes suddenly down without thunder without warning of any sort he is swept onto the porch upon the edge of it and in an instant cash is wet to the skin,faulkner
24993,24994,yet the motion of the saw has not faltered as though it and the arm functioned in a tranquil conviction that rain was an illusion of the mind,he is wearing jewel s raincoat and carrying dewey dell s,faulkner
24995,24996,squatting over the lantern cash reaches back and picks up four sticks and drives them into the earth and takes dewey dell s raincoat from pa and spreads it over the sticks forming a roof above the lantern,pa watches him,faulkner
24997,24998,i dont know what you ll do he says,darl taken his coat with him,faulkner
24999,25000,get wet cash says,he takes up the saw again again it moves up and down in and out of that unhurried imperviousness as a piston moves in the oil soaked scrawny tireless with the lean light body a boy or an old man,faulkner
25001,25002,pa watches him blinking his,face streaming again he looks up at the sky with that expression of dumb and brooding outrage and yet of vindication as though he had expected no less now and then he stirs moves gaunt and streaming picking up a board or a tool and then laying it down,faulkner
25003,25004,vernon tull is there now and cash is wearing mrs tuil s raincoat and he and vernon are hunting the saw,after a while they find it in pa s hand,faulkner
25005,25006,why dont you go on to the house out of the rain,cash says,faulkner
25007,25008,pa looks at him his face streaming slowly,it is as though upon a face carved by a savage caricaturist a monstrous burlesque of all bereavement flowed,faulkner
25009,25010,you go on in cash says,me and vernon can finish it pa looks at item,faulkner
25011,25012,the sleeves of jewel s coat are too short for him,upon his face the rain streams slow as cold glycerin,faulkner
25013,25014,i dont begrudge her the wetting he says,he moves again and falls to shifting the planks picking them up laying them down again carefully as though they are glass,faulkner
25015,25016,he goes to the lantern and pulls at the propped raincoat until he knocks it down and cash conies and fixes it back,you get on to the house cash says,faulkner
25017,25018,he leads pa to the house and returns with the raincoat and folds it and places it beneath the shelter where the lantern sits,vernon has not stopped,faulkner
25019,25020,he looks up still sawing,you ought to done that at first he says,faulkner
25021,25022,you knowed it was fixing to rain,it s his fever cash says,faulkner
25023,25024,he looks at the board,ay vernon says,faulkner
25025,25026,he d a come anyway,cash squints at the board,faulkner
25027,25028,on the long flank of it the rain crashes steadily myriad fluctuant,i m going to bevel it he says,faulkner
25029,25030,it ll take more time vernon says,cash sets the plank on edge a moment longer vernon watches him then he hands him the plane,faulkner
25031,25032,vernon holds the board steady while cash bevels edge of it with the tedious and minute care of a jeweler,mrs tull comes to the edge of the porch and calls vernon,faulkner
25033,25034,how near are you done,she says,faulkner
25035,25036,vernon does not look up,not long,faulkner
25037,25038,some yet she watches cash stooping at the plank the turgid savage gleam of the lantern slicking on the raincoat as he moves,you go down and get some planks off the barn and finish it and come in out of the ram she says,faulkner
25039,25040,you ll both catch your death,vernon does not move,faulkner
25041,25042,vernon she says,we wont be long he says,faulkner
25043,25044,well be done after a spell,mrs tull watches them a while,faulkner
25045,25046,then she reenters the house,if we get in a tight we could take some of them planks vernon says,faulkner
25047,25048,i ll help you put them back,cash ceases the plane and squints along the plank wiping it with his palm,faulkner
25049,25050,give me the next one he says,some time toward dawn the rain ceases,faulkner
25051,25052,but it is not yet day when cash drives the last nail and stands stiffly up and looks down at the finished coffin the others watching him,in the lantern light his face is calm musing slowly he strokes his hands on his raincoated thighs in a gesture deliberate final and composed,faulkner
25053,25054,then the four of them cash and pa and vernon and peabody raise the coffin to their shoulders and turn toward the house,it is light yet they move slowly empty yet they carry it carefully lifeless yet they move with hushed precautionary words to one another speaking of it as though complete it now slumbered lightly alive waiting to come awake,faulkner
25055,25056,on the dark floor their feet clump awkwardly as though for a long time they have not walked on floors,they set it down by the bed,faulkner
25057,25058,peabody says quietly let s eat a snack it s almost daylight where s cash,he has returned to the trestles stooped again in the lantern s feeble glare as he gathers up his tools and wipes them on a cloth carefully and puts them into the box with its leather sling to go over the shoulder,faulkner
25059,25060,then he takes up box lantern and raincoat and returns to the house mounting the steps into faint silhouette against the paling east,in a strange room you must empty yourself for sleep,faulkner
25061,25062,and before you are emptied for sleep what are you,and when you are emptied for sleep you are not,faulkner
25063,25064,and when you are filled with sleep you never were,i dont know what i am,faulkner
25065,25066,i dont know if i am or not,jewel knows he is because he does not know that he does not know whether he is or not,faulkner
25067,25068,he can not empty himself for sleep because he is not what he is and he is what he is not,beyond the unlamped wall i can hear the rain shaping the wagon that is ours the load that is no longer theirs that felled and sawed it nor yet theirs that bought it and which is not ours either lie on our wagon though it does since only the wind and the rain shape it only to jewel and me that are not asleep,faulkner
25069,25070,and since sleep is isnot and rain and wind are was it is not,yet the wagon is because when the wagon is was addie bundren will not be,faulkner
25071,25072,and jewel is so addie bundren must be,and then i must be or i could not empty myself for sleep in a strange room,faulkner
25073,25074,and so if i am not emptied yet i am is,there is more surface for the nails to grip,faulkner
25075,25076,there is twice the grippingsurface to each seam,the water will have to seep into it on a slant,faulkner
25077,25078,water moves easiest up and down or straight across,in a house people are upright two thirds of the time,faulkner
25079,25080,so the seams and joints are made upanddown,because the stress is upanddown,faulkner
25081,25082,in a bed where people lie down all the time the joints and seams are made sideways because the stress is sideways,except,faulkner
25083,25084,a body is not square like a crosstie,animal magnetism,faulkner
25085,25086,the animal magnetism of a dead body makes the stress come slanting so the seams and joints of a coffin are made on the bevel,you can see by an old grave that the earth sinks down on the bevel,faulkner
25087,25088,while in a natural hole it sinks by the center the stress being upanddown,so i made it on the bevel,faulkner
25089,25090,it makes a neater job,it was pulled out of the road at the spring and about a dozen wagons was already there,faulkner
25091,25092,it was quick found it,he said the rive was up and still rising,faulkner
25093,25094,he said it had already covered the highest watermark on the bridgepiling he ever seen,that bridge wont stand a whole lot water i said,faulkner
25095,25096,has somebody told anse about it,i told him quick said,faulkner
25097,25098,he says he reckons the boys has heard and unloaded and are on the way by now,he says they can load up and get across,faulkner
25099,25100,he better go on and bury her at new hope armstid said,that bridge is old,faulkner
25101,25102,then he better get at it soon as he can armstid said,anse meets us at the door,faulkner

25223,25224,his voice in bigger than him,it s like they are not the same,faulkner

25227,25228,it sounds like her eyes and her voice were turned back inside her listening we move shifting to the other leg meeting one another s eye and making like they had nt touched,whitfield stops at last,faulkner
25229,25230,the women sing again,in the thick air it s like their voices come out of the air flowing together and on in the sad comforting tunes when they cease it s like they had nt gone away,faulkner
25231,25232,it s like they had just disappeared into the air and when we moved we would loose them again out of the air around us sad and comfort y then they finish and we put on our hats our movements stiff like we had nt never wore hats before,i am bounding toward my god and my reward she sings sitting on the wagon the shawl around her shoulder and the umbrella open over her though it is not raining,faulkner

25255,25256,dewey dell seen it,i m bounding toward my god and my reward cora sung,faulkner
25257,25258,he sits erect on the seat leaning a little forward woodenbacked,the brim of his hat has soaked free of the crown in two places drooping across his wooden face so that head lowered he looks through it like through the visor of a helmet looking long across the valley to where the barn leans against the bluff shaping the invisible horse,faulkner
25259,25260,see them,i say,faulkner
25261,25262,high above the house against the quick thick sky they hang in narrowing circles,from here they are no more than specks implacable patient portentous,faulkner
25263,25264,but it s not your horse that s dead,goddamn you he says,faulkner
25265,25266,goddamn you,i can not love my mother because i have no mother,faulkner
25267,25268,jewel s mother is a horse,motionless the tall buzzards hang in soaring circles the clouds giving them an illusion of retrograde,faulkner
25269,25270,motionless woodenbacked woodenfaced he shapes the horse in a rigid stoop like a hawk hookwinged,they are waiting for us ready for the moving of it waiting for him,faulkner
25271,25272,he enters the stall and waits until it kicks at him so that he can slip past and mount onto the trough and pause peering out across the intervening stalltops toward the empty path before he reaches into the loft,goddamn him,faulkner
25273,25274,goddamn him,goddamn you pick up,faulkner
25275,25276,in his face the blood goes in waves,in between them his flesh is greenish looking about that smooth thick pale green of cow s cud his face suffocated furious his lip lifted upon his teeth,faulkner
25277,25278,pick up,he says,faulkner
25279,25280,pick up goddamn your thicknosed soul,he heaves lifting one whole side so suddenly that we all spring into the lift to catch and balance it before he hurls it completely over,faulkner
25281,25282,for an instant it resists as though volitional as though within it her polethin body clings furiously even though dead to a sort of modesty as she would have tried to conceal a soiled garment that she could not prevent her body soiling,then it breaks free rising suddenly as though the emaciation of her body had added buoyancy to the planks or as though seeing that the garment was about to be torn from her she rushes suddenly after it in a passionate reversal that flouts its own desire and need,faulkner
25283,25284,jewel s face goes completely green and i can hear teeth in his breath,we carry it down the hall our feet harsh and clumsy on the floor moving with shuffling steps and through the door,faulkner
25285,25286,steady it a minute now pa says letting go,he turns back to shut and lock the door but jewel will not wait,faulkner
25287,25288,come on he says in that suffocating voice,come on,faulkner
25289,25290,we lower it carefully down the steps,we move balancing it as though it were something infinitely precious our faces averted breathing through our teeth to keep our nostrils closed,faulkner
25291,25292,we go down the path toward die slope,we better wait cash says,faulkner
25293,25294,i tell you it aint balanced now,well need another hand on that hill,faulkner
25295,25296,then turn loose jewel says,he will not stop,faulkner
25297,25298,cash begins to fall behind hobbling to keep up breathing harshly then he is distanced and jewel carries the entire front end alone so that tilting as the path begins to slant it begins to rush away from me and slip down the air like a sled upon invisible snow smoothly evacuating atmosphere in which the sense of it is still shaped,wait jewel i say,faulkner
25299,25300,but he will not wait,he is almost running now and cash is left behind,faulkner
25301,25302,it seems to me that the end which i now carry alone has no weight as though it coasts like a rushing straw upon the furious tide of jewel s despair,i am not even touching it when turning he lets it overshoot him swinging and stops it and sloughs it into the wagon bed in the same motion and looks back at me his face suffused with fury and despair,faulkner
25303,25304,goddamn you,goddamn you,faulkner
25305,25306,dewey dell says it wont be sold because it belongs to santa claus and he taken it back with him until next christmas,then it will be behind the glass again shining with waiting,faulkner

25373,25374,dewey dell carries the basket on one arm in the other hand something wrapped square in a newspaper,her face is calm and sullen her eyes brooding and alert within them i can see peabody s back like two round peas in two thimbles perhaps in peabody s back two of those worms which work surreptitious and steady through you and out the other side and you waking suddenly from sleep or from waking with on your face an expression sudden intent and concerned,faulkner
25375,25376,she sets the basket into the wagon and climbs in her leg coming long from beneath her tightening dress that lever which moves the world one of that caliper which measures the length and breadth life,she sits on the seat beside vardaman and sets the parcel on her lap,faulkner
25377,25378,then he enters lie barn,he has not looked back,faulkner
25379,25380,it aint rights pa says,ifs little enough for him to do for her,faulkner
25381,25382,go on cash,says,faulkner

25385,25386,maybe hell go up to lull s and stay,hell catch us i say,faulkner
25387,25388,hell cut across and meet us at tull s lane,he would have rid that horse too pa says i had nt a stopped him,faulkner
25389,25390,a durn spotted critter wilder than a cattymount,behind us above the house motionless in tall and soaring circles they diminish and disappear,faulkner
25391,25392,setting back there on the plank seat with cash with his dead ma laying in her coffin at his feet laughing,how many times i told him if s doing such things as that that makes folks talk about him i dont know,faulkner
25393,25394,i says i got some regard for what folks says about my flesh and blood even if you have nt even if i have raised such a durn passel of boys and when you fixes it so folks can say such about you it s a reflection on your ma i says not me i am a man and i can stand it it s on your womenfolks your ma and sister that you should care for and i turned and looked back at him and him setting there laughing,i dont expect you to have no respect for me i says,faulkner
25395,25396,but with your own ma not cold in her coffin yet,yonder cash says jerking his head toward the lane,faulkner
25397,25398,the horse is still a right smart piece away coming up at a good pace but i dont have to be told who it is,i just looked back at darl setting there laughing,faulkner
25399,25400,i done my best i says,i tried to do as she would wish it,faulkner
25401,25402,the lord will pardon me and excuse the conduct of them he sent me,and darl setting on the plank seat right above her where she was laying laughing,faulkner
25403,25404,then he slows a little light and erect in the saddle the horse mincing through the mud,tull is in his lot he looks at us lifts his hand,faulkner
25405,25406,we go on the wagon creaking the mud whispering on the wheels,vernon still stands there,faulkner
25407,25408,he watches jewel as he passes the horse moving with a light highkneed driving gait three hundred yards back,we go on with a motion so soporific so dreamlike as to be uninferant of progress as though time and not space were decreasing between us and it,faulkner
25409,25410,it turns off at right angles the wheelmarts of last sunday healed away now a smooth red scoriation curving away into the pines a white signboard with faded lettering new hope church,mi,faulkner
25411,25412,it wheels up like a motionless hand lifted above the profound desolation of the ocean beyond it the red road lies like a spoke of which addie,bundren,faulkner
25413,25414,is the rim,it wheels past empty unscarred the white signboard turns awayits fading and tranquil assertion,faulkner
25415,25416,cash looks lip the road quietly his bead turning as we pass it like an owls head his face composed,pa looks straight ahead humped,faulkner
25417,25418,dewey dell looks at the road too then she looks back at me her eyes watchful and repudiant not like that question which was in those of cash for a smoldering while,the signboard passes the unscarred road wheels on,faulkner
25419,25420,then dewey dell turns her head,the wagon creaks on,faulkner
25421,25422,cash spits over the wheel,in a couple of days now it ll be smelling he says,faulkner
25423,25424,you might tell jewel that i say,he is motionless now sitting the horse at the function upright watching us no less still than the signboard that lifts its fading capitulation opposite him,faulkner
25425,25426,it aint balanced right for no long ride cash says,tell him that too i say,faulkner
25427,25428,the wagon creaks on,a mile further along he passes us the horse archnecked reined back to a swift singlefoot,faulkner
25429,25430,he sits lightly poised upright woodenfaced in the saddle the broken hat raked at a swaggering angle,he passes us swiftly without looking at us the horse driving its hooves hissing in the mud,faulkner
25431,25432,a gout of mud backflung plops onto the box,cash leans forward and takes a tool from his box and removes it carefully,faulkner
25433,25434,when the road crosses vhiteleaf the willows leaning near enough he breaks off a branch and scours at the stain with the wet leaves,eight miles the sweat of his body washed up outen the lord s earth where the lord himself told him to put it,faulkner
25435,25436,nowhere in this sinful world can a honest hardworking man profit,it takes them that runs the stores in the towns doing no sweating living off of them that sweats,faulkner
25437,25438,it aint the hardworking man the farmer,sometimes i wonder why we keep at it,faulkner
25439,25440,it s because there is a reward for us above where they cant take their autos and such,every man will be equal there and it will be taken from them that have and give to them that have not by the lord,faulkner
25441,25442,but it s a long wait seems like,it s bad that a fellow must earn the reward of his rightdoing by flouting hisself and his dead,faulkner
25443,25444,we drove all the rest of the day and got to samson s at dustdark and then that bridge was gone too,they had nt never see the river so high and it not done raining yet there was old men that had nt never see nor hear of it being so in the memory of man,faulkner
25445,25446,i am the chosen of the lord for who he loveth so doeth he chastiseth,but i be durn if he dont take some curious ways to show it seems like,faulkner
25447,25448,but now i can get them teeth,that will be a comfort,faulkner
25449,25450,it will,we were sitting on the porch when the wagon came up the road with the five of them in it and the other one on the horse behind,faulkner
25451,25452,one of them raised his hand but they was going on past the store without stopping,who s that,faulkner
25453,25454,maccallum says i cant think of his name rate s twin that one it was,it s bundren from down beyond new hope quick says,faulkner
25455,25456,there s one of them snopes horses jewel s riding,i did nt know there was ere a one of them horses left maccallum says,faulkner
25457,25458,i thought you folks down there finally contrived to give them all away,try and get that one quick says,faulkner
25459,25460,the wagon went on,i bet old man lon never gave it to him i says,faulkner
25461,25462,no quick says,he bought it from pappy,faulkner

25473,25474,they had something in the wagon,but quick had been to the funeral three days ago and we naturally never thought anything about it except that they were heading away from home mighty late and that they had nt heard about the bridge,faulkner
25475,25476,you better holler at them maccallum says,durn it the name is right on the tip of my tongue,faulkner
25477,25478,so quick hollered and they stopped and he went to the wagon and told them,he come back with them,faulkner
25479,25480,they re going to jefferson he says,the bridge at tull s is gone too,faulkner
25481,25482,like we did nt know it and his face looked funny around the nostrils but they just sat there bundren and the girl and the chap on the seat and cash and the second one the one folks talks about on a plank across the tailgate and the other one on that spotted horse,let every man run his own business to suit himself i say,faulkner
25483,25484,but after i talked to rachel about them not having a regular man to fix her and it being july and all i went back down to the barn and tried to talk to bundren about it,i give her my promise he says,faulkner
25485,25486,her mind was set on it,i notice how it takes a lazy man a man that hates moving to get set on moving once he does get started off the same as he was set on staying still like it aint the moving he hates so much as the starting and the stopping,faulkner
25487,25488,and like he would be kind of proud of whatever come up to make the moving or the setting still look hard,he set there on the wagon hunched up blinking listening to us tell about how quick the bridge went and how high the water was and i be durn if he did nt act like he was proud of it like he had made the river rise himself,faulkner
25489,25490,you say it s higher than you ever see it before,he says,faulkner
25491,25492,god s will be done he says,i reckon it wont go down much by morning neither he says,faulkner
25493,25494,you better stay here tonight i says and get a early start for new hope tomorrow morning,i was just sorry for them bonegaunted mules,faulkner
25495,25496,i told rachel i says well would you have had me turn them away at dark eight miles from home,what else could i do i says,faulkner
25497,25498,it wont be but one night and they ll keep it in the barn and they ll sholy get started by daylight,and so i says you stay here tonight and early tomorrow you can go back to new hope,faulkner
25499,25500,i got tools enough and the boys can go on right after supper and have it dug and ready if they want and then i found that girl watching me,if her eyes had a been pistols i would nt be talking now,faulkner
25501,25502,i be dog if they did nt blaze at me,and so when i went down to the barn i come on them her talking so she never noticed when i come up,faulkner
25503,25504,you promised her she says,she would nt go until you promised,faulkner
25505,25506,she thought she could depend on you,if you dont do it it will be a curse on you,faulkner
25507,25508,cant no man say i dont aim to keep my word bundren says,my heart is open to ere a man,faulkner
25509,25510,i dont care what your heart is she says,she was whispering kind of talking fast,faulkner
25511,25512,you promised her,you ve got to,faulkner
25513,25514,you then she seen me and quit standing there,if they d been pistols i would nt be talking now,faulkner
25515,25516,her mind is set on it,her mind is set on it,faulkner
25517,25518,so i told them to drive it into the barn because it was threatening rain again and that supper was about ready,we would nt discommode you,faulkner
25519,25520,we got a little something in the basket,we can make out,faulkner
25521,25522,well i says since you are so particular about your womenfolks i am too,and when folks stops with us at meal time and wont come to the table my wife takes it as a insult,faulkner
25523,25524,so the girl went on to the kitchen to help rachel,and then jewel come to me,faulkner
25525,25526,sho i says,help yourself outen the loft,faulkner
25527,25528,feed him when you bait the mules,i ratter pay you for him he says,faulkner
25529,25530,what for,i says,faulkner
25531,25532,i would nt begrudge no man a bait for his horse,i rather pay you he says i thought he said extra,faulkner
25533,25534,extra for what i says,wont he eat hay and corn,faulkner
25535,25536,extra feed he says,i feed him a little extra and i dont want him beholden to no man,faulkner
25537,25538,you cant buy no feed from me boy i says,and if he can eat that loft clean i ll help you load the ham onto the wagon in the morning,faulkner
25539,25540,he aint never been beholden to no man he says,i rather pay you for it,faulkner
25541,25542,and if i had my rathers you would nt be here atall i wanted to say,but i just says then it s high time he commenced,faulkner
25543,25544,you cant buy no feed from me,when rachel put supper on her and the girl went and fixed some beds,faulkner
25545,25546,but would nt any of them come in,she s been dead long enough to get over that sort of foolishness i says,faulkner
25547,25548,because i got just as much respect for the dead as ere a man but you ve got to respect the dead themselves and a woman that s been dead in a box four days the best way to respect her is to get her into the ground as quick as you can,course if the boys wants to go to bed i reckon i can set up with her,faulkner
25549,25550,i dont begrudge her it,so when i went back down there they were squatting on the ground around the wagon all of them,faulkner
25551,25552,let that chap come to the house and get some sleep anyway i says,and you better come too i says to the girl,faulkner
25553,25554,i was nt aiming to interfere with them,and i sholy had nt done nothing to her that i knowed,faulkner
25555,25556,he s done already asleep bundren says,they had done put him to bed in the trough in a empty stall,faulkner
25557,25558,well you come on then i says to her,but still she never said nothing,faulkner
25559,25560,they just squatted there,you could nt hardly see them,faulkner
25561,25562,how about you boys,i says,faulkner
25563,25564,you got a full day tomorrow,we can make out,faulkner
25565,25566,we would nt be beholden bundren says,i thank you kindly,faulkner
25567,25568,so i left them squatting there,i reckon after four days they was used to it,faulkner
25569,25570,but rachel was nt,it s a outrage she says,faulkner
25571,25572,a outrage,what could he a done,faulkner
25573,25574,i says,he give her his promised word,faulkner
25575,25576,who s talking about him,she says,faulkner
25577,25578,who cares about him,she says crying,faulkner
25579,25580,you re upset,dont you touch me,faulkner
25581,25582,she says,dont you touch me,faulkner
25583,25584,a man cant tell nothing about them,i lived with the same one fifteen years and i be durn if i can,faulkner
25585,25586,and i imagined a lot of things coming up between us but i be durn if i ever thought it would be a body four days dead and that a woman,but they make me hard on them not taking it as it comes up like a man does,faulkner
25587,25588,so i laid there hearing it commence to rain thinking about them down there squatting around the wagon and the rain on the roof and thinking about rachel crying there until after a while it was like i could still hear her crying even after she was asleep and smelling it even when i knowed i could nt,i could nt decide even then whether i could or not or if it was nt just knowing it was what it was,faulkner
25589,25590,so next morning i never went down there,i heard them hitching up and then when i knowed they must be about ready to take out i went out the front and went down the road toward the bridge until i heard the wagon come out of the lot and go back toward new hope,faulkner
25591,25592,and then when i come back to the house rachel jumped on me because i was nt there to make them come in to breakfast,you cant tell about them,faulkner
25593,25594,just about when you decide they mean one tiling i be durn if you not only have nt got to change your mind like as not you got to take a rawhiding for thinking they meant it,but it was still like i could smell it,faulkner
25595,25596,and so i decided then that it was nt smelling it but it was just knowing it was there like you will get fooled now and then,but when i went to the barn i knew different when i walked into the hallway i saw something,faulkner
25597,25598,it kind of hunkered up when i come in and i thought at first it was one of them got left then i saw what it was,it was a buzzard,faulkner
25599,25600,it looked around and saw me and went on down the hall spraddlelegged with its wings kind of hunkered out watching me first over one shoulder and then over the other like a old baldheaded man,when it got outdoors it begun to fly,faulkner
25601,25602,it had to fly a long time before it ever got up into the air with it thick and heavy and full of rain like it was,if they was bent on going to jefferson i reckon they could have gone around up by mount vernon like maccallum did,faulkner
25603,25604,hell get home about day after tomorrow horseback,then they d be just eighteen miles from town,faulkner
25605,25606,but maybe this bridge being gone too has learned him the lord s sense and judgment,that maccallum,faulkner
25607,25608,he s been trading with me off and on for twelve years,i have known him from a boy up know his name as well as i do my own,faulkner
25609,25610,but be durn if i can say it,it is looking out at the road now because it can wait,faulkner
25611,25612,new hope,mi,faulkner
25613,25614,it will say,new hope,faulkner
25615,25616,mi,new hope,faulkner
25617,25618,mi,and then the road will begin curving away into the trees empty with waiting saying new hope three miles,faulkner
25619,25620,jl heard that my mother is dead,i wish i had time to let her die,faulkner
25621,25622,i wish i had time to wish i had,it is because in the wild and outraged earth too soon too soon too soon,faulkner
25623,25624,it s not that i would nt and will not it s that it is too soon too soon too soon,now it begins to say it,faulkner
25625,25626,new hope three miles,new hope three miles,faulkner
25627,25628,that s what they mean by the womb of time the agony and the despair of spreading bones the hard girdle in which lie the outraged entrails of events cash s head turns slowly as we approach his pale empty sad composed and questioning face following the red and empty curve beside the bade wheel jewel sits the horse gazing straight ahead,the land runs out of darl s eyes they swim to pinpoints,faulkner
25629,25630,they begin at my feet and rise along my body to my face and then my dress is gone i sit naked on the seat above the unhurrying mules above the travail,suppose i tell him to turn,faulkner
25631,25632,he will do what i say,dont you know he will do what i say,faulkner
25633,25634,once i waked with a black void rushing under me,i could not see,faulkner
25635,25636,i saw vardaman rise and go to the window and strike the knife into the fish the blood gushing hissing like steam but i could not see,he ll do as i say,faulkner
25637,25638,he always does,i can persuade him to anything,faulkner
25639,25640,you know i can,suppose i say turn here,faulkner
25641,25642,that was when i died that time,suppose i do,faulkner
25643,25644,we ll go to new hope,we wont have to go to town,faulkner
25645,25646,i rose and took the knife from the streaming fish still hissing and i killed darl,new hope,faulkner
25647,25648,was mi,was mi,faulkner
25649,25650,i believe in god i believe in god,why did nt we go to new hope pa,faulkner
25651,25652,vardaman says,mr samson said we was but we done passed the road,faulkner
25653,25654,darl says look jewel,but he is not looking at me,faulkner
25655,25656,he is looking at the sky,he buzzard is as still as if he were nailed to it,faulkner
25657,25658,we turn into tull s lane,we pass the barn and go on the wheels whispering in the mud passing the green rows of cotton in the wild earth and vernon little across the field behind the plow,faulkner
25659,25660,he lifts his hand as we pass and stands there looking after us for a long while,look jewel darl says,faulkner
25661,25662,jewel sits on his horse like they were both made out of wood looking straight ahead,i believe in god god,faulkner
25663,25664,god i believe in god,they was setting in the wagon at the end of the levee when i caught up with them,faulkner
25665,25666,anse was setting there looking at the bridge where it was swagged down into the river with just the two ends in sight,he was looking at it like he had believed all the time that folks had been lying to him about it being gone but like he was hoping all the time it really was,faulkner
25667,25668,kind of pleased astonishment he looked setting on the wagon in his sunday pants mumbling his mouth,looking like a uncurried horse dressed up i dont know,faulkner
25669,25670,the boy was watching the bridge where it was midsunk and logs and such drifted up over it and it swagging and shivering like the whole thing would go any minute bigeyed he was watching it like he was to a circus,and the gal too,faulkner
25671,25672,when i come up she looked around at me her eyes kind of blaring up and going hard like i had made to touch her,then she looked at anse again and then back at the water again,faulkner
25673,25674,it was nigh up to the levee on both sides the earth hid except for the tongue of it we was on going out to the bridge and then down into the water and except for knowing how the road and the bridge used to look a fellow could nt tell where was the river and where the land,it was just a tangle of yellow and the levee not less wider than a knifeback land of with us setting in the wagon and on the horse and the mule,faulkner
25675,25676,darl was looking at me and then cash turned and looked at me with that look in his eyes like when he was figuring on whether the planks would fit her that night like he was measuring them inside of him and not asking you to say what you thought and not even letting on he was listening if you did say it but listening all right,jewel had nt moved,faulkner
25677,25678,he sat there on the horse leaning a little forward with that same look on his face when him and darl passed the house yesterday coming back to get her,if it was just up we could drive across anse says we could drive right on across it,faulkner
25679,25680,sometimes a log would get shoved over the jam and float on rolling and turning and we could watch it go on to where the ford used to be,it would slow up and whirl crossways and hang out of water for a minute and you could tell by that that the ford used to be there,faulkner
25681,25682,but that dont show nothing i say,it could he a bar of quicksand built up there,faulkner
25683,25684,we watch the log,then the gal is looking at me again,faulkner
25685,25686,mr whitfield crossed it she says,he was ahorseback i say,faulkner
25687,25688,and three days ago,its riz five foot since,faulkner
25689,25690,if the bridge was just up anse says,the log bobs up and goes on again,faulkner
25691,25692,there is a lot of trash and foam and you can hear the water,but its down anse says,faulkner
25693,25694,cash says a careful fellow could walk across yonder on the planks and logs,but you could nt tote nothing i say,faulkner
25695,25696,likely time you set foot on that mess it ll all go too,what you think darl,faulkner
25697,25698,he is looking at me,he dont say nothing just looks at me with them queer eyes of hisn that makes folks talk,faulkner
25699,25700,i always say it aint never been what he done so much or said or anything so much as how he looks at you,it s like he had got into the inside of you someway,faulkner
25701,25702,like somehow you was looking at yourself and your doings outen his eyes,then i can feel that gal watching me like i had made to touch her,faulkner
25703,25704,she says something to anse,mr whitfield,faulkner
25705,25706,she says,give her my promised word in the presence of the lord anse says,faulkner
25707,25708,i reckon it aint no need to worry,but still he does not start the mules,faulkner
25709,25710,we set there above the water,another log bobs up over the jam and goes on we watch it check up and swing slow for a minute where the ford used to be,faulkner
25711,25712,then it goes on,it might start falling tonight i say,faulkner
25713,25714,you could lay over one more day,then jewel turns sideways on tie horse,faulkner
25715,25716,his face is kind of green then it would go red and then green again,get to hell on back to your damn plowing he says,faulkner
25717,25718,who the hell asked you to follow us here,i never meant no harm i say,faulkner
25719,25720,shut up jewel cash says,jewel looks back at the water his face gritted going red and green and then red,faulkner
25721,25722,well cash says after a while what you want to do,anse dont say nothing,faulkner
25723,25724,he sets humped up mumbling his mouth,if it was just up we could drive across it he says,faulkner
25725,25726,come on jewel says moving the horse,wait cash says,faulkner
25727,25728,he looks at the bridge,we look at him except anse and the gal,faulkner
25729,25730,they are looking at the water,dewey dell and vardaman and pa better walk across on the bridge cash says,faulkner
25731,25732,vernon can help them jewel says,and we can bitch his mule ahead of ourn,faulkner
25733,25734,you aint going to take my mule into that water i say,jewel looks at me,faulkner
25735,25736,his eyes look like pieces of a broken plate,ill pay for your damn mule,faulkner
25737,25738,i ll buy it from you right now,my mule aint going into that water i say,faulkner
25739,25740,jewel s going to use his horse darl says,why wont you risk your mule vernon,faulkner
25741,25742,shut up darl cash says,you and jewel both,faulkner
25743,25744,my mule aint going into that water i say,the summer when he was fifteen he took a spell of sleeping,faulkner
25745,25746,one morning when i went to feed the mules the cows were still in the tieup and then i heard pa go back to the house and call him,when we came on back to the house for breakfast he passed us carrying the milk buckets stumbling along like he was drunk and he was milking when we put the mules in and went on to the field without him,faulkner
25747,25748,we had been there an hour and still he never showed up,when dewey dell came with our lunch pa sent her back to find jewel,faulkner
25749,25750,they found him in the tieup sitting on the stool asleep,after that every morning pa would go in and wake him,faulkner
25751,25752,he would go to sleep at die supper table and soon as supper was finished he would go to bed and when i came in to bed he would be lying there like a dead man,yet still pa would have to wake him in the morning,faulkner
25753,25754,he would get up but he would nt hardly have half sense he would stand for pa s jawing and complaining without a word and take the milk buckets and go to the barn and once i found him asleep at the cow the bucket in place and half full and his hands up to the wrists in the milk and his head against the cow s flank,after that dewey dell had to do the milking,faulkner
25755,25756,he still got up when pa waked him going about what we told him to do in that dazed way,it was like he was trying hard to do them that he was as puzzled as anyone else,faulkner
25757,25758,are you sick,ma said,faulkner
25759,25760,dont you feel all right,yes jewel said,faulkner
25761,25762,i feel all right,he s just lazy trying me pa said and jewel standing there asleep on his feet like as not,faulkner
25763,25764,aint you,lie said waking jewel up again to answer,faulkner
25765,25766,no jewel said,you take off and stay in the house today ma said,faulkner
25767,25768,with that whole bottom piece to be busted out,pa said,faulkner
25769,25770,if you aint sick what s the matter with you,nothing jewel said,faulkner
25771,25772,i m all right,all right,faulkner
25773,25774,pa said,you re asleep on your feet this minute,faulkner
25775,25776,no jewel said,i m all right,faulkner
25777,25778,i want him to stay at home today ma said,ill need him pa said,faulkner
25779,25780,it s tight enough with all of us to do it,you ll just have to do the best you can with cash and darl ma said,faulkner
25781,25782,i want him to stay in today,but he would nt do it,faulkner
25783,25784,i m all right he said going on,but he was nt all right,faulkner
25785,25786,anybody could see it,he was losing flesh and i have seen him go to sleep chopping watched the hoe going slower and slower up and down with less and less of an arc until it stopped and he leaning on it motionless in the hot shimmer of the sun,faulkner
25787,25788,ma wanted to get the doctor but pa did nt want to spend the money without it was needful and jewel did seem all right except for his thinness and his way of dropping off to sleep at any moment,he ate hearty enough except for his way of going to sleep in his plate with a piece of bread halfway to his mouth and his jaws still chewing,faulkner
25789,25790,and doing them herself when pa was nt there,she would fix him special things to eat and hide them for him,faulkner
25791,25792,and that may have been when i first found it out that addie bundren should be hiding anything she did who had tried to teach us that deceit was such that in a world where it was nothing else could be very bad or very important not even poverty,and at times when i went in to go to bed she would be sitting in the dark by jewel where he was asleep,faulkner
25793,25794,and i knew that she was hating herself for that deceit and hating jewel because she had to love him so that she had to act the deceit,one night she was taken sick and when i went to the barn to put the team in and drive to lull s i could nt find the lantern,faulkner
25795,25796,i remembered noticing it on the nail the night before but it was nt there now at midnight,so i hitched in the dark and went on and came back with mrs tull just after daylight,faulkner
25797,25798,and there the lantern was hanging on the nail where i remembered it and could nt find it before,and then one morning while dewey dell was milking just before sunup jewel came into the barn from the back through the hole in the back wall with the lantern in his hand,faulkner
25799,25800,i told cash and cash and i looked at one another,rutting cash said,faulkner
25801,25802,yes i said,but why the lantern,faulkner
25803,25804,and every night too,no wonder he s losing flesh,faulkner
25805,25806,are you going to say anything to him,wont do any good cash said,faulkner
25807,25808,what he s doing now wont do any good either,i know,faulkner
25809,25810,but he ll have to learn that himself,give him time to realise that it ll save that there ll be just as much more tomorrow and he ll be all right,faulkner
25811,25812,i would nt tell anybody i reckon,no i said,faulkner
25813,25814,i told dewey dell not to,not ma anyway,faulkner
25815,25816,no,not ma,faulkner
25817,25818,after that i thought it was right comical he acting so bewildered and willing and dead for sleep and gaunt as a beanpole and thinking he was so smart with it,and i wondered who the girl was,faulkner
25819,25820,i thought of all i knew that it might be but i could nt say for sure,taint any girl cash said,faulkner
25821,25822,it s a married woman somewhere,aint any young girl got that much daring and staying power,faulkner
25823,25824,that s what i dont like about it,why,faulkner
25825,25826,i said,she ll be safer for him than a girl would,faulkner
25827,25828,more judgment,he looked at me his eyes fumbling the words fumbling at what he was trying to say,faulkner
25829,25830,it aint always the safe things in this world that a fellow,you mean the safe things are not always the best things,faulkner
25831,25832,ay best he said fumbling again,it aint the best things the things that are good for him a young boy,faulkner
25833,25834,a fellow kind of hates to see,wallowing in somebody else s mire,faulkner
25835,25836,that s what he was trying to say,when something is new and hard and bright there ought to be something a little better for it than just being safe since the safe things are just the things that folks have been doing so long they have worn the edges off and there s nothing to the doing of them that leaves a man to say that was not done before and it can not be done again,faulkner
25837,25838,so we did nt tell not even when after a while he d appear suddenly in the field beside us and go to work without having had time to get home and make out he had been in bed all night,he would tell ma that he had nt been hungry at breakfast or that he had eaten a piece of bread while he was hitching up theteam,faulkner
25839,25840,but cash and i knew that he had nt been home at all on those nights and he had come up out of the woods when we got to the field,but we did nt tell,faulkner
25841,25842,summer was almost over then we knew that when the nights began to get cool she would be done if he was nt,but when fall came and the nights began to get longer the only difference was that he would always be in bed for pa to wake him getting him up at last in that first state of semiidiocy like when it first started worse than when he had stayed out all night,faulkner
25843,25844,she s sure a stayer i told cash,i used to admire her but i downright respect her now,faulkner
25845,25846,it aint a woman he said,you know i said,faulkner
25847,25848,but he was watching me,what is it then,faulkner
25849,25850,you can trail him through the woods all night if you want to i said,i m not,faulkner
25851,25852,i aint trailing him he said,what do you call it then,faulkner
25853,25854,i aint trailing him he said,dont mean it that way,faulkner
25855,25856,and so a few nights later i heard jewel get up and climb out the window and then i heard cash get up and follow him,the next morning when i went to the barn cash was already there the mules fed and he was helping dewey dell milk,faulkner
25857,25858,and when i saw him i knew that he knew what it was,now and then i would catch him watching jewel with a queer look like having found out where jewel went and what he was doing had given him something to really think about at last,faulkner
25859,25860,but it was not a worried look it was the kind of look i would see on him when i would find him doing some of jewel s work around the house work that pa still thought jewel was doing and that ma thought dewey dell was doing,so i said nothing to him believing that when he got done digesting it in his mind he would tell me,faulkner
25861,25862,but he never did,one morning it was november then five months since it started jewel was not in bed and he did nt join us in the field,faulkner
25863,25864,that was the first time ma learned anything about what had been going on,she sent vardaman down to find where jewel was and after a while she came down too,faulkner
25865,25866,it was as though so long as the deceit ran along quiet and monotonous all of us let ourselves be deceived abetting it unawares or maybe through cowardice since all people are cowards and naturally prefer any kind of treachery because it has a bland outside,but now it was like we had all and by a kind of telepathic agreement of admitted fear flung the whole thing back like covers on the bed and we all sitting bolt upright in our nakedness staring at one another arid saying now is the truth,faulkner
25867,25868,he has nt come home,something has happened to him,faulkner
25869,25870,we let something happen to him,then we saw him,faulkner
25871,25872,he came up along the ditch and then turned straight across the field riding the horse,its mane and tail were going as though in motion they were carrying out the splotchy pattern of its coat he looked like he was riding on a big pinwheel barehacked with a rope bridle and no hat on his head,faulkner
25873,25874,it was a descendant of those texas ponies flem snopes brought here twentyfive years ago and auctioned off for two dollars a head and nobody but old lon quick ever caught his and still owned some of the blood because he could never give it away,he galloped up and stopped his heels in the horse s ribs and it dancing and swirling like the shape of its mane and tail and the splotches of its coat had nothing whatever to do with the fleshandbone horse inside them and he sat there looking at us,faulkner
25875,25876,where did you get that horse,pa said,faulkner
25877,25878,bought it jewel said,from mr quick,faulkner
25879,25880,bought it,pa said,faulkner
25881,25882,with what,did you buy that thing on my word,faulkner
25883,25884,it was my money jewel said,i earned it,faulkner
25885,25886,it s all right cash said,he earned the money he cleaned up that forty acres of new ground quick laid out last spring,faulkner
25887,25888,he did it single handed working at night by lantern,i saw him,faulkner
25889,25890,so i dont reckon that horse cost anybody anything except jewel,i dont reckon we need worry,faulkner
25891,25892,jewel ma said,jewel,faulkner
25893,25894,then she said you come right to the house and go to bed,not yet jewel said,faulkner
25895,25896,i aint got time,i got to get me a saddle and bridle,faulkner
25897,25898,mr quick says he,jewel ma said looking at him,faulkner
25899,25900,i ll give i ll give,give,faulkner
25901,25902,then she began to cry,she cried hard not hiding her face standing there in her faded wrapper looking at him and him on the horse looking down at her his face growing cold and a little sick looking until he looked away quick and cash came and touched her,faulkner
25903,25904,you go on to the house cash said,this here ground is too wet for you,faulkner
25905,25906,you go on now,she put her hands to her face then and after a while she went on stumbling a little on the plowmarks,faulkner
25907,25908,but pretty soon she straightened up and went on she did nt look back,when she reached the ditch she stopped and called vardaman,faulkner
25909,25910,he was looking at the horse land of dancing up and down by it,let me ride jewel he said,faulkner
25911,25912,let me ride jewel,jewel looked at him then he looked away again holding the horse reined back,faulkner
25913,25914,pa watched him mumbling his lip,so you bought a horse he said,faulkner
25915,25916,you went behind my back and bought a horse,you never consulted me you know how tight it is for us to make by yet you bought a horse for me to feed,faulkner
25917,25918,taken the work from your flesh and blood and bought a horse with it,jewel looked at pa his eyes paler than ever,faulkner
25919,25920,he wont never eat a mouthful of yours he said,not a mouthful,faulkner
25921,25922,ill kill him first,dont you never think it,faulkner
25923,25924,dont you never,let me ride jewel vardaman said,faulkner
25925,25926,let me ride jewel,he sounded like a cricket in the grass a little one,faulkner
25927,25928,let me ride jewel,that night i found ma sitting beside the bed where he was sleeping in the dark,faulkner
25929,25930,she cried hard maybe because she had to cry so quiet maybe because she felt the same way about tears she did about deceit hating herself for doing it hating him because she had to,and then i knew that i knew,faulkner
25931,25932,i knew that as plain on that day as i knew about dewey dell on that day,but even when we were on the bridge anse kept on looking back like he thought maybe once he was outen the wagon the whole thing would kind of blow tip and he would find himself back yonder in the field again and her laying up there in the house waiting to die and it to do all over again,faulkner
25933,25934,you ought to let them taken your mule he says and the bridge shaking and swaying under us going down into the moiling water like it went down through to the other side of the earth and the other end coming up outen the water like it was nt the same bridge atall and that them that would walk up outen the water on that side must come from the bottom of the earth,but it was still whole you could tell that by the way when this end swagged it did nt look like the other end swagged at all just like the other trees and the bank yonder were swinging back and forth slow like on a big clock,faulkner
25935,25936,and them logs scraping and bumping at the sunk part and tilting endup and shooting clean outen the water and tumbling on toward the ford and the waiting slick whirling and foamy,what good would that a done,faulkner
25937,25938,i says,if your team cant find the ford and haul it across what good would three mules or even ten mules do,faulkner
25939,25940,i aint asking it of you he says,i can always do for me and mine,faulkner
25941,25942,i aint asking you to risk your mule,it aint your dead i am not blaming you,faulkner
25943,25944,they ought to went back and laid over until tomorrow i says,the water was cold,faulkner
25945,25946,it was thick like slush ice,only it kind of lived,faulkner
25947,25948,one part of you knowed it was just water the same thing that had been running under this same bridge for a long time yet when them logs would come spewing up outen it you were not surprised like they was a part of water of the waiting and the threat,it was like when we was across up out of the water again and the hard earth under us that i was surprised,faulkner
25949,25950,it was like we had nt expected the bridge to end on the other bank on something tame like the hard earth again that we had tromped on before this time and knowed well,like it could nt be me here because i d have had better sense than to done what i just done,faulkner
25951,25952,yet here z was and the fellow that could make himself cross it twice could nt be met not even if cora told him to,a ft was that boy,faulkner
25953,25954,i said here yon better take a holt of my hand and he waited and held to me,i be dam if it was nt wee he come back and got me,faulkner
25955,25956,like he was saying they wont nothing hurt you like he was saying about a fine place he knowed where christmas come twice with thanksgiving and lasts on through the winter and the spring and the summer had all just stayed with him i d be all right too,when i looked back at my mule it was like he was one of these here spyglasses and i could look at him standing there and see all the broad land and my house sweated outen it like was the more the sweaty the broader the land the more the sweat the tighter the house because it would take a tight house for cora to hold cora like a jar of milk in the spring you ve got to have a tight jar oaf you ll need a powerful spring so if you have a big spring why dies you have the incentive to have tight wellmade jars because it is your milk soar or not because you would lather have milk that will sour than to have milk that wont because you are a man,faulkner
25957,25958,and him holding to my hand his hand that hot and confident so that i was like to say lookahere,cant you see that mule yonder,faulkner
25959,25960,he never had no business wee here so he never come not being nothing but a mule,because a fellow can see ever now and then that children have more sense than him,faulkner
25961,25962,but he dont like to admit it to them until they have beards,then we was over and we stood there looking at cash turning the wagon around,faulkner
25963,25964,we watched them drive back down the road to where the trail tamed oil into the bottom,it is sacred on me,faulkner
25965,25966,i know you begrudge it but she will bless you in heaven,well they got to finish circumventing the land before they can dare the water i said,faulkner
25967,25968,come on,it s the turning back he said,faulkner
25969,25970,it aint no luck in turning back,he was standing there humped mournful looking at the empty road beyond the swagging and swaying bridge,faulkner
25971,25972,and that gal too with the lunch basket on one arm and that package under the other,just going to town,faulkner
25973,25974,bent on it they would risk the fire and the earth and the water and all just to eat a sack of bananas,you ought to laid over a day i said,faulkner
25975,25976,it would a fell some by morning,it mought not a rained tonight and it cant get no higher,faulkner
25977,25978,i give my promise he says,it talks up to us in a murmur become ceaseless and myriad the yellow surface dimpled monstrously into fading swirls travelling along the surface for an instant silent impermanent and profoundly significant as though just beneath the surface something huge and alive waked for a moment of lazy alertness out of and into light slumber again,faulkner
25979,25980,it clucks and murmurs among the spokes and about the mules knees yellow skummed with flotsam and with thick soiled gouts of foam as though it had sweat lathering like a driven horse,through the undergrowth it goes with a plaintive sound a musing sound in it the unwinded cane and saplings lean as before a little gale swaying without reflections as though suspended on invisible wires from the branches overhead,faulkner
25981,25982,above the ceaseless surface they stand trees cane vines rootless severed from the earth spectral above a scene of immense yet circumscribed desolation filled with the voice of the waste and mournful water,cash and i sit in die wagon jewel sits the horse at the off rear wheel,faulkner
25983,25984,the horse is trembling its eye rolling wild and babyblue in its long pink face its breathing stertorous like groaning,he sits erect poised looking quietly and steadily and quickly this way and that his face calm a little pale alert,faulkner
25985,25986,cash s face is also gravely composed he and i look at one another with long probing looks looks that plunge unimpeded through one another s eyes and into the ultimate secret place where for an instant cash and darl crouch flagrant and unabashed in all the old terror and the old foreboding alert and secret and without shame,when we speak our voices are quiet detached,faulkner
25987,25988,i reckon we re still in the road all right,tull taken and cut them two big whiteoaks,faulkner
25989,25990,i heard tell how at high water in the old days they used to line up the ford by them trees,i reckon he did that two years ago when he was logging down here,faulkner
25991,25992,i reckon he never thought that anybody would ever use this ford again,i reckon not,faulkner
25993,25994,yes it must have been then,he cut a sight of timber outen here then,faulkner
25995,25996,payed off that mortgage with it i hear tell,yes,faulkner
25997,25998,yes i reckon so,i reckon vernon could have done that,faulkner
25999,26000,that s a fact,most folks that logs in this here country they need a durn good farm to support the sawmill,faulkner
26001,26002,or maybe a store,but i reckon vernon could,faulkner
26003,26004,i reckon so,he s a sight,faulkner
26005,26006,ay,vernon is,faulkner
26007,26008,yes it must still be here,he never would have got that timber out of here if he had nt cleaned out that old road,faulkner
26009,26010,i reckon we are still on it,he looks about quietly at the position of the trees leaning this way and that looking back along the floorless road shaped vaguely high in air by the position of the lopped and felled trees as if the road too had been soaked free of earth and floated upward to leave in its spectral tracing a monument to a still more profound desolation than this above which we now sit talking quietly of old security and old trivial things,faulkner
26011,26012,yes cash says not looking at me,his face is in profile as he looks forward where jewel has moved on ahead,faulkner
26013,26014,he cant miss the river i say,he could nt miss seeing it fifty yards ahead,faulkner
26015,26016,cash does not look at me his face in profile if i d just suspicioned it i could a come down last week and taken a sight on it,the bridge was up then i say,faulkner
26017,26018,he does not look at me,whitfield crossed it ahorseback,faulkner
26019,26020,jewel looks at us again his expression sober and alert and subdued,his voice is quiet,faulkner
26021,26022,what you want me to do,i ought to come down last week and taken a sight on it cash says,faulkner
26023,26024,we could nt have known i say,there was nt any way for us to know,faulkner
26025,26026,ill ride on ahead jewel says,you can follow where i am,faulkner
26027,26028,he lifts the horse,it shrinks bowed he leans to it speaking to it lifting it forward almost bodily it setting its feet down with gingerly splashings trembling breathing harshly,faulkner
26029,26030,he speaks to it murmurs to it,go on he says,faulkner
26031,26032,i aint going to let nothing hurt you,go on now,faulkner
26033,26034,jewel cash says,jewel does not look back,faulkner
26035,26036,he lifts the horse on,he can swim i say,faulkner
26037,26038,if he ll just give the horse time anyhow,when he was born he had a bad time of it ma would sit in the lamplight holding him on a pillow on her lap,faulkner
26039,26040,we would wake and find her so,there would be no sound from them,faulkner
26041,26042,that pillow was longer than him cash says,he is leaning a little forward i ought to come down last week and sighted,faulkner
26043,26044,neither his feet nor his head would reach the end of it you could nt have known,i say,faulkner
26045,26046,i ought to done it he says,he lifts the reins,faulkner
26047,26048,the mules move into the traces the wheels murmur alive in the water,he looks back and down at addie,faulkner
26049,26050,it aint on a balance he says,at last the trees open against the open river jewel sits the horse half turned it belly deep now,faulkner
26051,26052,across the river we can see vernon and pa and vardaman and dewey dell vernon is waving at us waving us further downstream,we are too high up cash says,faulkner
26053,26054,vernon is shouting too but we can not make out what he says for tie noise of the water,it runs steady and deep now tinbroken without sense of motion until a log comes along turning slowly,faulkner
26055,26056,watch it cash says,we watch it and see it falter and hang for a moment the current building up behind it in a thick wave submerging it for an instant before it shoots up and tumbles on,faulkner
26057,26058,there it is i say,ay cash says,faulkner
26059,26060,it s there,we look at vernon again,faulkner
26061,26062,he is now flapping his arms up and down,we move on downstream slowly and carefully watching vernon,faulkner
26063,26064,he drops his hands,this is the place cash says,faulkner
26065,26066,well goddamn it let s get across then jewel says he moves the horse on,you wait cash says,faulkner
26067,26068,jewel stops again,well by god he says,faulkner
26069,26070,cash looks at the water then he looks back at addie,it aint on a balance he says,faulkner
26071,26072,then go on back to the goddamn bridge and walk across jewel says,you and darl both,faulkner
26073,26074,let me on that wagon,cash does not pay him any attention,faulkner
26075,26076,it aint on a balance he says,yes sir,faulkner
26077,26078,we got to watch it,watch it hell jewel says,faulkner
26079,26080,you get out of that wagon and let me have it,by god if you re afraid to drive it over,faulkner
26081,26082,his eyes are pale as two bleached chips in his face,cash is looking at him,faulkner
26083,26084,we ll get it over he says,i tell you what you do,faulkner
26085,26086,you ride on back and walk across the bridge and come down the other bank and meet us with the rope,vernon ll take your horse home with him and keep it till we get back,faulkner
26087,26088,you go to hell jewel says,you take the rope and come down the bank and be ready with it cash says,faulkner
26089,26090,three cant do no more than two can one to drive and one to steady it,goddamn you jewel says,faulkner
26091,26092,let jewel take the end of the rope and cross upstream of us and brace it i say,will you do that jewel,faulkner
26093,26094,jewel watches me hard,he looks quick at cash then back at me his eyes alert and hard,faulkner
26095,26096,i dont give a damn,just so we do something,faulkner
26097,26098,i reckon well have to cash says,the river itself is not a hundred yards across and pa and vernon and vardaman and dewey dell are the only things in sight not of that single monotony of desolation leaning with that terrific quality a little from right to left as though we had reached the place where the motion of the wasted world accelerates just before the final precipice,faulkner
26099,26100,yet they appear dwarfed,it is as though the space between us were time an irrevocable quality,faulkner
26101,26102,it is as though time no longer running straight before us in a diminishing line now runs parallel between us like a looping string tie distance being the doubling accretion of the thread and not the interval between,the mules stand their fore quarters already sloped a little their romps high,faulkner
26103,26104,they too are breathing now with a deep groaning sound looking back once their gaze sweeps across us with in their eyes a wild sad profound and despairing quality as though they had already seen in the thick water the shape of the disaster which they could not speak and we could not see,cash turns back into the wagon,faulkner
26105,26106,he lays his hands flat on addie rocking her a little,his face is calm downsloped calculant concerned,faulkner
26107,26108,he lifts his box of tools and wedges it forward tinder the seat together we shove addie forward wedging her between the tools and the wagon bed,then he looks at me,faulkner
26109,26110,no i say,i reckon stay,faulkner
26111,26112,might take both of us,from the tool box he takes his coiled rope and carries the end twice around the seat stanchion and passes the end to me without tying it,faulkner
26113,26114,the other end he pays out to jewel who takes a turn about his saddle horn,he must force the horse down into the current,faulkner
26115,26116,it moves highkneed archnecked boring and chafing,jewel sits lightly forward his knees lifted a little again his swift alert calm gaze sweeps upon us and on,faulkner
26117,26118,he lowers the horse into the stream speaking to it in a soothing murmur,the horse slips goes under to the saddle surges to its feet again the current building up against jewel s thighs,faulkner
26119,26120,watch yourself cash says,i m oil it now jewel says,faulkner
26121,26122,you can come ahead now,cash takes the reins and lowers the team carefully and skillfully into the stream,faulkner
26123,26124,i felt the current take us and i knew we were on the ford by that reason since it was only by means of that slipping contact that we could tell that we were in motion at all,what had once been a flat surface was now a succession of troughs and hillocks lifting and falling about us shoving at us teasing at us with light lazy touches in the vain instants of solidity underfoot,faulkner
26125,26126,cash looked back at me and then i knew that we were gone,but i did not realise the reason for the rope until i saw the log,faulkner
26127,26128,it surged up out of the water and stood for an instant upright upon that surging and heaving desolation like christ,get out and let the current take you down to the bend cash said,faulkner
26129,26130,you can make it all right,upon the end of it a long gout of foam hangs like the beard of an old man or a goat,faulkner
26131,26132,when cash speaks to me i know that he has been watching it all the time watching it and watching jewel ten feet ahead of us,let the rope go he says,faulkner
26133,26134,with his other hand he reaches down and reeves the two turns from the stanchion,ride on jewel he says see if you can pull us ahead of the log,faulkner
26135,26136,jewel shouts at the horse again he appears to lift it bodily between his knees,he is just above the top of the ford and the horse has a purchase of some sort for it surges forward shining wetly half out of water crashing on in a succession of lunges,faulkner
26137,26138,it moves unbelievably fast by that token jewel realises at last that the rope is free for i can see him sawing back on the reins his head turned as the log rears in a long sluggish lunge between us bearing down upon the team,they see it too for a moment they also shine black out of water,faulkner
26139,26140,then the downstream one vanishes dragging the other with him the wagon sheers crosswise poised on the crest of the ford as the log strikes it tilting it up and on,cash is half turned the reins running taut from his hand and disappearing into the water the other hand reached back upon addie holding her jammed over against the high side of the wagon,faulkner
26141,26142,jump dear he says quietly,stay away from the team and dont try to fight it,faulkner
26143,26144,it ll swing you into the bend all right,you come too i say,faulkner
26145,26146,vernon and vardaman are running along the bank pa and dewey dell stand watching us dewey dell with the basket and the package in her arms,jewel is trying to fight the horse back,faulkner
26147,26148,the head of one mule appears its eyes wide it looks back at us for an instant making a sound almost human,the head vanishes again,faulkner
26149,26150,back jewel cash shouts,back jewel,faulkner
26151,26152,for another instant i see him leaning to the tilting wagon his arm braced back against addie and his tools i see the bearded head of the rearing log strike up again and beyond it jewel holding the horse upreared its head wrenched around hammering its head with his fist,i jump from the wagon on the downstream side,faulkner
26153,26154,between two hills i see the mules once more,they roll up out of the water in succession turning completely over their legs stiffly extended as when they had lost contact with the earth,faulkner
26155,26156,he comes a long way up slow before his hands do but he s got to have her got to so i can bear it,then his hands come up and all of him above the water,faulkner
26157,26158,i cant stop,i have not got time to try,faulkner
26159,26160,i said,you never got her,faulkner
26161,26162,you knew she is a fish but you let her get away,you never got her,faulkner
26163,26164,darl,darl,faulkner
26165,26166,darl,i began to run along the bank watching the mules dive up slow again and then down again,faulkner
26167,26168,i notice anse was too smart to been on it atall,he could nt a done no good if he d been there i said,faulkner
26169,26170,they was going about it right and they would have made it if it had nt a been for that log,log fiddlesticks cora said,faulkner
26171,26172,it was the hand of god,then how can you say it was foolish,faulkner
26173,26174,i said,nobody cant guard against the hand of god,faulkner
26175,26176,it would be sacrilege to try to,then why dare it,faulkner
26177,26178,cora says,tell me that anse did nt,faulkner
26179,26180,i said,that s just what you faulted him for,faulkner
26181,26182,his place was there cora said,one breath you say they was daring the hand of god to try it and the next breath you jump on anse because he was nt with them,faulkner
26183,26184,then she begun to sing again working at the washtub with that singing look in her face like she had done give up folks and all their foolishness and had done went on ahead of them marching up the sky singing,the wagon hung for a long time while the current built up under it shoving it off the ford and cash leaning more and more trying to keep the coffin braced so it would nt slip down and finish tilting the wagon over,faulkner
26185,26186,soon as the wagon got tilted good to where the current could finish it the log went on,it headed around the wagon and went on good as a swimming man could have done,faulkner
26187,26188,it was like it had been sent there to do a job and done it and went on,when the mules finally kicked loose it looked for a minute hike maybe cash would get the wagon back it looked like him and the wagon was nt moving at all and just jewel fighting that horse back to the wagon,faulkner
26189,26190,then that boy passed me running and hollering at darl and the gal trying to catch him and then i see the mules come rolling slow up out of the water their legs spraddled stiff like they had balked upside down and roll on into the water again,then the wagon tilted over and then it and jewel and the horse was all mixed up together,faulkner
26191,26192,cash went outen sight still holding the coffin braced and then i could nt tell anything for the horse lunging and splashing,i thought that cash had give up then and was swimming for it and i was yelling at jewel to come on back and then all of a sudden him and the horse went under too and i thought they was all going,faulkner
26193,26194,i knew that the horse had got dragged off the ford too and with that wild drowning horse and that wagon and that loose box it was going to be pretty bad and there i was standing kneedeep in the water yelling at anse behind me see what you done now,see what you done now,faulkner
26195,26196,the horse come up again,it was headed for the hank now throwing its head up and then i saw one of them holding to the saddle on the downstream side so i started running along the bank trying to catch sight of cash because he could nt swim yelling at jewel where cash was like a durn fool bad as that boy that was on down the bank still hollering at darl,faulkner
26197,26198,so i went down into the water so i could still keep some kind of a grip in the mud when i saw jewel,he was middle deep so i knew he was on the ford anyway leaning hard upstream and then i see the rope and then i see the water building up where he was holding the wagon snubbed just below the ford,faulkner
26199,26200,so it was cash holding to the horse when it come splashing and scrambling up the bank moaning and groaning like a natural man,when i come to it it was just kicking cash loose from his holt on the saddle,faulkner
26201,26202,his face turned up a second when hewas sliding back into the water,it was gray with his eyes closed and a long swipe of mud across his face,faulkner
26203,26204,then he let go and turned over in the water,he looked just like a old bundle of clothes kind of washing up and down against the bank,faulkner
26205,26206,he looked like he was laying there in the water on his face rocking up and down a little looking at something on die bottom,we could watch the rope cutting down into the water and we could feel the weight of the wagon kind of blump and lunge lazy like like it just as soon as not and that rope cutting down into the water hard as a iron bar,faulkner
26207,26208,we could hear the water hissing on it like it was red hot like it was a straight iron bar stuck into the bottom and us holding the end of it and the wagon lazing up and down kind of pushing and prodding at us like it had come around and got behind us lazy like like it just as soon as not when it made up its mind,there was a shoat come by blowed up hike a balloon one of them spotted shoats of lon quick s,faulkner
26209,26210,it bumped against the rope like it was a iron bar and bumped off and went on and,us watching that rope slanting down into the water,faulkner
26211,26212,we watched it,his eyes are closed his face is gray his hair plastered in a smooth smear across his forehead as though done with a paint brush,faulkner
26213,26214,his face appears sunken a little sagging from the bony ridges of eye sockets nose gums as though the wetting had slacked the firmness which had held the skin full his teeth set in pale gums are parted a little as if he had been laughing quietly,he lies polethin in his wet clothes a little pool of vomit at his head and a thread of it running from the corner of his mouth and down his cheek where he could nt turn his head quick or far enough until dewey dell stoops and wipes it away with the hem of her dress,faulkner
26215,26216,jewel approaches,he has the plane,faulkner
26217,26218,vernon just found the square he says,he looks down at cash dripping too,faulkner
26219,26220,aint he talked none yet,he had his saw and hammer and chalkline and rule i say,faulkner
26221,26222,i know that,jewel lays the square down,faulkner
26223,26224,pa watches him,they cant be far away pa says,faulkner
26225,26226,it all went together,was there ere a such misfortunate man,faulkner
26227,26228,jewel does not look at pa,you better call vardaman back here he says,faulkner
26229,26230,he looks at cash,then he turns and goes away,faulkner
26231,26232,get him to talk soon as he can he says so he can tell us what else there was,we return to the river,faulkner
26233,26234,the wagon is hauled clear the wheels chocked carefully we all helped it is as though upon the shabby familiar inert shape of the wagon there lingered somehow latent yet still immediate that violence which had slain the mules that drew it not an hour since above the edge of the flood,in the wagon bed it lies profoundly the long pale planks hushed a little with wetting yet still yellow like gold seen through water save for two long muddy smears,faulkner
26235,26236,we pass it and go on to the bank,one end of the rope is made fast to a tree,faulkner
26237,26238,at the edge of the stream kneedeep vardaman stands bent forward a little watching vernon with rapt absorption,he has stopped yelling and he is wet to the armpits,faulkner
26239,26240,vernon is at the other end of the rope shoulderdeep in the river looking back at vardaman further back than that he says,you git back by the tree and hold the rope for me so it cant slip,faulkner
26241,26242,vardaman backs along the rope to the tree moving blindly watching vernon,when we come up he looks at us once his eyes round and a little dazed,faulkner
26243,26244,then be looks at vernon again in that posture of rapt alertness,i got the hammer too vernon says,faulkner
26245,26246,looks like we ought to done already got that chalkline,it ought to floated,faulkner
26247,26248,floated clean away jewel says,we wont get it,faulkner
26249,26250,we ought to find the saw though,i reckon so vernon says,faulkner
26251,26252,he looks at the water,that chalkline too,faulkner
26253,26254,what else did he have,he aint talked yet jewel says entering the water,faulkner
26255,26256,he looks back at me,you go back and get him roused up to talk he says,faulkner
26257,26258,pa s there i say,i follow jewel into the water along the rope,faulkner
26259,26260,it feels alive in my hand bellied faintly in a prolonged and resonant arc,vernon is watching me,faulkner
26261,26262,you better go he says,you better be there,faulkner
26263,26264,let s see what else we can get before it washes on down i say,we hold to the rope the current curling and dimpling about our shoulders,faulkner
26265,26266,but beneath that false blandness the true force of it leans against us lazily,i had not thought that water in july could be so cold,faulkner
26267,26268,it is like hands molding and prodding at the very bones,vernon is still looking back toward the bank,faulkner
26269,26270,reckon it ll hold us all,he says,faulkner
26271,26272,we too look back following the rigid bar of the rope as it rises from the water to the tree and vardaman crouched a little beside it watching us,wish my mule would nt strike out for home vernon says,faulkner
26273,26274,come on jewel says,let s get outen here,faulkner
26275,26276,even the mud there is not still,it has a chill scouring quality as though the earth under us were in motion too,faulkner
26277,26278,we touch and fumble at one another s extended arms letting ourselves go cautiously against the rope or erect in turn watch the water suck and boil where one of the other two gropes beneath the surface,pa has come down to the shore watching us,faulkner
26279,26280,vernon comes up streaming his face sloped down into his pursed blowing mouth,his mouth is bluish like a circle of weathered rubber,faulkner
26281,26282,he has the rule,hell be glad of that i say,faulkner
26283,26284,it s right new,he bought it just last month out of the catalogue,faulkner
26285,26286,if we just knowed for sho what else vernon says looking over his shoulder and then turning to face where jewel had disappeared,did nt he go down fore me,faulkner
26287,26288,vernon says,i dont know i say,faulkner
26289,26290,i think so,yes,faulkner
26291,26292,yes he did,we watch the thick curling surface streaming away from us in slow whorls,faulkner
26293,26294,give him a pull on the rope vernon says,he s on your end of it i say,faulkner
26295,26296,aint nobody on my end of it he says,pull it in i say,faulkner
26297,26298,but he has already done that holding the end above the,water and then we see jewel,faulkner
26299,26300,he is ten yards away he comes up blowing and looks at us tossing his long hair back with a jerk of his head then he looks toward the bank we can see him filling his lungs,jewel vernon says not loud but his voice going full and clear along the water peremptory yet tactful,faulkner
26301,26302,it ll be back here,better come back,faulkner
26303,26304,jewel dives again,we stand there leaning back against the current watching the water where he disappeared holding the dead rope between us like two men holding the nozzle of a fire hose waiting for the water,faulkner
26305,26306,suddenly dewey dell is behind us in the water,you make him come back she says,faulkner
26307,26308,jewel,she says,faulkner
26309,26310,he comes up again tossing his hair back from his eyes,he is swimming now toward the bank the current sweeping him downstream quartering,faulkner
26311,26312,you jewel,dewey dell says,faulkner
26313,26314,we stand holding the rope and see t ft gain the bank and climb out,as he rises from the water he stoops and picks up something,faulkner
26315,26316,he comes back along the bank,he has found the chalkline,faulkner
26317,26318,he comes opposite us and stands there looking about as if he were seeking something,pa goes on down the bank,faulkner
26319,26320,he is going back to look at the mules again where their round bodies float and rub quietly together in the slack water within the bend,what did you do with the hammer vernon,faulkner
26321,26322,jewel says,i give it to him vernon says jerking his head at vardaman,faulkner
26323,26324,vardaman is looking after pa,then he looks at jewel with the square,faulkner
26325,26326,vernon is watching jewel,he moves toward the bank passing dewey dell and me,faulkner
26327,26328,you get on out of here i say,she says nothing looking at jewel and vernon,faulkner
26329,26330,where s the hammer,jewel says,faulkner
26331,26332,vardaman scuttles tip the bank and fetches it,it s heavier than the saw vernon says,faulkner
26333,26334,jewel is tying the end of the chalkline about the hammer shaft,hammer s got the most wood in it jewel says,faulkner
26335,26336,he and vernon face one another watching jewel s hands,and flatter too vernon says,faulkner
26337,26338,it d float three to one almost,try the plane,faulkner
26339,26340,jewel looks at vernon,vernon is tall too long and lean eye to eye they stand in their close wet clothes,faulkner
26341,26342,lon quick could look even at a cloudy sky and tell the time to ten minutes,big lon i mean not little lon,faulkner
26343,26344,why dont you get out of the water,i say,faulkner
26345,26346,it wont float like a saw jewel says,it ll float nigher to a saw than a hammer will vernon says,faulkner
26347,26348,bet you jewel says,i wont bet vernon says,faulkner
26349,26350,they stand there watching jewel s still hands,hell jewel says,faulkner
26351,26352,get the plane then,so they get the plane and tie it to the chalkline and enter the water again,faulkner
26353,26354,pa comes back along the bank,he stops for a while and looks at us hunched mournful like a failing steer or an old tall bird,faulkner
26355,26356,vernon and jewel return leaning against the current,get out of the way jewel says to dewey dell,faulkner
26357,26358,get out of the water,she crowds against me a little so they can pass jewel holding the plane high as though it were perishable the blue string trailing back over his shoulder,faulkner
26359,26360,they pass us and stop they fall to arguing quietly about just where the wagon went over,darl ought to know vernon says,faulkner
26361,26362,they look at me,i dont know i says,faulkner
26363,26364,they move on gingerly leaning against the current reading the ford with their feet,have you got a holt of the rope,faulkner
26365,26366,vernon says,jewel does not answer,faulkner
26367,26368,he glances back at the shore calculant then at the water,he flings the plane out ward letting the string run through his fingers his fingers turning blue where it runs over them,faulkner
26369,26370,when the line stops he hands it back to vernon,better let me go this time vernon says,faulkner
26371,26372,again jewel does not answer we watch him duck beneath the surf ace,jewel dewey dell whimpers,faulkner
26373,26374,it aint so deep there vernon says,he does not look back,faulkner
26375,26376,he is watching the water where jewel went under,when jewel comes up he has the saw,faulkner
26377,26378,when we pass the wagon pa is standing beside it scrubbing at the two mud smears with a handful of leaves,against the jungle jewel s horse looks like a patchwork quilt hung on a line,faulkner
26379,26380,cash has not moved,we stand above him holding the plane the saw the hammer the square the rule the chalkline while dewey dell squats and lifts cash s head,faulkner
26381,26382,cash she says cash,he opens his eyes staring profoundly up at our inverted faces,faulkner
26383,26384,if ever was such a misfortunate man pa says,look cash we say holding the tools up so he can see what else did you have,faulkner
26385,26386,he tries to speak rolling his head shutting his eyes,dewey dell wipes his mouth on the wet hem of her dress then he can speak,faulkner
26387,26388,it s his sawset jewel says,the new one he bought when he bought the rule,faulkner
26389,26390,he moves turning away,vernon looks tip after him still squatting,faulkner
26391,26392,then he rises and follows jewel down to the water,if ever was such a misfortunate man pa says,faulkner
26393,26394,he looms tall above us as we squat he looks like a figure carved clumsily from tough wood by a drunken caricaturist,it s a trial,faulkner
26395,26396,he says,but i doat begrudge her it,faulkner
26397,26398,no man can say i begrudge her it dewey dellhas kid cash s head back on the folded coat twisting his head a little to avoid the vomit beside him his tools lie,a fellow might call ft lucky it was the same leg he broke when he fell offen that church pa says,faulkner
26399,26400,from here they do not appear to violate the surface at all it is as though it had severed them both at a single blow the two torsos moving with infinitesimal and ludicrous care upon the surface,it looks peaceful like machinery does after you have watched it and listened to it for a long time,faulkner
26401,26402,as though the clotting which is you had dissolved into the myriad original motion and seeing and hearing in themselves blind and deaf fury in itself quiet with stagnation,squatting dewey dell s wet dress shapes for the dead eyes of three blind men those mammalian ludicrosities which are the horizons and the valleys of the earth,faulkner
26403,26404,she lad never been pure religious not even after that summer at the camp meeting when brother whitfield wrestled with her spirit singled her out and strove with the vanity in her mortal heart and i said to her many a time god gave you children to comfort your hard human lot and for a token of his own suffering and love for in love you conceived and bore them,i said that because she took god s love and her duty to him too much as a matter of course and such conduct is not pleasing to him,faulkner
26405,26406,i said he gave us the gift to raise our voices in his undying praise because i said there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner than over a hundred that never sinned,and she said my daily life is an acknowledgment and expiation of my sin and i said who are you to say what is sin and what is not sin,faulkner
26407,26408,it is the lord s part to judge ours to praise his mercy and his holy name in the hearing of our fellow mortals because he alone can see into the heart and just because a woman s me is right in the sight of man she cant know if there is no sin in her heart without she opens her heart to the lord and receives his grace,i said just because you have been a faithful wife is no sign that there is no sin in your heart and just because your me is hard is no sign that the lord s grace is absolving you,faulkner
26409,26410,and she said i know my own sin,i know that i deserve my punishment,faulkner
26411,26412,i do not begrudge it,and i said it is out of your vanity that you would judge sin and salvation in the lord s place,faulkner
26413,26414,it is our mortal lot to suffer and to raise our voices in praise of him who judges the sin and offers the salvation through our trials and tribulations time out of mind amen,not even after brother whitfield a godly man if ever one breathed god s breath prayed for you and strove as never a man could except him i said,faulkner
26415,26416,because it is not us that can judge our sins or know what is sin in the lord s eyes,she has had a hard me but so does every woman,faulkner
26417,26418,but you d think from the way she talked that she knew more about sin and salvation than the lord god himself than them who have strove and labored with the sin in this human world,when the only sin she ever committed was being partial to jewel that never loved her and was its own punishment in preference to darl that was touched by god himself and considered queer by us mortals and that did love her,faulkner
26419,26420,i said there is your sin,and your punishment too,faulkner
26421,26422,jewel is your punishment,but where is your salvation,faulkner
26423,26424,and life is short enough i said to win eternal grace in,and god is a jealous god,faulkner
26425,26426,it is his to judge and to mete not yours,i know she said,faulkner
26427,26428,nothing she said,he is my cross and he will be my salvation,faulkner
26429,26430,he will save me from the water and from the fire,even though i have laid down my life he will save me,faulkner
26431,26432,how do you know without you open your heart to him and lift your voice in his praise,i said,faulkner
26433,26434,then i realised that she did not mean god,i realised that out of the vanity of her heart she had spoken sacrilege,faulkner
26435,26436,and i went down on my knees right there,i begged her to kneel and open her heart and cast from ft the devil of vanity and cast herself upon the mercy of the lord,faulkner
26437,26438,but she would nt,she just sat there lost in her vanity and her pride that had closed her heart to god and set that selfish mortal boy in his place,faulkner
26439,26440,kneeling there i prayed for her,i prayed for that poor blind woman as i had never prayed for me and mine,faulkner
26441,26442,it would he quiet there then with the water bubbling up and away and the sun slanting quiet in the trees and the quiet smelling of damp and rotting leaves and new earth especially in the early spring for it was worst then,i could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time and when i would have to look at them day after day each with his and her secret and selfish thought and blood strange to each other blood and strange to mine and think that this seemed to be the only way i could get ready to stay dead i would hate my father for having ever planted me,faulkner
26443,26444,i would look forward to the times when they faulted so i could whip them,when the switch fell i could feel it upon my flesh when it welted and ridged it was my blood that ran and i would think with each blow of the switch now you are aware of me now i am something in your secret and selfish life who have marked your blood with my own for ever and ever,faulkner
26445,26446,and so i took anse,i saw him pass the school house three or four times before i learned that he was driving four miles out of his way to do it,faulkner
26447,26448,i noticed then how he was beginning to hump a tall man and young so that he looked already like a tall bird hunched in the cold weather on the wagon seat he would pass the school house the wagon creaking slow his head turning slow to watch the door of the school house as the wagon passed until he went on around the curve and out of sight,one day i went to the door and stood there when he passed,faulkner
26449,26450,when he saw me he looked quickly away and did not look back again,in the early spring it was worst,faulkner
26451,26452,sometimes i thought that i could not bear it lying in bed at night with the wild geese going north and their honking coming faint and high and wild out of the wild darkness and during the day it would seem as though i could nt wait for the last one to go so i could go down to the spring,i aint got none he said,faulkner
26453,26454,you have nt got any,but you ve got a house,faulkner
26455,26456,they tell me you ve got a house and a good farm,and you live there alone doing for yourself do you,faulkner
26457,26458,he just looked at me turning the hat in his hands,a new house i said,faulkner
26459,26460,are you going to get married,and he said again holding his eyes to mine that s what i come to see you about,faulkner
26461,26462,later he told me i aint got no people,so that wont be no worry to you,faulkner
26463,26464,i dont reckon you can say the same,no,faulkner
26465,26466,i have people,in jefferson,faulkner
26467,26468,his face fell a little,well i got a little property,faulkner
26469,26470,i m forehanded i got a good honest name,i know how town folks are but maybe when they talk to me,faulkner
26471,26472,they might listen i said,but they ll be hard to talk to,faulkner
26473,26474,he was watching my face,they re in the cemetery,faulkner
26475,26476,but your living kin he said,they ll be different,faulkner
26477,26478,will they,i said,faulkner
26479,26480,dont know,i never had any other kind,faulkner
26481,26482,so i took anse,and when i knew that i had cash i knew that living was terrible and that this was the answer to it,faulkner
26483,26484,that was when i learned that words are no good that words dont ever fit even what they are trying to say at,when he was born i knew that motherhood was invented by someone who had to have a word for it because the ones that had the children did nt care whether there was a word for it or not,faulkner
26485,26486,i knew that fear was invented by someone that had never had the fear pride who never had the pride,i knew that it had been not that they had dirty noses but that we had had to use one another by words like spiders dangling by their mouths from a beam swinging and twisting and never touching and that only through the blows of die switch could my blood and their blood flow as one stream,faulkner
26487,26488,i knew that it had,been not that my aloneness had to be violated over and over each day but that it had never been violated until cash came,faulkner
26489,26490,not even by anse in the nights,he had a word too,faulkner
26491,26492,love he called it,but i had been used to words for a long time,faulkner
26493,26494,i knew that that word was like the others just a shape to fill a lack that when the right time came you would nt need a word for that anymore than for pride or fear,cash did not need to say it to me nor i to him and i would say let anse use it if he wants to,faulkner
26495,26496,so that it was anse or love love or anse it did nt matter,i would think that even while i lay with him in the dark and cash asleep in the cradle within the swing of my hand,faulkner
26497,26498,i would think that if he were to wake and cry i would suckle him too,anse or love it did nt matter,faulkner
26499,26500,my aloneness had been violated and then made whole again by the violation time anse love what you will outside the circle,then i found that i had darl at first i would not believe it,faulkner
26501,26502,then i believed that i would kill anse,it was as though he had tricked me hidden within a word like within a paper screen and struck me in the back through it,faulkner
26503,26504,but then i realised that i had been tricked by words older than anse or love and that the same word had tricked anse too and that my revenge would be that he would never know i was taking revenge,and when darl was born i asked anse to promise to take me back to jefferson when i died because i knew that father had been right even when he could nt have known he was right anymore than i could have known i was wrong,faulkner
26505,26506,nonsense anse said you and me aint nigh done chapping yet with just two,he did not know that he was dead then a sometimes i would lie by him in the dark hearingdie land that was now of my blood and flesh and i would mink anse,faulkner
26507,26508,why anse,why are you anse,faulkner
26509,26510,i would think about his name until after a while i could see the word as a shape a vessel and i would watch him liquefy and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out of the darkness into the vessel until the jar stood full and motionless a significant shape profoundly without me like an empty door frame and then i would find that i had forgotten the name of the jar,i would think the shape of my body where i used to be a virgin is in the shape of a and i could nt think anse could nt remember anse,faulkner
26511,26512,it was not that i could think of myself as no longer unvirgin because i was three now,and when i would think cash and darl that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away i would say all light,faulkner
26513,26514,it does nt matter,it does nt matter what they call them,faulkner
26515,26516,and so when cora tull would tell me i was not a true mother i would think how words go straight up in a thin line quick and harmless and how terribly doing goes along the earth clinging to it so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other and that sin and love and fear arejust sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and can not have until they forget the words lake cora who could never even cook,i gave anse the children,faulkner
26517,26518,i did not ask for them,i did not even ask him for what he could have given me notanse,faulkner
26519,26520,that was my duty to him to not ask that and that duty i fulfilled,i would be i i would let him be the shape and echo of his word,faulkner
26521,26522,that was more than he asked because he could not have asked for that and been anse using himself so with a word,and then he died,faulkner
26523,26524,he did not know he was dead,i would lie by him in the dark hearing the dark land talking of cod s love and his beauty and his sin hearing the dark voicelessness in which the words are the deeds and the other words that are not deeds that are just the gaps in peoples lacks coming down like the cries of the geese out of the wild darkness in the old terrible nights fumbling at the deeds like orphans to whom are pointed out in a crowd two faces and told that is your father your mother,faulkner
26525,26526,i believed that i had found it,i believed that the reason was the duty to the alive to the terrible blood the red bitter flood boiling through the land,faulkner
26527,26528,i would think of sin as i would think of the clothes we both wore in the world s face of the circumspection necessary because he was he and i was i the sin the more utter and terrible since he was the instrument ordained by god who created the sin to sanctify that sin he had created,while i waited for him in the woods waiting for him before he saw me i would think of him as dressed in sin,faulkner
26529,26530,i would think of him as thinking of me as dressed also in sin he the more beautiful since the garment which he had exchanged for sin was sanctified,i would think of the sin as garments which we would remove in order to shape and coerce the terrible blood to the forlorn echo of the dead word high in the air,faulkner
26531,26532,then i would lay with anse again i did not lie to him i just refused just as i refused my breast to cash and darl after their time was up hearing the dark land talking the voiceless speech,i hid nothing,faulkner
26533,26534,i tried to deceive no one,i would not have cared,faulkner
26535,26536,i merely took the precautions that he thought necessary for his sake not for my safety but just as i wore clothes in the world s face,and i would think then when cora talked to me of how the high dead words in time seemed to lose even the significance of their dead sound,faulkner
26537,26538,then it was over,over in the sense that he was gone and i knew that see him again though i would i would never again see him coming swift and secret to me in the woods dressed in sin like a gallant garment already blowing aside with the speed of his secret coming,faulkner
26539,26540,but for me it was not over,i mean over in the sense of beginning and ending because to me there was no beginning nor ending to anything then,faulkner
26541,26542,i even held anse refraining still not that i was holding him recessional but as though nothing else had ever been,my children were of me alone of the wild blood boiling along the earth of me and of all that lived of none and of all,faulkner
26543,26544,then i found that i had jewel,when i waked to remember to discover it he was two months gone,faulkner
26545,26546,my father said that the reason for living is getting ready to stay dead i knew at last what he meant and that he could not have known what he meant himself because a man can not know anything about cleaning up the house afterward,and so i have cleaned my house,faulkner
26547,26548,with jewel i lay by the lamp holding up my own head watching him cap and suture it before he breathed the wild blood boiled away and the sound of it ceased,then there was only the milk warm and calm and i lying calm in the slow silence getting ready to clean my house,faulkner
26549,26550,i gave anse dewey dell to negative jewel,then i gave him vardaman to replace the child i had robbed him of,faulkner
26551,26552,and now he has three children that are his and not mine,and then i could get ready to die,faulkner
26553,26554,one day i was talking to cora,she prayed for me because she believed i was blind to sin wanting me to kneel and pray too because people to whom sin is just a matter of words to them salvation is just words too,faulkner
26555,26556,i woke to the enormity of my sin i saw the true light at last and i fell on my knees and confessed to god and asked his guidance and received it,rise he said repair to that home in which you have put a living lie among those people with whom you have outraged my word confess your sin aloud,faulkner
26557,26558,it is for them for that deceived husband to forgive you not i,so i went,faulkner
26559,26560,i heard that tull s bridge was gone i said thanks o lord o mighty ruler of all for by those dangers and difficulties which i should have to surmount i saw that he had not abandoned me that my reception again into his holy peace and love would be the sweeter for it,just let me not perish before i have begged the forgiveness of the man whom i betrayed i prayed let me not be too late let not the tale of min and her transgression come from her lips instead of mine,faulkner
26561,26562,she had sworn then that she would never tell it but eternity is a fearsome thing to face have i not wrestled thigh to thigh with satan myself,let me not have also the sin of her broken vow upon my soul,faulkner
26563,26564,let not the waters of thy mighty wrath encompass me until i have cleansed my soul in the presence of them whom i injured,it was his hand that bore me safely above the flood that fended from methe dangers of the waters,faulkner
26565,26566,my horse was frightened and my own heart failed me as the logs and the uprooted trees bore down upon my littleness,but not my soul time after time i saw them averted at destruction s final instant and i lifted my voice above the noise of the flood praise to thee o mighty lord and king,faulkner
26567,26568,by this token shall i cleanse my soul and gain again into the fold of thy undying love,i knew then that forgiveness was mine,faulkner
26569,26570,the flood the danger behind and as i rode on across the firm earth again and the scene of my gethsemane drew closer and closer i framed the words which i should use,i would enter the house i would stop her before she had spoken i would say to her husband anse i have sinned,faulkner
26571,26572,do with me as you will,it was already as though it were done,faulkner
26573,26574,my soul felt freer quieter than it had in years already i seemed to dwell in abiding peace again as i rode on,to either side i saw his hand in my heart i could hear his voice courage,faulkner
26575,26576,i am with thee,then i reached tull s house,faulkner
26577,26578,his youngest girl came out and called to me as i was passing,she told me that she was already dead,faulkner
26579,26580,i have sinned o lord,thou knowest the extent of my remorse and the will of my spirit,faulkner
26581,26582,but he is merciful he will accept the will for the deed who knew mat when i framed the words of my confession it was to anse i spoke them even though he was not there,it was he in his infinite wisdom that restrained the tale from her dying lips as she lay surrounded by those who loved and trusted her mine the travail by water which i sustained by the strength of his hand,faulkner
26583,26584,praise to thee in thy bounteous and omnipotent love praise,i entered the house of bereavement the lowly dwelling where another erring mortal lay while her soul faced the awful and irrevocable judgment peace to her ashes,faulkner
26585,26586,god s grace upon this house i said,we hitched up and laid cash on top of addie,faulkner
26587,26588,when we laid him down he vomited again but he got his head over the wagon bed in time,he taken a lick in the stomach too vernon said,faulkner
26589,26590,the horse may have kicked him in the stomach too i said,did he kick you in the stomach cash,faulkner
26591,26592,he tried to say something,dewey dell wiped his mouth again,faulkner
26593,26594,what s he say,vernon said,faulkner
26595,26596,what is it cash,dewey dell said,faulkner
26597,26598,she leaned down,his tools she said,faulkner
26599,26600,vernon got them and put them into the wagon,dewey dell lifted cash s head so he could see,faulkner
26601,26602,we drove on dewey dell and i sitting beside cash to steady him and he riding on ahead on the horse,vernon stood watching us for a while,faulkner
26603,26604,then he turned and went back toward the bridge,he walked gingerly beginning to flap the wet sleeves of his shirt as though he had just got wet,faulkner
26605,26606,he was sitting the horse before the gate,armstid was waiting at the gate,faulkner
26607,26608,we stopped and he got down and we lifted cash down and carried him into the house where mrs armstid had the bed ready,we left her and dewey dell undressing him,faulkner
26609,26610,we followed pa out to the wagon,he went back and got into the wagon and drove on we following on foot into the lot,faulkner
26611,26612,the wetting had helped because armstid said you re welcome to the house,you can put it there,faulkner
26613,26614,he followed leading the horse and stood beside the wagon the reins in his hand,i thank you pa said,faulkner
26615,26616,we ll use in the shed yonder,i know it s a imposition on you,faulkner
26617,26618,you re welcome to the house armstid said,he had that wooden look on his face again that bold surly highcolored rigid look like his face and eyes were two colors of wood the wrong one pale and the wrong one dark,faulkner
26619,26620,we took the team out and rolled the wagon bade under the shed,one side of the shed was open,faulkner
26621,26622,it wont rain under armstid said,but if you d rather,faulkner
26623,26624,back of the barn was some rusted sheets of tin roofing,we took two of them and propped them against the open side,faulkner
26625,26626,you re welcome to the house armstid said,i thank you pa said,faulkner
26627,26628,i d take it right kind if you d give them a little snack,sho armstid said,faulkner
26629,26630,pa would nt come in the house,come in and eat armstid said,faulkner
26631,26632,it s nigh ready,i would nt crave nothing pa said,faulkner
26633,26634,thank you,you come in and dry and eat armstid said,faulkner
26635,26636,it ll be all right here,it s for her pa said,faulkner
26637,26638,it s for her sake i am taking the food,i got no team no nothing,faulkner
26639,26640,but she will be grateful to ere a one of you,sho armstid said,faulkner
26641,26642,you folks come in and dry,but after armstid gave pa a drink he felt better and when we went in to see about cash he had nt come in with us,faulkner
26643,26644,when i looked back he was leading the horse into the barn he was already talking about getting another team and by supper time he had good as bought it,he is down there in the barn sliding fluidly past the gaudy lunging swirl into the stall with it,faulkner
26645,26646,he climbs onto the manger and drags the hay down and leaves the stall and seeks and finds the currycomb,then he returns and slips quickly past the single crashing thump and up against the horse where it can not overreach,faulkner
26647,26648,he applies the currycomb holding himself within the horse s striking radius with the agility of an acrobat cursing the horse in a whisper of obscene caress,picking and choosing he were by then saying how he did nt nice this span and would nt put his money in nothing soandso owned not even a hen coop,faulkner
26649,26650,you might try snopes i said,he s got threefour span,faulkner
26651,26652,maybe one of them would suit you,then he begun to mumble his mouth looking at me nice it was me that owned the only span of mules in the county and would nt sell them to him when i knew that like as not it would be my team that would ever get them out of the lot at all,faulkner
26653,26654,only i dont know what they would do with them if they had a team,littlejohn had told me that the levee through haley bottom had done gone for two miles and that the only way to get to jefferson would be to go around by mottson,faulkner
26655,26656,but that was anse s business,he s a dose man to trade with he says mumbling his mouth,faulkner
26657,26658,but when i give him another sup after supper he cheered up some,he was aiming to go back to the barn and set up with her,faulkner
26659,26660,maybe he thought that if he just stayed down there ready to take out santa claus would maybe bring him a span of mules,but i reckon i can talk him around he says,faulkner
26661,26662,a manll always help a fellow in a tight if he s got ere a drop of christian blood in him,of course you re welcome to the use of mine i said me knowing how much he believed that was the reason,faulkner
26663,26664,i thank you he said,shell want to go in ourn and him knowing how much i believed that was the reason,faulkner
26665,26666,after supper jewel rode over to the bend to get peabody,i heard he was to be there today at varner s,faulkner
26667,26668,jewel come back about midnight,peabody had gone down below inverness somewhere but uncle billy come back with him with his satchel of horse physic,faulkner
26669,26670,like he says a man aint so different from a horse or a mule come long come short except a mule or a horse has got a little more sense,what you been into now boy,faulkner
26671,26672,he says looking at cash,get me a mattress and a chair and a glass of whisky he says,faulkner
26673,26674,he made cash drink the whisky then he run anse out of the room,lucky it was the same leg he broke last summer anse says mournful mumbling and blinking,faulkner
26675,26676,that s something,we folded the mattress across cash s legs and set the chair on the mattress and me and jewel set on the chair and the gal held the lamp and uncle billy taken a chew of tobacco and went to work,faulkner
26677,26678,cash fought pretty hard for a while until he fainted,then he laid still with big balls of sweat standing on his face like they had started to roll down and then stopped to wait for him,faulkner
26679,26680,when he waked up uncle billy had done packed up and left,he kept on trying to say something until the gal leaned down and wiped his mouth,faulkner
26681,26682,it s his tools she said,i brought them in darl said,faulkner
26683,26684,i got them,he tried to talk again she leaned down,faulkner
26685,26686,he wants to see them she said,so darl brought them in where he could see them,faulkner
26687,26688,they shoved them under the side of the bed where he could reach his hand and touch them when he felt better,next morning anse taken that horse and rode over to the bend to see snopes,faulkner
26689,26690,him and jewel stood in the lot talking a while then anse got on the horse and rode off,i reckon that was the first time jewel ever let anybody ride that horse and until anse come back he hung around in that swoleup way watching the road like he was half a mind to take out after anse and get the horse back,faulkner
26691,26692,along toward nine oclock it begun to get hot,that was when i see the first buzzard,faulkner
26693,26694,because of the wetting i reckon,anyway it was nt until well into the day that i see them,faulkner
26695,26696,lucky the breeze was setting away from the house so it was nt until well into the morning,but soon as i see them it was like i could smell it in the field a mile away from just watching them and them circling and circling for everybody in the county to see what was in my barn,faulkner
26697,26698,i was still a good half a mile from the house when i heard that boy yelling,i thought maybe he might have fell into the well or something so i whipped op and come into the lot on the lope,faulkner
26699,26700,there must have been a dozen of them setting along the ridgepole of the bam and that boy was chasing another one around the lot like it was a turkey and it just lifting enough to dodge him and go flopping bade to the roof of the shed again where he had found it setting on the coffin,it s a outrage,faulkner
26701,26702,that s what i aim to do i said,it s a outrage she said,faulkner
26703,26704,he should be for treating her so,he s getting her into the ground the best he can i said,faulkner
26705,26706,so i found jewel and asked him if he did nt want to take one of the mules and go over to the bend and see about anse,he did nt say nothing,faulkner
26707,26708,he just looked at me with his jaws going bonewhite and them bonewhite eyes of hisn then he went and begun to call darl,what you fixing to do,faulkner
26709,26710,i said,he did nt answer,faulkner
26711,26712,darl come out,come on jewel said,faulkner
26713,26714,what you aim to do,darl said,faulkner
26715,26716,going to move the wagon jewel said over his shoulder,dont be a fool i said,faulkner
26717,26718,i never meant nothing,could nt help it and darl hung back too but nothing wouldd nt suit jewel,faulkner
26719,26720,shut your goddamn mouth he says,it s got to be somewhere darl said,faulkner
26721,26722,well take out soon as pa gets back,you wont help me,faulkner
26723,26724,jewel says them white eyes of hisn kind of blaring and his face shaking like he had a aguer,no darl said,faulkner
26725,26726,i wont wait till pa gets back,so i stood in the door and watched him push and pull at that wagon,faulkner
26727,26728,it was on a downhill and once i thought he was fixing to beat out the back end of the shed,then the dinner bell rung,faulkner
26729,26730,i called him but he did nt look around,come on to dinner i said,faulkner
26731,26732,tell that boy,but he did nt answer so i went on to dinner,faulkner
26733,26734,the gal went down to get that boy but she come back without him,about half through dinner we heard him yelling again running that buzzard out,faulkner
26735,26736,it s a outrage lula said a outrage,he s doing the best he can i said,faulkner
26737,26738,a fellow dont trade with snopes in thirty minutes,they ll set in die shade all afternoon to dicker,faulkner
26739,26740,do,she says,faulkner
26741,26742,do,he s done too much already,faulkner
26743,26744,and i reckon he had,trouble is his quitting was just about to start our doing,faulkner
26745,26746,he could nt buy no team from nobody let alone snopes withouten he had something to mortgage he did nt know would mortgage yet,he looked kind of funny kind of more hangdog than common and kind of proud too,faulkner
26747,26748,you bought a team from snopes,i said,faulkner
26749,26750,i reckon snopes aint the only man in this country that can drive a trade he said,sho i said,faulkner
26751,26752,he was looking at jewel with that funny look but jewel had done got down from the porch and was going toward the horse,to see what anse had done to it i reckon,faulkner
26753,26754,jewel anse says,jewel looked back,faulkner
26755,26756,come here anse says,he said,faulkner
26757,26758,so you got a team from snopes i said,hell send them over tonight i reckon,faulkner
26759,26760,you ll want a early start tomorrow long as you ll have to go by mottson,then he quit looking like he had been for a while,faulkner
26761,26762,he got that badgered look like he used to have mumbling his mouth,i do the best i can he said,faulkner
26763,26764,fore god if there were ere a man in the living world suffered the trials and floutings i have suffered,a fellow that just beat snopes in a trade ought to feel pretty good i said,faulkner
26765,26766,what did you give him anse,he did nt look at me,faulkner
26767,26768,i give a chattel mortgage on my cultivator and seeder he said,but they aint worth forty dollars,faulkner
26769,26770,how far do you aim to get with a forty dollar team,they were all watching him now quiet and steady,faulkner
26771,26772,jewel was stopped halfway back waiting to go on to the horse,i give other things anse said,faulkner
26773,26774,he begun to mumble his mouth again standing there like he was waiting for somebody to hit him and him with his mind already made up not to do nothing about it,what other things,faulkner
26775,26776,darl said,hell i said,faulkner

26783,26784,jewel had come back now standing there looking at anse with them marble eyes of hisn,cash aimed to buy that talking machine from suratt with that money darl said,faulkner
26785,26786,anse stood there mumbling his mouth,jewel watched him,faulkner

26789,26790,that still wont buy a team,anse looked at jewel quick kind of sliding his eyes that way then he looked down again,faulkner
26791,26792,god knows if there were ere a man he says,still they did nt say nothing,faulkner
26793,26794,they just watched him waiting and hire sliding his eyes toward their feet and up their legs but no higher,and the horse he says,faulkner
26795,26796,what horse,jewel said,faulkner
26797,26798,anse just stood there,i be durn if a man cant keep the upper hand of his sons he ought to run them away from home no matter how big they are,faulkner
26799,26800,and if he cant do that i be durn if he ought nt to leave himself,i be durn if i would nt,faulkner
26801,26802,you mean you tried to swap my horse,jewel says,faulkner
26803,26804,anse stands there danglearmed,for fifteen years i aint had a tooth in my head he says,faulkner
26805,26806,god knows it,i give that money,faulkner
26807,26808,i thought that if i could do without eating my sons could do without riding,god knows i did,faulkner
26809,26810,jewel stands with his hands on his hips looking at anse,then he looks away,faulkner
26811,26812,he looked out across the field his face still as a rode like it was somebody else talking about somebody else s horse and him not even listening,then he spit slow and said hell and he turned and went on to the gate and unhitched the horse and got on it,faulkner
26813,26814,it was moving when he come into the saddle and by the time he was on it they was tearing down the road like the law might have been behind them,they went out of sight that way the two of them looking like some kind of a spotted cyclone,faulkner
26815,26816,well i says,you take my team i said,faulkner
26817,26818,but he would nt do it and they would nt even stay and that boy chasing them buzzards all day in the hot sun until he was nigh as crazy as the rest of them,leave cash here anyway i said,faulkner
26819,26820,but they would nt do that they made a pallet for him with quilts on top of the coffin and laid him on it and set his tools by him and we put my team in and hauled the wagon about a mile down the road,if well bother you here anse says just say so,faulkner
26821,26822,sho i said,it ll be fine here,faulkner

26827,26828,i said,we brought it from home,faulkner
26829,26830,but it ll be stale now i said,come and get some hot victuals,faulkner
26831,26832,but they would nt come,reckon we can make out anse said,faulkner
26833,26834,so i went home and et and taken a basket back to them and tried again to make them come back to the house,i thank you he said,faulkner
26835,26836,i reckon we can make out,so i left them there squatting around a little fire waiting god knows what for,faulkner
26837,26838,i come on home,i kept thinking about them there and about that fellow tearing away on that horse,faulkner
26839,26840,and that would be the last they would see of him,and i be durn if i could blame him,faulkner
26841,26842,not for wanting to not give up his horse but for getting shut of such a durn fool as anse,or that s what i thought then,faulkner
26843,26844,because be durn if there aint something about a durn fellow like anse that seems to make a man have to help him even when he knows hell be wanting to kick himself next minute,because about a hour after breakfast next morning eustace grimm that works snopes place come up with a span of mules hunting anse,faulkner
26845,26846,i thought him and anse never traded i said,sho eustace said,faulkner
26847,26848,all they liked was the horse,i said,faulkner

26929,26930,now there are nine of them tall in little black circles,when we come to the foot of the hill pa stops and darl and dewey dell and i get out,faulkner
26931,26932,cash cant walk because he has a broken leg,come up mules pa says,faulkner
26933,26934,the mules walk hard tie wagon creaks,darl and dewey dell and i walk behind the wagon up the hill,faulkner
26935,26936,when we come to the top of the hill pa stops and we get back into the wagon,now there are ten of them tall in little tall black circles on the sky,faulkner
26937,26938,not close to the glass and not looking at anything in particular just standing there with her head turned this way and her eyes full on me and kind blank too like she was waiting for a sign,when i looked up again she was moving toward the door,faulkner
26939,26940,she kind of bumbled at the screen door a minute like they do and came in,she had on a stiffbrimmed straw hat setting on the top of her head and she was carrying a package wrapped in newspaper i thought that she had a quarter or a dollar at the most and that after she stood around a while she would maybe buy a cheap comb or a bottle of nigger toilet water so i never disturbed her for a minute or so except to notice that she was pretty in a kind of sullen awkward way and that she looked a sight better in her gingham dress and her own complexion than she would after she bought whatever she would finally decide on,faulkner
26941,26942,or tell that she wanted,i knew that she had already decided before she came in,faulkner
26943,26944,but you have to let them take their time,so i went on with what i was doing figuring to let albert wait on her when he caught up at the fountain when he came back to me,faulkner
26945,26946,that woman he said,you better see what she wants,faulkner
26947,26948,what does she want,i said,faulkner
26949,26950,i dont know,i cant get anything out of her,faulkner
26951,26952,you better wait on her,so i went around the counter,faulkner
26953,26954,i saw that she was barefooted standing with her feet flat and easy on the floor like she was used to it,she was looking at me hard holding the package i saw she had about as black a pair of eyes as ever i saw and she was a stranger,faulkner
26955,26956,i never remembered seeing her in mottson before,what can i do for you,faulkner
26957,26958,i said,still she did nt say anything,faulkner
26959,26960,she stared at me without winking,then she looked back at the folks at the fountain,faulkner
26961,26962,then she looked past me toward the back of the store,do you want to look at some toilet things,faulkner
26963,26964,i said,or is it medicine you want,faulkner
26965,26966,that s it she said,she looked quick back at the fountain again,faulkner
26967,26968,so i thought maybe her ma or somebodyhad sent her in for some of this female dope and she was ashamed to ask for it,i knew she could nt have a complexion like hers and use it herself let alone not being much more than old enough to barely know what it was for,faulkner
26969,26970,it s a shame the way they poison themselves with it,but a man s got to stock it or go out of business in this country,faulkner
26971,26972,oh i said,what do you use,faulkner
26973,26974,we have she looked at me again almost like she had said hush and looked toward the back of the store again,i d liefer go back there she said,faulkner
26975,26976,all right i said,you have to humor them,faulkner
26977,26978,you save time by it,i followed her to the back,faulkner
26979,26980,she put her hand on the gate,there s nothing back there but the prescription case i said,faulkner
26981,26982,what do you want,she stopped and looked at me,faulkner
26983,26984,it was like she had taken some kind of a lid off her face her eyes,it was her eyes kind of dumb and hopeful and sullenly willing to be disappointed all at the same time,faulkner
26985,26986,but she was in trouble of some sort i could see that,what s your trouble,faulkner
26987,26988,i said,tell me what it is you want,faulkner
26989,26990,i m pretty busy,i was nt meaning to hurry her but a man just has nt got the time they have out there,faulkner
26991,26992,it s the female trouble she said,oh i said,faulkner
26993,26994,is that all,i thought maybe she was younger than she looked and her first one had scared her or maybe one had been a little abnormal as it will in young women,faulkner
26995,26996,where s your ma,i said,faulkner
26997,26998,have nt you got one,she s out yonder in the wagon she said,faulkner
26999,27000,why not talk to her about it before you take any medicine i said,any woman would have told you about it,faulkner
27001,27002,she looked at me and i looked at her again and said how old are you,seventeen she said,faulkner
27003,27004,oh i said,i thought maybe you were,faulkner
27005,27006,she was watching me,are you too regular or not regular enough,faulkner
27007,27008,she quit looking at me but she did nt move,yes she said,faulkner
27009,27010,i reckon so,yes,faulkner
27011,27012,well which,i said,faulkner
27013,27014,dont you know,it s a crime and a shame but after all they ll buy it from somebody,faulkner
27015,27016,she stood there not looking at me,you,faulkner
27017,27018,want something to stop it,i said,faulkner
27019,27020,is that it,no she said,faulkner
27021,27022,that s it,it s already stopped,faulkner
27023,27024,well what her face was lowered a little still like they do in all their dealings with a man so hedont ever know just where the lightning will strikenext,you are not married are you,faulkner
27025,27026,i said,no,faulkner
27027,27028,oh i said,and how long has it been since it stopped,faulkner
27029,27030,about five months maybe,it aint been but two she said,faulkner
27031,27032,well i have nt got anything in my store you want to buy i said unless it s a nipple,and i d adviseyou to buy that and go back home and tell your pa if you have one and let him make somebody buy you,faulkner
27033,27034,a wedding license was that all you wanted,but she just stood there not looking at me,faulkner
27035,27036,i got the money to pay you she said,is it your own or did he act enough of a man togive you the money,faulkner
27037,27038,he give it to me,ten dollars,faulkner
27039,27040,he said that would be enough,a thousand dollars would nt be enough in my storeand ten cents would nt be enough i said,faulkner
27041,27042,you take my advice and go home and tell your pa or your brothers if you have any or the first man you come to in the road,but she did nt move,faulkner
27043,27044,lafe said i could get it at the drugstore,he said to tell you me and him would nt never tell nobody you sold it to us,faulkner
27045,27046,and i just wish your precious lafe had come for it himself that s what i wish,i dont know i d have had a little respect for him then,faulkner
27047,27048,and you can go back and tell him i said so if he aint halfway to texas by now which i dont doubt,me a respectable druggist that s kept store and raised a family and been a churchmember for fiftysix years in this town,faulkner
27049,27050,i m a good mind to tell your folks myself if i can just find who they are,she looked at me now her eyes and face kind of blank again like when i first saw her through the window,faulkner
27051,27052,i did nt know she said,he told me i could get something at the drugstore,faulkner
27053,27054,he said they might not want to sell it to me but if i had ten dollars and told them i would nt never tell nobody,if he did or mentioned my name i defy him to prove it,faulkner
27055,27056,i defy him to repeat it or i ll prosecute him to the full extent of the law and you can tell him so,but maybe another drugstore would she said,faulkner
27057,27058,then i dont want to know it,me that s then i looked at her,faulkner
27059,27060,but it s a hard life they have sometimes a man if there can ever be any excuse for sin which it cant be,and then life was nt made to be easy on folks they would nt ever have any reason to be good and die,faulkner
27061,27062,look here i said,you get that notion out of your head,faulkner
27063,27064,the lord gave you what you have even if he did use the devil to do it you let him take it away from you if it s his will to do so,you go on back to lafe and you and him take that ten dollars and get married with it,faulkner
27065,27066,lafe said i could get something at the drugstore she said,then go and get it i said,faulkner
27067,27068,you wont get it here,she went out carrying the package her feet making a little hissing on the floor,faulkner
27069,27070,she bumbled again at the door and went out,i could see her through the glass going on down the street,faulkner
27071,27072,it was albert told me about the rest of it he said the wagon was stopped in front of grummet s hardware store with the ladies all scattering up and down the street with handkerchiefs to their noses and a crowd of hardnosed men and boys standing around the wagon listening to the marshal arguing with the man,he was a kind of tall gaunted man sitting on the wagon saying it,faulkner
27073,27074,was a public street and he reckoned he had as much right there as anybody and the marshal telling him he would have to move on folks could nt stand it,it had been dead eight days albert said,faulkner
27075,27076,they came from some place out in yoknapatawpha county trying to get to jefferson with it,it must have been like a piece of rotten cheese coming into an anthill in that ramshackle wagon that albert said folks were scared would fall all to pieces before they could get it out of town with that homemade box and another fellow with a broken leg lying on a quilt on top of it and the father and a little boy sitting on the seat and the marshal trying to make them get outof town,faulkner
27077,27078,it s a public street the man says,reckon we can stop to buy something same as airy other man,faulkner
27079,27080,we got the money to pay for hit and hit aint airy law that says a man cant spend his money where he wants,they had stopped to buy some cement,faulkner
27081,27082,the other son was in grummet s trying to make grummet break a sack and let him have ten cents worth and finally grummet broke the sack to get him out,they wanted the cement to fix the fellow s broken leg someway,faulkner
27083,27084,why you ll kill him the marshal said,you ll cause him to lose his leg,faulkner
27085,27086,you take him on to a doctor and you get this thing buried soon as you can,dont you know you re liable to jail for endangering the public health,faulkner
27087,27088,we re doing the best we can the father said,then he told a long tale about how they had to wait for the wagon to come back and how the bridge was washed away and how they went eight miles to another bridge and it was gone too so they came back and swum the ford and the mules got drowned and how they got another team and found that the road was washed out and they had to come clean around by mottson and then the one with the cement came back and told him to shut up,faulkner
27089,27090,well be gone in a minute he told the marshal,we never aimed to bother nobody the father said,faulkner
27091,27092,you take that fellow to a doctor the marshal told the one with the cement,i reckon he s all right he said,faulkner
27093,27094,it aint that we re hardhearted the marshal said,but i reckon you can tell yourself how it is,faulkner
27095,27096,sho the other said,we ll take out soon as dewey dell comes back,faulkner
27097,27098,she went to deliver a package,so they stood there with the folks backed off with handkerchiefs to their faces until in a minute the girl came up with that newspaper package,faulkner
27099,27100,come on the one with the cement said we ve lost too much time,so they got in the wagon and went on,faulkner
27101,27102,and when i went to supper it still seemed like i could smell it,reckon they re in jefferson by now he said,faulkner
27103,27104,or in jail,well thank the lord it s not our jail,faulkner
27105,27106,that s a fact he said,he pulls the team up and sits looking at the house we could get some water over yonder,faulkner
27107,27108,all right i say,you ll have to borrow a bucket from them dewey dell,faulkner
27109,27110,god knows pa says,i would nt be beholden god knows,faulkner
27111,27112,if you see a goodsized can you might bring it i say,dewey dell gets down from the wagon carrying the package,faulkner
27113,27114,you had more trouble than you expected selling those cakes in mottson i say,how do our lives ravel out into the nowind nosound the weary gestures wearily recapitulant echoes of old compulsions with nohand on nostrings in sunset we fall into furious attitudes dead gestures of dolls,faulkner
27115,27116,cash broke his leg and now the sawdust is running out,god knows,faulkner
27117,27118,then make some water yourself i say,we can use cash s hat,faulkner
27119,27120,when dewey dell comes back the man comes with her,then he stops and she comes on and he stands there and after a while he goes back to the house and stands on the porch watching us,faulkner
27121,27122,we better not try to lift him down pa says,we can fix it here,faulkner
27123,27124,do you want to be lifted down cash,i say,faulkner
27125,27126,wont we get to jefferson tomorrow,he says,faulkner
27127,27128,he is watching us his eyes interrogatory intent and sad,i can last it out,faulkner
27129,27130,it ll be easier on you pa says,it ll keep it from rubbing together,faulkner
27131,27132,i can last it cash says,well lose time stopping,faulkner

27135,27136,it aint but one more day,it dont bother to speak of,faulkner
27137,27138,he looks at us his eyes wide in his thin gray face questioning,it sets up so he says,faulkner
27139,27140,we done bought it now pa says,i mix the cement in the can stirring the slow water into the pale green thick coils,faulkner
27141,27142,i bring the can to the wagon where cash can see,he lies on his back his thin profile in silhouette ascetic and profound against the sky,faulkner
27143,27144,does that look about right,i say,faulkner
27145,27146,you dont want too much water or it wont work right he says,is this too much,faulkner
27147,27148,maybe if you could get a little sand he says,it aint but one more day he says,faulkner
27149,27150,it dont bother me none,vardaman goes back down the road to where we crossed the branch and returns with sand,faulkner
27151,27152,he pours it slowly into the thick coiling in the can,i go to the wagon again,faulkner
27153,27154,does that look all right,yes cash says,faulkner
27155,27156,i could have lasted,it dont bother me none,faulkner
27157,27158,we loosen the splints and pour the cement over his leg slow,watch out for it cash says,faulkner
27159,27160,dont get none on it if you can help,yes i say,faulkner
27161,27162,dewey dell tears a piece of paper from the package and wipes the cement from the top of it as it drips from cash s leg,how does that feel,faulkner
27163,27164,it feels fine he says,it s cold,faulkner
27165,27166,i asks your forgiveness,i never foreseen it no more than you,faulkner

27169,27170,that would be nice,it would be nice if you could just ravel out into time,faulkner
27171,27172,we replace the splints the cords drawing them tight the cement in thick pale green slow surges among the cords cash watching us quietly with that profound questioning look,that ll steady it i say,faulkner
27173,27174,ay cash says,i m obliged,faulkner
27175,27176,then we all turn on the wagon and watch him,he is coming up the road behind us woodenbacked woodenfaced moving only from his hips down,faulkner

27195,27196,you can not watch them walking slow on the sun,in jefferson it is red on the track behind the glass,faulkner
27197,27198,the track goes shining round and round,dewey dell says so,faulkner
27199,27200,tonight i am going to see where they stay while we are in the barn,the breeze was setting up from the barn so we put her under the apple tree where the moonlight can dapple the apple tree upon the long slumbering flanks within which now and then she talks in little trickling bursts of secret and murmurous bubbling,faulkner
27201,27202,i took vardaman to listen,when we came up the cat leaped down from it and flicked away with silver claw and silver eye into the shadow,faulkner

27265,27266,let s go see about cash darl says,we fixed his leg this afternoon but he is sick in it again lying on the bed,faulkner
27267,27268,we pour water on his leg and then he feels fine,i feel fine cash says,faulkner
27269,27270,i m obliged to you,try to get some sleep we say,faulkner

27273,27274,and i saw something dewey dell told me not to tell nobody,we are not in the barn tonight but i can see the barn and so i am going to find where they stay at night,faulkner
27275,27276,we lie on the pallet with our legs in the moon,look i say my legs look black,faulkner
27277,27278,your legs look black too,go to sleep dewey dell says,faulkner
27279,27280,jefferson is a far piece,dewey dell,faulkner
27281,27282,it goes round and round on the shining track,then the track goes shining round and round,faulkner
27283,27284,will what be there,that train,faulkner
27285,27286,in the window,you go to sleep,faulkner
27287,27288,you can see tomorrow if it s there,maybe santa claus wont know they are town boys,faulkner
27289,27290,dewey dell,you go to sleep,faulkner
27291,27292,it made my heart hurt and then it was pa and jewel and darl and mr gillespie s boy,mr gillespie s boy s legs come down under his nightshirt when he goes into the moon his legs fuzz,faulkner
27293,27294,they go on around the house toward the apple tree,what are they going to do dewey dell,faulkner
27295,27296,they went around the house toward the apple tree,can smell her i say,faulkner
27297,27298,can you smell her too,hush dewey dell says,faulkner
27299,27300,the wind s changed,go to sleep,faulkner
27301,27302,and so i am going to know where they stay at night soon,they come around the house going across the yard in the moon carrying her on their shoulders,faulkner
27303,27304,they carry her down to the barn the moon shining flat and quiet on her,then they come back and go into the house again,faulkner
27305,27306,while they were in the moon mr gillespie s boy s legs fuzzed,and then i waited and i said dewey dell,faulkner
27307,27308,and then i waited and then i went to find where they stay at night and i saw something that dewey dell told me not to tell nobody,he leaps to the ground with on his face an expression of furious unbelief,faulkner
27309,27310,he has seen me without even turning his head or his eyes in which the glare swims like two small torches,come on he says leaping down the slope toward the barn,faulkner
27311,27312,for an instant longer he runs silver in the moonlight then he springs out like a flat figure cut leanly from tin against an abrupt and soundless explosion as the whole loft of the barn takes fire at once as though it had been stuffed with powder,the front the conical facade with the square orifice of doorway broken only by the square squat shape of the coffin on the sawhorses like a cubistic bug conies into relief,faulkner
27313,27314,behind me pa and gillespie and mack and dewey dell and vardaman emerge from the house,he pauses at the coffin stooping looking at me his face furious,faulkner
27315,27316,overhead the flames sound like thunder across us rushes a cool draft there is no heat in it at all yet and a handful of chaff lifts suddenly and sucks swiftly along the stalls where a horse is screaming,quick i say the horses,faulkner
27317,27318,he glares a moment longer at me then at the roof overhead then he leaps toward the stall where the horse screams,it plunges and kicks the sound of the crashing blows sucking up into the sound of the flames,faulkner
27319,27320,they sound like an interminable train crossing an endless trestle,gillespie and mack pass me in kneelength nightshirts shouting their voices thin and high and meaningless and at the same time profoundly wild and sad,faulkner
27321,27322,cow,stall,faulkner
27323,27324,gillespie s nightshirt rushes ahead of him on the draft ballooning about his hairy thighs,the stall door has swung shut,faulkner
27325,27326,jewel thrusts it back with his buttocks and he appears his back arched the muscles ridged through his garment as he drags the horse out by its head,in the glare its eyes roll with soft fleet wild opaline fire its muscles bunch and run as it flings its head about lifting jewel clear of the ground,faulkner
27327,27328,he drags it on slowly terrifically again he gives me across his shoulder a single glare furious and brief,even when they are clear of the barn the horse continues to fight and lash backward toward the doorway until gillespie passes me starknaked his nightshirt wrapped about the mule s head and beats the maddened horse on out of the door,faulkner
27329,27330,jewel returns running again he looks down at file coffin,but he comes on,faulkner
27331,27332,where s cow,he cries passing me,faulkner
27333,27334,i follow him,in the stall mack is struggling with the other mule,faulkner
27335,27336,when its head turns into the glare i can see the wild rolling of its eye too but it makes no sound,it just stands there watching mack over its shoulder swinging its hind quarters toward him whenever he approaches,faulkner
27337,27338,he looks back at us his eyes and mouth three round holes in his face on which the freckles look like english peas on a plate,his voice is thin high faraway,faulkner
27339,27340,i cant do nothing it is as though the sound had been swept from his lips and up and away speaking back to us from an immense distance of exhaustion,jewel slides past us the mule whirls and lashes out but he has already gained its head,faulkner
27341,27342,around his head,mack stares at me,faulkner
27343,27344,then he rips the nightshirt off and flings it over the mule s head and it becomes docile at once,jewel is yelling at him cow,faulkner
27345,27346,cow,back mack cries,faulkner
27347,27348,last stall,the cow watches us as we enter,faulkner
27349,27350,she is backed into the corner head lowered still chewing though rapidly,but she makes no move,faulkner
27351,27352,jewel has paused looking up and suddenly we watch the entire floor to the loft dissolve,it just turns to fire a faint litter of sparks rains down,faulkner
27353,27354,he glances about,back under the trough is a three legged milking stool,faulkner
27355,27356,he catches it up and swings it into the planking of the rear wall,he splinters a plank then another a third we tear the fragments away,faulkner
27357,27358,while we are stooping at the opening something charges into us from behind,it is the cow with a single whistling breath she rushes between us and through the gap and into the outer glare her tail erect and rigid as a broom nailed upright to the end of her spine,faulkner
27359,27360,jewel turns back into the barn,here i say jewel,faulkner
27361,27362,i grasp at him he strikes my hand down,you fool i say dont you see you cant make it hack yonder,faulkner
27363,27364,the hallway looks like a searchlight turned into rain,come on i say around this way,faulkner
27365,27366,when we are through the gap he begins to run,jewel i say running,faulkner
27367,27368,he darts around the corner,when i reach it he has almost reached the next one running against the glare like that figure cut from tin,faulkner
27369,27370,pa and gillespie and mack are some distance away watching the barn pink against the darkness where for the time the moonlight has been vanquished,catch him,faulkner
27371,27372,i cry stop him,when i reach the front he is struggling with gillespie the one lean in underclothes the other stark naked,faulkner
27373,27374,they are like two figures in a greek frieze isolated out of all reality by the red glare,before i can reach them he has struck gillespie to the ground and turned and run back into the barn,faulkner
27375,27376,the sound of it has become quite peaceful now like the sound of the river did,we watch through the dissolving proscenium of the doorway as jewel runs crouching to the far end of the coffin and stoops to it,faulkner
27377,27378,for an instant he looks up and out at us through the rain of burning hay like a portiere of flaming beads and i can see his mouth shape as he calls my name,jewel,faulkner
27379,27380,dewey dell cries jewel,it seems to me that i now hear the accumulation of her voice through the last five minutes and i hear her scuffling and struggling as pa and mack hold her screaming jewell jewel,faulkner
27381,27382,but he is no longer looking at us,we see his shoulders strain as he upends the coffin and slides it singlehanded from the sawhorses,faulkner
27383,27384,it looms unbelievably tall hiding him i would not have believed that addie bundren would have needed that much room to lie comfortable in for another instant it stands upright while the sparks rain on it in scattering bursts as though they engendered other sparks from the contact,then it topples forward gaining momentum revealing jewel and the sparks raining on him too in engendering gusts so that he appears to be enclosed in a thin nimbus of fire,faulkner
27385,27386,without stopping it overends and rears again pauses then crashes slowly forward and through the curtain,this time jewel is riding upon it clinging to it until it crashes down and flings him forward and clear and mack leaps forward into a thin smell of scorching meat and slaps at the widening crimsonedged holes that bloom like flowers in his undershirt,faulkner
27387,27388,where did darl go,they carried her back under the apple tree,faulkner
27389,27390,the barn was still red but it was nt a barn now,it was sunk down and the red went swirling up,faulkner
27391,27392,the barn went swirling up in little red pieces against the sky and the stars so that the stars moved backward,and then cash was still awake,faulkner
27393,27394,he turned his head from side to side with sweat on his face,do you want some more water on it cash,faulkner
27395,27396,dewey dell said,cash s leg and foot turned black,faulkner
27397,27398,we held the lamp and looked at cash s foot and leg where it was black,your foot looks like a nigger s foot cash i said,faulkner
27399,27400,i reckon well have to bust it off pa said,what in the tarnation you put it on there for mr gillespie said,faulkner
27401,27402,i thought it would steady it some pa said,i just aimed to help him,faulkner
27403,27404,they got the flat iron and the hammer,dewey dell held the lamp,faulkner
27405,27406,they had to hit it hard,and then cash went to sleep,faulkner
27407,27408,he s asleep now i said,it cant hurt him while he s asleep,faulkner
27409,27410,it just cracked,it would nt come off,faulkner
27411,27412,it ll take the hide too mr gillespie said,why in the tarnation you put it on there,faulkner
27413,27414,did nt none of you think to grease his leg first,i just aimed to help him pa said,faulkner
27415,27416,it was darl put it on,where is darl,faulkner
27417,27418,they said,did nt none of you have more sense than that,faulkner
27419,27420,mr gillespie said,i d a thought he would anyway,faulkner
27421,27422,jewel was lying on his face,his back was red,faulkner
27423,27424,dewey dell put the medicine on it,the medicine was made out of butter and soot to draw out the fire,faulkner
27425,27426,then his back was black,does it hurt jewel,faulkner
27427,27428,i said,your back looks like a nigger s jewel i said,faulkner
27429,27430,cash s foot and leg looked like a nigger s,then they broke it off,faulkner
27431,27432,cash s leg bled,you go on back and lay down dewey dell said,faulkner
27433,27434,you ought to be asleep,where is darl,faulkner
27435,27436,they said,he is out there under the apple tree with her lying on her,faulkner
27437,27438,he is there so the cat wont come back,i said are you going to keep the cat away darl,faulkner
27439,27440,the moonlight dappled on him too,on her it was still but on darl it dappled up and down,faulkner
27441,27442,you need nt to cry i said,jewel got her out,faulkner
27443,27444,you need nt to cry darl,the barn is still red,faulkner
27445,27446,it used to be redder than this,then it went swirling making the stars run backward without falling,faulkner
27447,27448,it hurt my heart like the train did,mi,faulkner
27449,27450,from the crest of a hill as we get into the wagon again we can see the somke low and flat seemingly unmoving in the unwinded afternoon,is that darl,faulkner
27451,27452,vardaman says,is that jefferson,faulkner
27453,27454,he too has lost flesh like ours his face has an expression strained dreamy and gaunt,yes i say,faulkner
27455,27456,he lifts his head and looks at the sky,high against it they hand in narrowing circles like the smoke with an outward semblance of from and purpose but with no inference of motion progress or retrograde we mount the wagon again where cash lies on the box the jagged shards of cement cracked about his leg,faulkner
27457,27458,the shabby mules droop rattling and clanking down the hill,we ll have to take him to the doctor pa says,faulkner
27459,27460,i reckon it aint no way around it,the back of jewel s shirt where it touches him stains slow and black with grease,faulkner
27461,27462,life was created in the valleys,it blew up onto the hills on the old terrors the old lusts the old despairs,faulkner
27463,27464,that s why you must walk up the hills so you can ride down,dewey dell sits on the seat the newspaper package on her lap,faulkner
27465,27466,when we reach the foot of the hill where the road flattens between close walls of trees she begins to look about quietly from one side of the road to the other,at last she says i got to stop,faulkner
27467,27468,pa looks at her his shabby profile that of anticipant and disgruntled annoyance,he does not check the team,faulkner
27469,27470,what for,i got to go to the bushes dewey dell says,faulkner
27471,27472,pa does not check the team,cant you wait till we get to town,faulkner
27473,27474,it aint over a mile now,stop dewey dell says,faulkner
27475,27476,i got to go to the bushes,pa stops in the middle of the road and we watch dewey dell descend carrying the package,faulkner
27477,27478,she does not look back,why not leave your cakes here,faulkner
27479,27480,i say,well watch them,faulkner
27481,27482,she descends steadily not looking at us,how would she know where to go if she waited till we get to town,faulkner
27483,27484,vardaman says,where would you go to do it in town dewey dell,faulkner
27485,27486,she lifts the package down and turns and disappears among the trees and undergrowth,dont be no longer than you can help pa says,faulkner
27487,27488,we aint got no time to waste,she does not answer,faulkner
27489,27490,after a while we can not hear her even,we ought to done like armstid and gillespie said and sent word to town and had it dug and ready he said,faulkner
27491,27492,why did nt you,i say,faulkner
27493,27494,you could have telephoned,what for,faulkner
27495,27496,jewel says,who the hell cant dig a hole in the ground,faulkner
27497,27498,a car comes over the hill,it begins to sound the torn slowing,faulkner
27499,27500,it runs along the roadside in low gear the outside wheels in the ditch and passes us and goes on,vardaman watches it until it is out of sight,faulkner
27501,27502,how far is it now darl,he says,faulkner
27503,27504,not far i say,we ought to done it pa says,faulkner
27505,27506,i just never wanted to be beholden to none except her flesh and blood,who the hell cant dig a damn hole in the ground,faulkner
27507,27508,jewel says,it aint respectful talking that way about her grave pa says,faulkner
27509,27510,you all dont know what it is,you never pure loved her none of you,faulkner
27511,27512,jewel does not answer,he sits a little stiffly erect his body arched away from his shirt,faulkner
27513,27514,his highcolored jaw juts,dewey dell returns,faulkner
27515,27516,we watch her emerge from the bushes carrying the package and climb into the wagon,she now wears her sunday dress her beads her shoes and stockings,faulkner
27517,27518,i thought i told you to leave them clothes to home pa says,she does not answer does not look at us,faulkner
27519,27520,she sets the package in the wagon and gets in,the wagon moves on,faulkner
27521,27522,how many more hills now darl,vardaman says,faulkner
27523,27524,just one i say,the next one goes right up into town,faulkner
27525,27526,this hill is red sand bordered on either hand by negro cabins against the sky ahead the massed telephone lines run and the clock on the courthouse lifts among the trees,in the sand the wheels whisper as though the very earth would hush our entry,faulkner
27527,27528,we descend as the hill commences to rise,we follow the wagon the whispering wheels passing the cabins where faces come suddenly to the doors whiteeyed,faulkner
27529,27530,we hear sudden voices ejaculant,jewel has been looking from side to side now his head turns forward and i can see his ears taking on a still deeper tone of furious red,faulkner
27531,27532,three negroes walk beside the road ahead of us ten feet ahead of them a white man walks,when we pass the negroes their heads turn suddenly with that expression of shock and instinctive outrage,faulkner
27533,27534,great god one says what they got in that wagon,jewel whirls,faulkner
27535,27536,son of a bitches he says,as he does so he is abreast of the white man who has paused,faulkner
27537,27538,it is as though jewel had gone blind for the moment for it is the white man toward whom he whirls,darl,faulkner
27539,27540,cash says from the wagon,i grasp at jewel,faulkner
27541,27542,the white man has fallen back a pace his face still slackjawed then his jaw tightens claps to,jewel leans above him his jaw muscles gone white,faulkner
27543,27544,what did you say,he says,faulkner
27545,27546,here i say,he dont mean anything mister,faulkner
27547,27548,jewel i say,when i touch him he swings at the man,faulkner
27549,27550,i grasp his arm we struggle,jewel has never looked at me,faulkner
27551,27552,he is trying to free his arm,when i see the man again he has an open knife in his hand,faulkner
27553,27554,hold up mister i say i ve got him,jewel i say,faulkner
27555,27556,thinks because he s a goddamn town fellow jewel says panting wrenching at me,son of a bitch he says,faulkner
27557,27558,the man moves,he begins to edge around me watching jewel the knife low against his flank,faulkner
27559,27560,cant no man call me that he says,pa has got down and dewey dell is holding jewel pushing at him,faulkner
27561,27562,i release him and face the man,wait i say,faulkner
27563,27564,he dont mean nothing,he s sick got burned in a fire last night and he aint himself,faulkner
27565,27566,fire or no fire the man says cant no man call me that,he thought you said something to him i say,faulkner
27567,27568,i never said nothing to him,i never see him before,faulkner
27569,27570,fore god pa says fore god,i know i say,faulkner
27571,27572,he never meant anything,he ll take it back,faulkner
27573,27574,let him take it back then,put up your knife and he will,faulkner
27575,27576,the man looks at me,he looks at jewel,faulkner
27577,27578,jewel is quiet now,put up your knife i say,faulkner
27579,27580,the man shuts the knife,fore god pa says,faulkner
27581,27582,fore god,tell him you did nt mean anything jewel i say,faulkner
27583,27584,i thought he said something jewel says,tell him you did nt mean it,faulkner
27585,27586,i did nt mean it jewel says,he better not the man says,faulkner
27587,27588,calling me a do you think he s afraid to call you that,i say,faulkner
27589,27590,the man looks at me,i never said that he said,faulkner
27591,27592,dont think it neither jewel says,shut up i say,faulkner
27593,27594,come on,the man stands watching us,faulkner
27595,27596,jewel does not look back,jewel would a whipped him vardaman says,faulkner
27597,27598,we approach the crest where the street runs where cars go back and forth the mules haul the wagon up and onto the crest and the street,pa stops them,faulkner
27599,27600,the street runs on ahead where the square opens and the monument stands before the courthouse,we mount again while the heads turn with that expression which we know save jewel,faulkner
27601,27602,he does not get on even though the wagon has started again,get in jewel i say,faulkner
27603,27604,come on,let s get away from here,faulkner
27605,27606,but he does not get in,instead he sets his foot on the turning hub of the rear wheel one hand grasping the stanchion and with the hub turning smoothly under his sole he lifts the other foot and squats there staring straight ahead motionless lean woodenbacked as though carved squatting out of the lean wood,faulkner
27607,27608,it was either send him to jackson or have gillespie sue us because he knowed some way that darl set fire to it,i dont know how he knowed but he did,faulkner
27609,27610,vardaman see him do it but he swore he never told nobody but dewey dell and that she told him not to tell nobody,but gillespie knowed it,faulkner
27611,27612,but he would a suspicioned it sooner or later,he could have done it that night just watching the way darl acted,faulkner
27613,27614,fix him,pa said,faulkner
27615,27616,catch him and tie him up jewel said,goddamn it do you want to wait until he sets fire to the goddamn team and wagon,faulkner
27617,27618,but there was nt no use in that,there aint no use in that i said,faulkner
27619,27620,we can wait till she is underground,a fellow that s going to spend the rest of his life locked up he ought to be let to have what pleasure he can have before he goes,faulkner
27621,27622,i reckon he ought to be there pa says,god knows it s a trial on me,faulkner
27623,27624,seems like it aint no end to bad luck when once it starts,sometimes i aint so sho who s got ere a right to say when a man is crazy and when he aint,faulkner
27625,27626,sometimes i think it aint none of us pure crazy and aint none of us pure sane until the balance of us talks him thataway,it s like it aint so much what a fellow does but it s the way the majority of folks is looking at him when he does it,faulkner
27627,27628,because jewel is too hard on him,of course it was jewel s horse was traded to get her that nigh to town and in a sense it was the value of his horse darl tried to burn up,faulkner
27629,27630,but i thought more than once before we crossed the river and after how it would be god s blessing if he did take her outen our hands and get shut of her in some clean way and it seemed to me that when jewel worked so to get her outen the river he was going against god in a way and then when darl seen that it looked like one of us would have to do something i can almost believe he done right in a way,but i dont reckon nothing excuses setting fire to a man s barn and endangering his stock and destroying his property,faulkner
27631,27632,that s how i reckon a man is crazy,that s how he cant see eye to eye with other folks,faulkner
27633,27634,and i reckon they aint nothing else to do with him but what the most folks says is right,but it s a shame in a way,faulkner
27635,27636,folks seems to get away from the olden right teaching that says to drive the nails down and trim the edges well always like it was for your own use and comfort you were making it,it s like some folks has the smooth pretty boards to build a courthouse with and others dont have no more than rough lumber fitten to build a chicken coop,faulkner
27637,27638,but it s better to build a tight chicken coop than a shoddy courthouse and when they both build shoddy or build well neither because it s one or toothier is going to make a man feel the better nor the worse,so we went up the street toward the square and he said we better take cash to the doctor first,faulkner
27639,27640,we can leave him there and come back for him,that s it,faulkner
27641,27642,it s because me and him was born close together and it nigh ten years before jewel and dewey dell and vardaman begun to come along,i feel kin to them all right but i dont know,faulkner
27643,27644,and me being the oldest and thinking already the very thing that he done i dont know,pa was looking at me then at him mumbling his mouth,faulkner
27645,27646,go on i said,well get it done first,faulkner
27647,27648,she would want us all there pa says,let s take cash to the doctor first darl said,faulkner
27649,27650,she ll wait,she s already waited nine days,faulkner

27675,27676,so darl set still and we went on with jewel squatting on the tailgate watching the back of darl s head,he looked like one of these bull dogs one of these dogs that dont bark none squatting against the rope watching the thing he was waiting to jump at,faulkner
27677,27678,he set that way all the time we was in front of mrs bundren s house hearing the music watching the back of darl s head with them hard white eyes of hisn,the music was playing in the house,faulkner
27679,27680,it was one of them graphophones,it was natural as a musicband,faulkner

27687,27688,maybe they got one here he said,he pulled up at mrs bundren s,faulkner
27689,27690,it was like he knowed,sometimes i think that if a working man could see work as far ahead as a lazy man can see laziness,faulkner
27691,27692,so he stopped there like he knowed before that little new house where the music was,we waited there hearing it,faulkner
27693,27694,i believe i could have dickered suratt down to five dollars on that one of his,it s a comfortable thing music is,faulkner

27703,27704,only it was more than ten minutes,the music stopped and never commenced again for a good spell where her and pa was talking at the back,faulkner
27705,27706,we waited in the wagon,you let me take you back to peabody s darl said,faulkner
27707,27708,no i said,we ll get her underground,faulkner
27709,27710,if he ever gets back jewel said,he begun to cuss,faulkner

27715,27716,the music never started again,pa was looking back at the house,faulkner
27717,27718,he kind of lifted his hand a little and i saw the shade pulled back a little at the window and her face in it,but the curiousest thing was dewey dell,faulkner
27719,27720,it surprised me,i see all the while how folks could say he was queer but that was the very reason could nt nobody hold it personal,faulkner
27721,27722,it was like he was outside of it too same as you and getting mad at it would be kind of like getting mad at a mudpuddle that splashed you when you stepped in it,and then i always kind of had a idea that him and dewey dell kind of knowed things betwixt them,faulkner
27723,27724,if i d a said it was ere a one of us she liked better than ere a other i d a said it was darl,but when we got it filled and covered and drove out the gate and turned into the lane where them fellows was waiting when they come out and come on him and he jerked back it was dewey dell that was on him before even jewel could get at him,faulkner
27725,27726,and then i believed i knowed how gillespie knowed about how his barn taken fire,she had nt said a word had nt even looked at him but when them fellows told him what they wanted and that they had come to get him and he throwed back she jumped on him like a wild cat so that one of the fellows had to quit and hold her and her scratching and clawing at him like a wild cat while the other one and pa and jewel throwed darl down and held him lying on his back looking up at me,faulkner
27727,27728,i thought you would have told me he said,i never thought you would nt have,faulkner
27729,27730,darl i said,kill the son of a bitch,faulkner

27735,27736,i tried to tell him but he just said i thought you d a told me,it s not that i he said then he begun to laugh,faulkner
27737,27738,the other fellow pulled jewel off of him and he sat there on the ground laughing,i tried to tell him,faulkner
27739,27740,if i could have just moved even set up,but i tried to tell him and he quit laughing looking up at me,faulkner
27741,27742,do you want me to go,he said,faulkner

27749,27750,he could nt hardly say it for laughing,he sat on the ground and us watching him laughing and laughing,faulkner
27751,27752,it was bad,it was bad so,faulkner
27753,27754,i be durn if i could see anything to laugh at,because there just aint nothing justifies the deliberate destruction of what a man has built with his own sweat and stored the fruit of his sweat into,faulkner
27755,27756,but i aint so sho that ere a man has the right to say what is crazy and what aint,they just aimed to ease hit some he said,faulkner

27765,27766,you mean it never bothered anse much i said,no more than it bothered him to throw that poor devil down in the public street and handcuff him like a damn murderer,faulkner
27767,27768,dont tell me,and dont tell me it aint going to bother you to lose sixtyodd square inches of skin to get that concrete off,faulkner
27769,27770,and dont tell me it aint going to bother you to have to limp around on one short leg for the balance of your life if you walk at all again,concrete i said,faulkner
27771,27772,god amighty why did nt anse carry you to the nearest sawmill and stick your leg in the saw,that would have cured it,faulkner

27969,27970,so i took a graduated glass and kind of turned my back to her and picked out a bottle that looked all right because a man that would keep poison setting around in a unlabelled bottle ought to be in jail anyway,it smelled like turpentine,faulkner
27971,27972,i poured some into the glass and give it to her,she smelled it looking at me across the glass,faulkner

27999,28000,i went as far as the corner with him and watched him until he passed under two street lamps and went on out of sight,then i come back to the store and waited until ninethirty and turned out the front lights and locked the door and left just one light burning at the back and i went back and put some talcum powder into six capsules and land of cleared up the cellar and then i was all ready,faulkner

31245,31246,you can be oblivious to the sound for a long while then in a second of ticking it can create in the mind unbroken the long diminishing parade of time you did nt hear,like father said down the long and lonely lightrays you might see jesus walking like,faulkner
31247,31248,and the good saint francis that said little sister death that never had a sister,through the wall i heard shreve s bedsprings and then his slippers on the floor hishing,faulkner
31249,31250,i got up and went to the dresser and slid my hand along it and touched the watch and turned it facedown and went back to bed,but the shadow of the sash was still there and i had learned to tell almost to the minute so i d have to turn my back to it feeling the eyes animals used to have in the back of their heads when it was on top itching,faulkner
31251,31252,it s always the idle habits you acquire which you will regret,father said that,faulkner
31253,31254,that christ was not crucified he was worn away by a minute clicking of little wheels,that had no sister,faulkner
31255,31256,and so as soon as i knew i could nt see it i began to wonder what time it was,father said that constant speculation regarding the position of mechanical hands on an arbitrary dial which is a symptom of mindfunction,faulkner
31257,31258,excrement father said like sweating,and i saying all right,faulkner
31259,31260,wonder,go on and wonder,faulkner
31261,31262,if it had been cloudy i could have looked at the window thinking what he said about idle habits,thinking it would be nice for them down at new london if the weather held up like this,faulkner
31263,31264,why should nt it,the month of brides the voice that breathed she ran right out of the mirror out of the banked scent,faulkner

31273,31274,if you attend harvard one year but dont see the boatrace there should be a refund,let jason have it,faulkner
31275,31276,give jason a year at harvard,shreve stood in the door putting his collar on his glasses glinting rosily as though he had washed them with his face,faulkner
31277,31278,you taking a cut this morning,is it that late,faulkner
31279,31280,he looked at his watch,bell in two minutes,faulkner
31281,31282,i did nt know it was that late,he was still looking at the watch his mouth shaping,faulkner
31283,31284,i ll have to hustle,i cant stand another cut,faulkner
31285,31286,the dean told me last week he put the watch back into his pocket,then i quit talking,faulkner
31287,31288,you d better slip on your pants and run he said,he went out,faulkner
31289,31290,i got up and moved about listening to him through the wall,he entered the sittingroom toward the door,faulkner
31291,31292,are nt you ready yet,not yet,faulkner
31293,31294,run along,i ll make it,faulkner
31295,31296,he went out,the door closed,faulkner
31297,31298,his feet went down the corridor,then i could hear the watch again,faulkner
31299,31300,i quit moving around and went to the window and drew the curtains aside and watched them running for chapel the same ones fighting the same heaving coatsleeves the same books and flapping collars flushing past like debris on a flood and spoade,calling shreve my husband,faulkner
31301,31302,ah let him alone shreve said if he s got better sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts whose business,in the south you are ashamed of being a virgin,faulkner
31303,31304,boys,men,faulkner
31305,31306,they lie about it,because it means less to women father said,faulkner
31307,31308,he said it was men invented virginity not women,father said it s like death only a state in which the others are left and i said but to believe it does nt matter and he said that s what s so sad about anything not only virginity and i said why could nt it have been me and not her who is unvirgin and he said that s why that s sad too nothing is even worth the changing of it and shreve said if he s got better sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts and i said did you ever have a sister,faulkner
31309,31310,did you,did you,faulkner
31311,31312,spoade was in the middle of them like a terrapin in a street full of scuttering dead leaves his collar about his ears moving at his customary unhurried walk,he was from south carolina a senior,faulkner
31313,31314,it was his club s boast that he never ran for chapel and had never got there on time and had never been absent in four years and had never made either chapel or first lecture with a shirt on his back and socks on his feet,about ten oclock he d come in thompson s get two cups of coffee sit down and take his socks out of his pocket and remove his shoes and put them on while the coffee cooled,faulkner
31315,31316,about noon you d see him with a shirt and collar on like anybody else,the others passed him running but he never increased his pace at all,faulkner
31317,31318,after a while the quad was empty,a sparrow slanted across the sunlight onto the window ledge and cocked his head at me,faulkner
31319,31320,his eye was round and bright,first he d watch me with one eye then flick,faulkner
31321,31322,and it would be the other one his throat pumping faster than any pulse,the hour began to strike,faulkner
31323,31324,the sparrow quit swapping eyes and watched me steadily with the same one until the chimes ceased as if he were listening too,then he flicked off the ledge and was gone,faulkner
31325,31326,it was a while before the last stroke ceased vibrating,it stayed in the air more felt than heard for a long time,faulkner
31327,31328,like all the bells that ever rang still ringing in the long dying lightrays and jesus and saint francis talking about his sister,because if it were just to hell if that were all of it,faulkner
31329,31330,finished,if things just finished themselves,faulkner
31331,31332,nobody else there but her and me,if we could just have done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us,faulkner
31333,31334,i have committed incest i said father it was i it was not dalton ames and when he put dalton ames,dalton ames,faulkner
31335,31336,dalton ames,when he put the pistol in my hand i did nt,faulkner
31337,31338,that s why i did nt,he would be there and she would and i would,faulkner
31339,31340,dalton ames,dalton ames,faulkner
31341,31342,dalton ames,if we could have just done something so dreadful and father said that s sad too people can not do anything that dreadful they can not do anything very dreadful at all they can not even remember tomorrow what seemed dreadful today and i said you can shirk all things and he said ah can you,faulkner
31343,31344,and i will look down and see my murmuring bones and the deep water like wind like a roof of wind and after a long time they can not distinguish even bones upon the lonely and inviolate sand,until on the day when he says rise only the flatiron would come floating up,faulkner
31345,31346,it s not when you realise that nothing can help you religion pride anything it s when you realise that you dont need any aid,dalton ames,faulkner
31347,31348,dalton ames,dalton ames,faulkner
31349,31350,if i could have been his mother lying with open body lifted laughing holding his father with my hand refraining seeing watching him die before he lived,i tapped the crystal on the corner of the dresser and caught the fragments of glass in my hand and put them into the ashtray and twisted the hands off and put them in the tray,faulkner
31351,31352,the watch ticked on,i turned the face up the blank dial with little wheels clicking and click ing behind it not knowing any better,faulkner
31353,31354,jesus walking on galilee and washington not telling lies,father brought back a watchcharm from the saint louis fair to jason a tiny opera glass into which you squinted with one eye and saw a skyscraper a ferris wheel all spidery niagara falls on a pinhead,faulkner
31355,31356,there was a red smear on the dial,when i saw it my thumb began to smart,faulkner
31357,31358,i put the watch down and went into shreve s room and got the iodine and painted the cut,i cleaned the rest of the glass out of the rim with a towel,faulkner
31359,31360,i laid out two suits of underwear with socks shirts collars and ties and packed my trunk,i put in everything except my new suit and an old one and two pairs of shoes and two hats and my books,faulkner
31361,31362,i carried the books into the sittingroom and stacked them on the table the ones i had brought from home and the ones father said it used to be a gentleman was known by his books nowadays he is known by the ones he has not returned and locked the trunk and addressed it,the quarter hour sounded,faulkner
31363,31364,i stopped and listened to it until the chimes ceased,i bathed and shaved,faulkner
31365,31366,the water made my finger smart a little so i painted it again,i put on my new suit and put my watch on and packed the other suit and the accessories and my razor and brushes in my hand bag and folded the trunk key into a sheet of paper and put it in an envelope and addressed it to father and wrote the two notes and sealed them,faulkner
31367,31368,the shadow had nt quite cleared the stoop,i stopped inside the door watching the shadow move,faulkner
31369,31370,it moved almost perceptibly creeping back inside the door driving the shadow back into the door,only she was running already when i heard it,faulkner
31371,31372,in the mirror she was running before i knew what it was,that quick her train caught up over her arm she ran out of the mirror like a cloud her veil swirling in long glints her heels brittle and fast clutch ing her dress onto her shoulder with the other hand run ning out of the mirror the smells roses roses the voice that breathed oer eden,faulkner
31373,31374,then she was across the porch i could nt hear her heels then in the moonlight like a cloud the floating shadow of the veil running across the grass into the bellowing,she ran out of her dress clutching her bridal running into the bellowing where t p in the dew whooey sassprilluh benjy under the box bellowing,faulkner
31375,31376,i could nt make it i said,not with all that primping,faulkner
31377,31378,what s the matter,you think this was sunday,faulkner
31379,31380,i reckon the police wont get me for wearing my new suit one time i said,i was thinking about the square students,faulkner
31381,31382,they ll think you go to harvard,have you got too proud to at tend classes too,faulkner
31383,31384,i m going to eat first,the shadow on the stoop was gone,faulkner
31385,31386,i stepped into sunlight finding my shadow again,i walked down the steps just ahead of it,faulkner
31387,31388,the half hour went,then the chimes ceased and died away,faulkner
31389,31390,deacon was nt at the postoffice either,i stamped the two envelopes and mailed the one to father and put shreve s in my inside pocket and then i remembered where i had last seen the deacon,faulkner
31391,31392,it was on decoration day in a gar,uniform in the middle of the parade,faulkner
31393,31394,if you waited long enough on any corner you would see him in whatever parade came along,the one before was on columbus or garibaldi s or somebody s birthday,faulkner
31395,31396,he was in the street sweepers section in a stovepipe hat carrying a two inch italian flag smoking a cigar among the brooms and scoops,but the last time was the gar,faulkner
31397,31398,just look at what your grandpa did to that poor old nigger,yes i said,faulkner
31399,31400,now he can spend day after day marching in parades,if it had nt been for my grandfather he d have to work like whitefolks,faulkner
31401,31402,i did nt see him anywhere,but i never knew even a working nigger that you could find when you wanted him let alone one that lived off the fat of the land,faulkner
31403,31404,a car came along,i went over to town and went to parker s and had a good breakfast,faulkner
31405,31406,while i was eating i heard a clock strike the hour,but then i suppose it takes at least one hour to lose time in who has been longer than history getting into the mechanical progression of it,faulkner
31407,31408,when i finished breakfast i bought a cigar,the girl said a fifty cent one was the best so i took one and lit it and went out to the street,faulkner
31409,31410,i stood there and took a couple of puffs then i held it in my hand and went on toward the corner,i passed a jeweller s window but i looked away in time,faulkner
31411,31412,at the corner two bootblacks caught me one on either side shrill and raucous like blackbirds,i gave the cigar to one of them and the other one a nickel,faulkner
31413,31414,then they let me alone,the one with the cigar was trying to sell it to the other for the nickel,faulkner
31415,31416,there was a clock high up in the sun and i thought about how when you dont want to do a thing your body will try to trick you into doing it sort of unawares,i could feel the muscles in the back of my neck and then i could hear my watch ticking away in my pocket and after a while i had all the other sounds shut away leaving only the watch in my pocket,faulkner
31417,31418,i turned back up the street to the window,he was working at the table behind the window,faulkner
31419,31420,he was going bald,there was a glass in his eye a metal tube screwed into his face,faulkner
31421,31422,i went in,the place was full of ticking like crickets in september grass and i could hear a big clock on the wall above his head,faulkner
31423,31424,he looked up his eye big and blurred and rushing beyond the glass,i took mine out and handed it to him,faulkner
31425,31426,i broke my watch,he flipped it over in his hand,faulkner
31427,31428,i should say you have,you must have stepped on it,faulkner
31429,31430,yes sir,i knocked it off the dresser and stepped on it in the dark,faulkner
31431,31432,it s still running though,he pried the back open and squinted into it,faulkner
31433,31434,seems to be all right,i cant tell until i go over it though,faulkner
31435,31436,i ll go into it this afternoon,i ll bring it back later i said,faulkner
31437,31438,would you mind telling me if any of those watches in the window are right,he held my watch on his palm and looked up at me with his blurred rushing eye,faulkner
31439,31440,i made a bet with a fellow i said,and i forgot my glasses this morning,faulkner
31441,31442,why all right he said,he laid the watch down and half rose on his stool and looked over the barrier,faulkner
31443,31444,then he glanced up at the wall,just tell me if any of them are right,faulkner
31445,31446,he looked at me again,he sat back on the stool and pushed the glass up onto his forehead,faulkner
31447,31448,it left a red circle around his eye and when it was gone his whole face looked naked,what re you celebrating today,faulkner
31449,31450,he said,that boat race aint until next week is it,faulkner
31451,31452,no sir,this is just a private celebration,faulkner
31453,31454,birthday,are any of them right,faulkner
31455,31456,no,but they have nt been regulated and set yet,faulkner
31457,31458,i dont need a watch,we have a clock in our sitting room,faulkner
31459,31460,i ll have this one fixed when i do,i reached my hand,faulkner
31461,31462,better leave it now,i ll bring it back later,faulkner
31463,31464,he gave me the watch,i put it in my pocket,faulkner
31465,31466,i could nt hear it now above all the others,i m much obliged to you,faulkner
31467,31468,i hope i have nt taken up your time,that s all right,faulkner
31469,31470,bring it in when you are ready,and you better put off this celebration until after we win that boat race,faulkner
31471,31472,yes sir,i reckon i had,faulkner
31473,31474,i went out shutting the door upon the ticking,i looked back into the window,faulkner
31475,31476,he was watching me across the barrier,there were about a dozen watches in the window a dozen different hours and each with the same assertive and contradictory assurance that mine had without any hands at all,faulkner
31477,31478,contradicting one another,i could hear mine ticking away inside my pocket even though nobody could see it even though it could tell nothing if anyone could,faulkner
31479,31480,and so i told myself to take that one,because father said clocks slay time,faulkner
31481,31482,he said time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels only when the clock stops does time come to life,the hands were extended slightly off the horizontal at a faint angle like a gull tilting into the wind,faulkner
31483,31484,holding all i used to be sorry about like the new moon holding water niggers say,the jeweller was working again bent over his bench the tube tunnelled into his face,faulkner
31485,31486,his hair was parted in the center,the part ran up into the bald spot like a drained marsh in december,faulkner
31487,31488,i saw the hardware store from across the street,i did nt know you bought flatirons by the pound,faulkner
31489,31490,maybe you want a tailor s goose the clerk said,they weigh ten pounds,faulkner
31491,31492,only they were bigger than i thought,so i got two sixpound little ones because they would look like a pair of shoes wrapped up,faulkner
31493,31494,they felt heavy enough together but i thought again how father had said about the reducto absurdum of human experience thinking how the only opportunity i seemed to have for the application of harvard,maybe by next year thinking maybe it takes two years in school to learn to do that properly,faulkner
31495,31496,but they felt heavy enough in the air,a car came,faulkner
31497,31498,i got on,i did nt see the placard on the front,faulkner
31499,31500,it was full mostly prosperous looking people reading newspapers,the only vacant seat was beside a nigger,faulkner
31501,31502,he wore a derby and shined shoes and he was holding a dead cigar stub,i used to think that a southerner had to be always conscious of niggers,faulkner
31503,31504,i thought that northerners would expect him to,when i first came east i kept thinking you ve got to remember to think of them as colored people not niggers and if it had nt happened that i was nt thrown with many of them i d have wasted a lot of time and trouble before i learned that the best way to take all people black or white is to take them for what they think they are then leave them alone,faulkner
31505,31506,that was when i realisedthat a digger is not a person so much as a form of behavior a sort of obverse reflection of the white people he lives among,but i thought at first that i ought to miss having a lot of them around me because i thought that northerners thought i did but i did nt know that i really had missed roskus and dilsey and them until that morning in virginia,faulkner
31507,31508,the train was stopped when i waked and i raised the shade and looked out,the car was blocking a road crossing where two white fences came down a hill and then sprayed outward and downward like part of the skeleton of a horn and there was a nigger on a mule in the middle of the stiff ruts waiting for the train to move,faulkner
31509,31510,how long he had been there i did nt know but he sat straddle of the mule his head wrapped in a piece of blanket as if they had been built there with the fence and the road or with the hill carved out of the hill itself like a sign put there saying you are home again,he did nt have a saddle and his feet dangled almost to the ground,faulkner
31511,31512,the mule looked like a rabbit,i raised the window,faulkner
31513,31514,hey uncle i said,is this the way,faulkner
31515,31516,suh,he looked at me then he loosened the blanket and lifted it away from his ear,faulkner
31517,31518,christmas gift,i said,faulkner
31519,31520,sho comin boss,you done caught me aint you,faulkner
31521,31522,i ll let you off this time,i dragged my pants out of the little hammock and got a quarter out,faulkner
31523,31524,but look out next time,i ll be coming back through here two days after new year and look out then,faulkner
31525,31526,i threw the quarter out the window,buy yourself some santy claus,faulkner
31527,31528,yes suh he said,he got down and picked up the quarter and rubbed it on his leg,faulkner
31529,31530,thanky young marster,thanky,faulkner
31531,31532,then the train began to move,i leaned out the window into the cold air looking back,faulkner
31533,31534,he stood there beside the gaunt rabbit of a mule the two of them shabby and motionless and unimpatient,the train swung around the curve the engine puffing with short heavy blasts and they passed smoothly from sight that way with that quality about them of shabby and timeless patience of static serenity that blending of childlike and ready incompetence and paradoxical reliability that tends and protects them it loves out of all reason and robs them steadily and evades responsibility and obligations by means too barefaced to be called subterfuge even and is taken in theft or evasion with only that frank and spontaneous admiration for the victor which a gentleman feels for anyone who beats him in a fair contest and withal a fond and unflagging tolerance for whitefolks vagaries like that of a grandparent for unpredictable and troublesome children which i had forgotten,faulkner
31535,31536,and all that day while the train wound through rushing gaps and along ledges where movement was only a laboring sound of the exhaust and groaning wheels and the eternal mountains stood fading into the thick sky i thought of home of the bleak station and the mud and the niggers and country folks thronging slowly about the square with toy monkeys and wagons and candy in sacks and roman candles sticking out and my insides would move like they used to do in school when the bell rang,i would nt begin counting until the clock struck three,faulkner
31537,31538,then i would begin counting to sixty and folding down one finger and thinking of the other fourteen fingers waiting to be folded down or thirteen or twelve or eight or seven until all of a sudden i d realise silence and the unwinking minds and i d say maam,your name is quentin is nt it,faulkner
31539,31540,miss laura would say,then more silence and the cruel unwinking minds and hands jerking into the silence,faulkner
31541,31542,tell quentin who discovered the mississippi river henry,desoto,faulkner
31543,31544,then the minds would go away and after a while i d be afraid i had gotten behind and i d count fast and fold down another finger then i d be afraid i was going too fast and i d slow up then i d get afraid and count fast again,so i never could come out even with the bell and the released surging of feet moving already feeling earth in the scuffed floor and the day like a pane of glass struck a light sharp blow and my insides would move sitting still,faulkner
31545,31546,moving sitting still,my bowels moved for thee,faulkner
31547,31548,one minute she was standing in the door,benjy,faulkner
31549,31550,bellowing,benjamin the child of mine old age bellowing,faulkner
31551,31552,caddy,caddy,faulkner
31553,31554,i m going to run away,he began to cry she went and touched him,faulkner
31555,31556,hush,i m not going to,faulkner
31557,31558,hush,he hushed,faulkner
31559,31560,dilsey,he smell what you tell him when he want to,faulkner
31561,31562,dont have to listen nor talk,can he smell that new name they give him,faulkner
31563,31564,can he smell bad luck,what he want to worry about luck for,faulkner
31565,31566,luck cant do him no hurt,what they change his name for then if aint trying to help his luck,faulkner
31567,31568,the car stopped started stopped again,below the window i watched the crowns of people s heads passing beneath new straw hats not yet unbleached,faulkner
31569,31570,there were women in the car now with market baskets and men in workclothes were beginning to outnumber the shined shoes and collars,the nigger touched my knee,faulkner
31571,31572,pardon me he said,i swung my legs out and let him pass,faulkner
31573,31574,we were going beside a blank wall the sound clattering back into the car at the women with market baskets on their knees and a man in a stained hat with a pipe stuck in the band,i could smell water and in a break in the wall i saw a glint of water and two masts and a gull motionless in midair like on an invisible wire between the masts and i raised my hand and through my coat touched the letters i had written,faulkner
31575,31576,when the car stopped i got off,the bridge was open to let a schooner through,faulkner
31577,31578,she was in tow the tug nudging along under her quarter trailing smoke but the ship herself was like she was moving without visible means,a man naked to the waist was coiling down a line on the fo csle head,faulkner
31579,31580,his body was burned the color of leaf tobacco,another man in a straw hat withoutany crown was at the wheel,faulkner
31581,31582,the ship went through the bridge moving under bare poles like a ghost in broad day with three gulls hovering above the stern like toys on invisible wires,when it closed i crossed to the other side and leaned on the rail above the boathouses,faulkner
31583,31584,the float was empty and the doors were closed,crew just pulled in the late afternoon now resting up before,faulkner
31585,31586,the shadow of the bridge the tiers of railing my shadow leaning flat upon the water so easily had i tricked it that would not quit me,at least fifty feet it was and if i only had something to blot it into the water holding it until it was drowned the shadow of the package like two shoes wrapped up lying on the water,faulkner
31587,31588,niggers say a drowned man s shadow was watching for him in the water all the time,it twinkled and glinted like breathing the float slow like breathing too and debris half submerged healing out to the sea and the caverns and the grottoes of the sea,faulkner
31589,31590,the displacement of water is equal to the something of something,reducto absurdum of all human experience and two sixpound flatirons weigh more than one tailor s goose,faulkner
31591,31592,what a sinful waste dilsey would say,benjy knew it when damuddy died,faulkner
31593,31594,he cried,he smell hit,faulkner
31595,31596,he smell hit,the tug came back downstream the water shearing in long rolling cylinders rocking the float at last with the echo of passage the float lurching onto the rolling cylinder with a plopping sound and a long jarring noise as the door rolled back and two men emerged carrying a shell,faulkner
31597,31598,they set it in the water and a moment later bland came out with the sculls,he wore flannels a gray jacket and a stiff straw hat,faulkner
31599,31600,either he or his mother had read somewhere that oxford students pulled in flannels and stiff hats so early one march they bought gerald a one pair shell and in his flannels and stiff hat he went on the river,the folks at the boathouse threatened to call a policeman but he went anyway,faulkner
31601,31602,his mother came down in a hired auto in a fur suit like an arctic explorer s and saw him off in a twentyfive mile wind and a steady drove of ice floes like dirty sheep,ever since then i have believed that god is not only a gentleman and a sport he is a kentuckian too,faulkner
31603,31604,when he sailed away she made a detour and came down to the river again and drove along parallel with him the car in low gear,they said you could nt have told they d ever seen one another before like a king and queen not even looking at one another just moving side by side across massachusetts on parallel courses like a couple of planets,faulkner
31605,31606,he got in and pulled away,he pulled pretty well now,faulkner
31607,31608,he ought to,they said his mother tried to make him give rowing up and do something else the rest of his class could nt or would nt do but for once he was stubborn,faulkner
31609,31610,if you could call it stubbornness sitting in his attitudes of princely boredom with his curly yellow hair and his violet eyes and his eyelashes and his new york clothes while his mamma was telling us about gerald s horses and gerald s niggers and gerald s women,husbands and fathers in kentucky must have been awful glad when she carried gerald off to cambridge,faulkner
31611,31612,she had an apartment over in town and gerald had one there too besides his rooms in college,she approved of gerald associating with me because i at least revealed a blundering sense of noblesse oblige by getting myself born below mason and dixon and a few others whose geography met the requirements minimum,faulkner
31613,31614,forgave at least,or condoned,faulkner
31615,31616,but since she met spoade coming out of chapel one he said she could nt be a lady no lady would be out at that hour of the night she never had been able to forgive him for having five names including that of a present english ducal house,i m sure she solaced herself by being convinced that some misfit maingault or mortemar had got mixed up with the lodgekeeper s daughter,faulkner
31617,31618,which was quite probable whether she invented it or not,spoade was the world s champion sitteraround no holds barred and gouging discretionary,faulkner

31709,31710,the deacon was nt in sight anywhere,i could extend my hand beyond it,faulkner
31711,31712,feeling father behind me beyond the rasping darkness of summer and august the street lamps father and i protect women from one another from themselves our women women are like that they dont acquire knowledge of people we are for that they are just born with a practical fertility of suspicion that makes a crop every so often and usually right they have an affinity for evil for supplying whatever the evil lacks in itself for drawing it about them instinctively as you do bedclothing in slumber fertilising the mind for it until the evil has served its purpose whether it ever existed or no he was coming along between a couple of freshmen,he had nt quite recovered from the parade for he gave me a salute a very superiorofficerish kind,faulkner

31729,31730,someone spread the story years ago when he first appeared around college from wherever he came from that he was a graduate of the divinity school,and when he came to understand what it meant he was so taken with it that he began to retail the story himself until at last he must have come to believe he really had,faulkner
31731,31732,anyway he related long pointless anecdotes of his undergraduate days speaking familiarly of dead and departed professors by their first names usually incorrect ones,but he had been guide mentor and friend to unnumbered crops of innocent and lonely freshmen and i suppose that with all his petty chicanery and hypocrisy he stank no higher in heaven s nostrils than any other,faulkner

31793,31794,you aint playing a joke on the old nigger is you,you know i m not,faulkner

31829,31830,why nt you keep them hands outen your pockets when you running you could stand up then rolling his head in the cradle rolling it flat across the back,caddy told jason and versh that the reason uncle maury did nt work was that he used to roll his head in the cradle when he was little,faulkner
31831,31832,shreve was coming up the walk shambling fatly earnest his glasses glinting beneath the running leaves like little pools,i gave deacon a note for some things,faulkner

31883,31884,there was a car ready to leave and i found a seat next the window and it started and i watched it sort of frazzle out into slack tide flats and then trees,now and then i saw the river and i thought how nice it would be for them down at new london if the weather and gerald s shell going solemnly up the glinting forenoon and i wondered what the old woman would be wanting now sending me a note before ten oclock in the morning,faulkner

31889,31890,remote cousins and family friends whom mere acquaintanceship invested with a sort of blood obligation noblesse oblige,and she sitting there telling us before their faces what a shame it was that gerald should have all the family looks because a man did nt need it was better off without it but without it a girl was simply lost,faulkner

31901,31902,what are you talking about,i m talking about cruel fate in eight yards of apricot silk and more metal pound for pound than a galley slave and the sole owner and proprietor of the unchallenged peripatetic john of the late confederacy,faulkner
31903,31904,then he told me how she had gone to the proctor to have him moved out and how the proctor had revealed enough low stubbornness to insist on consulting shreve first,then she suggested that he send for shreve right off and do it and he would nt do that so after that she was hardly civil to shreve,faulkner

31939,31940,the stone was cool,walking near it you could feel the coolness,faulkner
31941,31942,only our country was not like this country,there was something about just walking through it,faulkner
31943,31944,a kind of still and violent fecundity that satisfied even breadhunger like,flowing around you not brooding and nursing every niggard stone,faulkner
31945,31946,like it were put to makeshift for enough green to go around among the trees and even the blue of distance not that rich chimaera,told me the bone would have to be broken again and inside me it began to say ah ah ah and i began to sweat,faulkner

31989,31990,whooey,hum awn dawg,faulkner
31991,31992,and we d sit in the dry leaves that whispered a little with the slow respiration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless october the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air listening to the dogs and to the echo of louis voice dying away,he never raised it yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch,faulkner
31993,31994,when he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used but clearer mellower as though his voice were a part of darkness and silence coiling out of it coiling into it again,whoooooo,faulkner
31995,31996,whoooooo,whooooooooooooooooo,faulkner
31997,31998,the bridge was of gray stone lichened dappled with slow moisture where the fungus crept,beneath it the water was clear and still in the shadow whispering and clucking about the stone in fading swirls of spinning sky,faulkner
31999,32000,he went into the woods and did it with a razor sitting in a ditch,a broken razor flinging them backward over his shoulder the same motion complete the jerked skein of blood backward not looping,faulkner
32001,32002,but that s not it,it s not not having them,faulkner
32003,32004,it s never to have had them then i could say o that that s chinese i dont know chinese,and father said it s because you are a virgin dont you see,faulkner
32005,32006,women are never virgins,purity is a negative state and therefore contrary to nature,faulkner
32007,32008,it s nature is hurting you not caddy and i said that s just words and he said so is virginity and i said you dont know,you cant know and he said yes,faulkner
32009,32010,on the instant when we come to realise that tragedy is secondhand,where the shadow of the bridge fell i could see down for a long way but not as far as the bottom,faulkner
32011,32012,when you leave a leaf in water a long time after a while the tissue will be gone and the delicate fibers waving slow as the motion of sleep,they dont touch one another no matter how knotted up they once were no matter how close they lay once to the bones,faulkner
32013,32014,and maybe when he says rise the eyes will come floating up too out of the deep quiet and the sleep to look on glory,and after a while the flat irons would come floating up,faulkner
32015,32016,i hid them under the end of the bridge and went back and leaned on the rail,i could not see the bottom but i could see a long way into the motion of the water before the eye gave out and then i saw a shadow hanging like a fat arrow stemming into the current,faulkner
32017,32018,mayflies skimmed in and out of the shadow of the bridge just above the surface,if it could just be a hell beyond that the clean flame the two of us more than dead,faulkner
32019,32020,then you will have only me then only me then the two of us amid the pointing and the horror beyond the clean flame the arrow increased without motion then in a quick swirl the trout lipped a fly beneath the surface with that sort of gigantic delicacy of an elephant picking up a peanut,the fading vortex drifted away down stream and then i saw the arrow again nose into the current wavering delicately to the motion of the water above which the may flies slanted and poised,faulkner
32021,32022,three boys with fishing poles came onto the bridge and we leaned on the rail and looked down at the trout,they knew the fish,faulkner
32023,32024,he was a neighborhood character,they ve been trying to catch that trout for twentyfive years,faulkner
32025,32026,there s a store in boston offers a twentyfive dollar fishing rod to anybody that can catch him,why dont you all catch him then,faulkner
32027,32028,would nt you like to have a twentyfive dollar fishing rod,yes they said,faulkner
32029,32030,they leaned on the rail looking down at the trout,i sure would one said,faulkner
32031,32032,i would nt take the rod the second said,i d take the money instead,faulkner
32033,32034,maybe they would nt do that the first said,i bet he d make you take the rod,faulkner
32035,32036,then i d sell it,you could nt get twentyfive dollars for it,faulkner
32037,32038,i d take what i could get then,i can catch just as many fish with this pole as i could with a twentyfive dollar one,faulkner
32039,32040,then they talked about what they would do with twentyfive dollars,they all talked at once their voices insistent and contradictory and impatient making of unreality a possibility then a probability then an incontrovertible fact as people will when their desires become words,faulkner
32041,32042,i d buy a horse and wagon the second said,yes you would the others said,faulkner
32043,32044,i would,i know where i can buy one for twentyfive dollars,faulkner
32045,32046,i know the man,who is it,faulkner
32047,32048,that s all right who it is,i can buy it for twentyfive dollars,faulkner
32049,32050,yah the others said,he dont know any such thing,faulkner
32051,32052,he s just talking,do you think so,faulkner
32053,32054,the boy said,they continued to jeer at him but he said nothing more,faulkner
32055,32056,he leaned on the rail looking down at the trout which he had already spent and suddenly the acrimony the conflict was gone from their voices as if to them too it was as though he had captured the fish and bought his horse and wagon they too partaking of that adult trait of being convinced of anything by an assumption of silent superiority,i suppose that people using themselves and each other so much by words are at least consistent in attributing wisdom to a still tongue and for a while i could feel the other two seeking swiftly for some means by which to cope with him to rob him of his horse and wagon,faulkner
32057,32058,you could nt get twentyfive dollars for that pole the first said,i bet anything you could nt,faulkner
32059,32060,what s the man s name,i dare you to tell,faulkner
32061,32062,there aint any such man,ah shut up the second said,faulkner
32063,32064,look,here he comes again,faulkner
32065,32066,they leaned on the rail motionless identical their poles slanting slenderly in the sunlight also identical,the trout rose without haste a shadow in faint wavering increase again the little vortex faded slowly downstream,faulkner
32067,32068,gee the first one murmured,we dont try to catch him anymore he said,faulkner
32069,32070,we just watch boston folks that come out and try,is he the only fish in this pool,faulkner
32071,32072,yes,he ran all the others out,faulkner
32073,32074,the best place to fish around here is down at the eddy,no it aint the second said,faulkner
32075,32076,it s better at bigelow s mill two to one,then they argued for a while about which was the best fishing and then left off all of a sudden to watch the trout rise again and the broken swirl of water suck down a little of the sky,faulkner
32077,32078,i asked how far it was to the nearest town,they told me,faulkner
32079,32080,but the closest car line is that way the second said pointing back down the road,where are you going,faulkner
32081,32082,nowhere,just walking,faulkner
32083,32084,you from the college,yes,faulkner
32085,32086,are there any factories in that town,factories,faulkner
32087,32088,they looked at me,no the second said,faulkner
32089,32090,not there,they looked at my clothes,faulkner
32091,32092,you looking for work,how about bigelow s mill,faulkner
32093,32094,the third said,that s a factory,faulkner
32095,32096,factory my eye,he means a sure enough factory,faulkner
32097,32098,one with a whistle i said,i have nt heard any one oclock whistles yet,faulkner
32099,32100,oh the second said,there s a clock in the unitarial steeple,faulkner
32101,32102,you can find out the time from that,have nt you got a watch on that chain,faulkner
32103,32104,i broke it this morning,i showed them my watch,faulkner
32105,32106,they examined it gravely,it s still running the second said,faulkner
32107,32108,what does a watch like that cost,it was a present i said,faulkner
32109,32110,my father gave it to me when i graduated from high school,are you a canadian,faulkner
32111,32112,the third said,he had red hair,faulkner
32113,32114,canadian,he dont talk like them the second said,faulkner
32115,32116,i ve heard them talk,he talks like they do in minstrel shows,faulkner
32117,32118,say the third said,aint you afraid he ll hit you,faulkner
32119,32120,hit me,you said he talks like a colored man,faulkner
32121,32122,ah dry up the second said,you can see the steeple when you get over that hill there,faulkner
32123,32124,i thanked them,i hope you have good luck,faulkner
32125,32126,only dont catch that old fellow down there,he deserves to be let alone,faulkner
32127,32128,cant anybody catch that fish the first said,they leaned on the rail looking down into the water the three poles like three slanting threads of yellow fire in the sun,faulkner
32129,32130,i walked upon my shadow tramping it into the dappled shade of trees again,the road curved mounting away from the water,faulkner
32131,32132,it crossed the hill then descended winding carrying the eye the mind on ahead beneath a still green tunnel and the square cupola above the trees and the round eye of the clock but far enough,i sat down at the roadside,faulkner
32133,32134,the grass was ankle deep myriad,the shadows on the road were as still as if they had been put there with a stencil with slanting pencils of sunlight,faulkner
32135,32136,but it was only a train and after a while it died away beyond the trees the long sound and then i could hear my watch and the train dying away as though it were running through another month or another summer somewhere rushing away under the poised gull and all things rushing,except gerald,faulkner
32137,32138,he would be sort of grand too pulling in lonely state across the noon rowing himself right out of noon up the long bright air like an apotheosis mounting into a drowsing infinity where only he and the gull the one terrifically motionless the other in a steady and measured pull and recover that partook of inertia itself the world punily beneath their shadows on the sun,they looked at me passing not slowing,faulkner
32139,32140,well i said,i dont see him,faulkner
32141,32142,we did nt try to catch him the first said,you cant catch that fish,faulkner
32143,32144,there s the clock the second said pointing,you can tell the time when you get a little closer,faulkner
32145,32146,yes i said,all right,faulkner
32147,32148,i got up,you all going to town,faulkner
32149,32150,we re going to the eddy for chub the first said,you cant catch anything at the eddy the second said,faulkner
32151,32152,i guess you want to go to the mill with a lot of fellows splashing and scaring all the fish away,you cant catch any fish at the eddy,faulkner
32153,32154,we wont catch none nowhere if we dont go on the third said,i dont see why you keep on talking about the eddy the second said,faulkner
32155,32156,you cant catch anything there,you dont have to go the first said,faulkner
32157,32158,you re not tied to me,let s go to the mill and go swimming the third said,faulkner
32159,32160,i m going to the eddy and fish the first said,you can do as you please,faulkner
32161,32162,say how long has it been since you heard of anybody catching a fish at the eddy,the second said to the third,faulkner
32163,32164,let s go to the mill and go swimming the third said,the cupola sank slowly beyond the trees with the round face of the clock far enough yet,faulkner
32165,32166,we went on in the dappled shade,we came to an orchard pink and white,faulkner
32167,32168,it was full of bees already we could hear them,let s go to the mill and go swimming the third said,faulkner
32169,32170,a lane turned off beside the orchard,the third boy slowed and halted,faulkner
32171,32172,the first went on flecks of sunlight slipping along the pole across his shoulder and down the back of his shirt,come on the third said,faulkner
32173,32174,the second boy stopped too,come on,faulkner
32175,32176,the first boy went on,his bare feet made no sound falling softer than leaves in the thin dust,faulkner
32177,32178,in the orchard the bees sounded like a wind getting up a sound caught by a spell just under crescendo and sustained,the lane went along the wall arched over shattered with bloom dissolving into trees,faulkner
32179,32180,sunlight slanted into it sparse and eager,yellow butterflies flickered along the shade like flecks of sun,faulkner
32181,32182,what do you want to go to the eddy for,the second boy said,faulkner
32183,32184,you can fish at the mill if you want to,ah let him go the third said,faulkner
32185,32186,they looked after the first boy,sunlight slid patchily across his walking shoulders glinting along the pole like yellow ants,faulkner
32187,32188,kenny the second said,they re already in,faulkner
32189,32190,they looked after the first boy,yah they said suddenly go on then mamma s boy,faulkner
32191,32192,if he goes swimming he ll get his head wet and then he ll get a licking,they turned into the lane and went on the yellow butterflies slanting about them along the shade,faulkner
32193,32194,it is because there is nothing else i believe there is something else but there may not be and then i you will find that even injustice is scarcely worthy of what you believe yourself to be he paid me no attention his jaw set in profile his face turned a little away beneath his broken hat,why dont you go swimming with them,faulkner
32195,32196,i said,i said,faulkner
32197,32198,the sound of the bees diminished sustained yet as though instead of sinking into silence silence merely increased between us as water rises,the road curved again and became a street between shady lawns with white houses,faulkner
32199,32200,he climbed a picket fence without looking back and crossed the lawn to a tree and laid the pole down and climbed into the fork of the tree and sat there his back to the road and the dappled sun motionless at last upon his white shirt,else have i thought about i cant even cry i died last year i told you i had but i did nt know then what i meant i did nt know what i was saying some days in late august at home are like this the air thin and eager like this with something in it sad and nostalgic and familiar,faulkner
32201,32202,man the sum of his climatic experiences father said,man the sum of what have you,faulkner
32203,32204,a problem in impure properties carried tediously to an unvarying nil stalemate of dust and desire,elm,faulkner
32205,32206,no ellum,ellum,faulkner
32207,32208,the wheels were spidery,beneath the sag of the buggy the hooves neatly rapid like the motions of a lady doing embroidery diminishing without progress like a figure on a treadmill being drawn rapidly offstage,faulkner
32209,32210,the street turned again,i could see the white cupola the round stupid assertion of the clock,faulkner
32211,32212,hello sister,her face was like a cup of milk dashed with coffee in the sweet warm emptiness,faulkner
32213,32214,anybody here,but she merely watched me until a door opened and the lady came,faulkner
32215,32216,above the counter where the ranks of crisp shapes behind the glass her neat gray face her hair tight and sparse from her neat gray skull spectacles in neat gray rims riding approaching like something on a wire like a cash box in a store,she looked like a librarian,faulkner
32217,32218,from under the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper and laid it on the counter and lifted the two buns out,the little girl watched them with still and unwinking eyes like two currants floating motionless in a cup of weak coffee land of the kike home of the wop,faulkner
32219,32220,watching the bread the neat gray hands a broad gold band on the left forefinger knuckled there by a blue knuckle,do you do your own baking maam,faulkner
32221,32222,sir,she said,faulkner
32223,32224,like that,sir,faulkner
32225,32226,like on the stage,sir,faulkner
32227,32228,five cents,was there anything else,faulkner
32229,32230,no maam,not for me,faulkner
32231,32232,this lady wants something,she was not tall enough to see over the case so she went to the end of the counter and looked at the little girl,faulkner
32233,32234,did you bring her in here,no maam,faulkner
32235,32236,she was here when i came,you little wretch she said,faulkner
32237,32238,she came out around the counter but she did nt touch the little girl,have you got anything in your pockets,faulkner
32239,32240,she has nt got any pockets i said,she was nt doing anything,faulkner
32241,32242,she was just standing here waiting for you,why did nt the bell ring then,faulkner
32243,32244,she glared at me,she just needed a bunch of switches a blackboard behind her x e,faulkner
32245,32246,she ll hide it under her dress and a body d never know it,you child,faulkner
32247,32248,how d you get in here,the little girl said nothing,faulkner
32249,32250,she looked at the woman then she gave me a flying black glance and looked at the woman again,them foreigners the woman said,faulkner
32251,32252,how d she get in without the bell ringing,she came in when i opened the door i said,faulkner
32253,32254,it rang once for both of us,she could nt reach anything from here anyway,faulkner
32255,32256,besides i dont think she would,would you sister,faulkner
32257,32258,the little girl looked at me secretive contemplative,what do you want,faulkner
32259,32260,bread,she extended her fist,faulkner
32261,32262,it uncurled upon a nickel moist and dirty moist dirt ridged into her flesh,the coin was damp and warm,faulkner
32263,32264,i could smell it faintly metallic,have you got a five cent loaf please maam,faulkner
32265,32266,from beneath the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper sheet and laid it on the counter and wrapped a loaf into it,i laid the coin and another one on the counter,faulkner
32267,32268,and another one of those buns please maam,she took another bun from the case,faulkner
32269,32270,give me that parcel she said,i gave it to her and she unwrapped it and put the third bun in and wrapped it and took up the coins and found two coppers in her apron and gave them to me,faulkner
32271,32272,i handed them to the little girl,her fingers closed about them damp and hot like worms,faulkner
32273,32274,you going to give her that bun,the woman said,faulkner
32275,32276,yessum i said,i expect your cooking smells as good to her as it does to me,faulkner
32277,32278,i took up the two packages and gave the bread to the little girl the woman all irongray behind the counter watching us with cold certitude,you wait a minute she said,faulkner
32279,32280,she went to the rear,the door opened again and closed,faulkner
32281,32282,the little girl watched me holding the bread against her dirty dress,what s your name,faulkner
32283,32284,i said,she quit looking at me bu she was still motionless,faulkner
32285,32286,she did nt even seem to breathe,the woman returned,faulkner
32287,32288,she had a funny looking thing in her hand,she carried it sort of like it might have been a dead pet rat,faulkner
32289,32290,here she said,the child looked at her,faulkner
32291,32292,take it the woman said jabbing it at the little girl,it just looks peculiar,faulkner
32293,32294,i calculate you wont know the difference when you eat it,here,faulkner
32295,32296,i cant stand here all day,the child took it still watching her,faulkner
32297,32298,the woman rubbed her hands on her apron,i got to have that bell fixed she said,faulkner
32299,32300,she went to the door and jerked it open,the little bell tinkled once faint and clear and invisible,faulkner
32301,32302,we moved toward the door and the woman s peering back,thank you for the cake i said,faulkner
32303,32304,them foreigners she said staring up into the obscurity where the bell tinkled,take my advice and stay clear of them young man,faulkner

32307,32308,we went out,thank you maam,faulkner
32309,32310,she swung the door to then jerked it open again making the bell give forth its single small note,foreigners she said peering up at the bell,faulkner
32311,32312,we went on,well i said,faulkner
32313,32314,how about some ice cream,she was eating the gnarled cake,faulkner
32315,32316,do you like ice cream,she gave me a black still look chewing,faulkner

32319,32320,she would nt put the loaf down,why not put it down so you can eat better,faulkner
32321,32322,i said offering to take it,but she held to it chewing the ice cream like it was taffy,faulkner
32323,32324,the bitten cake lay on the table,she ate the ice cream steadily then she fell to on the cake again looking about at the showcases,faulkner
32325,32326,i finished mine and we went out,which way do you live,faulkner
32327,32328,i said,a buggy the one with the white horse it was,faulkner

32371,32372,we turned and went back,two men sat in chairs in front of a store,faulkner
32373,32374,do you all know this little girl,she sort of took up with me and i cant find where she lives,faulkner

32403,32404,much obliged,come on sister,faulkner
32405,32406,we went up the street on the shady side where the shadow of the broken facade blotted slowly across the road,we came to the livery stable,faulkner
32407,32408,the marshal was nt there,a man sitting in a chair tilted in the broad low door where a dark cool breeze smelling of ammonia blew among the ranked stalls said to look at the postoffice,faulkner

32427,32428,come on sister,we reached the station and crossed the tracks where the river was,faulkner
32429,32430,a bridge crossed it and a street of jumbled frame houses followed the river backed onto it,a shabby street but with an air heterogeneous and vivid too,faulkner
32431,32432,in the center of an untrimmed plot enclosed by a fence of gaping and broken pickets stood an ancient lopsided surrey and a weathered house from an upper window of which hung a garment of vivid pink,does that look like your house,faulkner
32433,32434,i said,she looked at me over the bun,faulkner
32435,32436,this one,i said pointing,faulkner
32437,32438,she just chewed but it seemed to me that i discerned something affirmative acquiescent even if it was nt eager in her air,this one,faulkner
32439,32440,i said,come on then,faulkner
32441,32442,i entered the broken gate,i looked back at her,faulkner
32443,32444,here,i said,faulkner
32445,32446,this look like your house,she nodded her head rapidly looking at me gnawing into the damp halfmoon of the bread,faulkner
32447,32448,we went on,a walk of broken random flags speared by fresh coarse blades of grass led to the broken stoop,faulkner
32449,32450,there was no movement about the house at all and the pink garment hanging in no wind from the upper window,there was a bell pull with a porcelain knob attached to about six feet of wire when i stopped pulling and knocked,faulkner
32451,32452,the little girl had the crust edgeways in her chewing mouth,a woman opened the door,faulkner
32453,32454,she looked at me then she spoke rapidly to the little girl in italian with a rising inflexion then a pause interrogatory,i said,faulkner
32455,32456,i met her down town,is this your bread,faulkner
32457,32458,no spika the woman said,she spoke to the little girl again,faulkner

32463,32464,the woman shook her head,she spoke rapidly,faulkner
32465,32466,she came to the edge of the porch and pointed down the road speaking,i nodded violently too,faulkner
32467,32468,you come show,i said,faulkner
32469,32470,i took her arm waving my other hand toward the road,she spoke swiftly pointing,faulkner

32473,32474,i nodded again,thanks,faulkner
32475,32476,thanks,thanks,faulkner
32477,32478,i went down the steps and walked toward the gate not running but pretty fast,i reached the gate and stopped and looked at her for a while,faulkner
32479,32480,the crust was gone now and she looked at me with her black friendly stare,the woman stood on the stoop watching us,faulkner
32481,32482,come on then i said,we ll have to find the right one sooner or later,faulkner
32483,32484,she moved along just under my elbow,we went on,faulkner
32485,32486,the houses all seemed empty,not a soul in sight,faulkner
32487,32488,a sort of breathlessness that empty houses have,yet they could nt all be empty,faulkner
32489,32490,all the different rooms if you could just slice the walls away all of a sudden,madam your daughter if you please,faulkner
32491,32492,no,madam for god s sake your daughter,faulkner
32493,32494,she moved along just under my elbow her shiny tight pigtails and then the last house played out and the road curved out of sight beyond a wall following the river,the woman was emerging from the broken gate with a shawl over ner head and clutched under her chary,faulkner
32495,32496,the road curved on empty,i found a coin and gave it to the little girl,faulkner
32497,32498,a quarter,goodbye sister i said,faulkner
32499,32500,then i ran,i ran fast not looking back,faulkner
32501,32502,just before the road curved away i looked back,i entered it and after a while i slowed to a fast walk,faulkner
32503,32504,the lane went between back premises unpainted houses with more of those gay and startling colored garments on lines a barn brokenbacked decaying quietly among rank orchard trees unpruned and weedchoked pink and white and murmurous with sunlight and with bees,i looked back,faulkner
32505,32506,the entrance to the lane was empty,i slowed still more my shadow pacing me dragging its head through the weeds that hid the fence,faulkner
32507,32508,the lane went back to a barred gate became defunctive in grass a mere path scarred quietly into new grass,i climbed the gate into a woodlot and crossed it and came to another wall and followed that one my shadow behind me now,faulkner
32509,32510,there were vines and creepers where at home would be honeysuckle,coming and coming especially in the dusk when it rained getting honeysuckle all mixed up in it as though it were not enough without that not unbearable enough,faulkner
32511,32512,girl s elbows at fifteen father said you swallow like you had a fishbone in your throat what s the matter with you and caddy across the table not to look at me,it s for letting it be some darn town squirt i slapped you you will will you now i guess you say calf rope,faulkner
32513,32514,my red hand coming up out of her face,what do you think of that scouring her head into the,faulkner
32515,32516,grass sticks criescrossed into the flesh tingling scouring her head,i had forgot about the river curving along the road,faulkner
32517,32518,i climbed the wall,and then she watched me jump down holding the loaf against her dress,faulkner
32519,32520,i stood in the weeds and we looked at one another for a while,why did nt you tell me you lived out this way sister,faulkner
32521,32522,the loaf was wearing slowly out of the paper already it needed a new one,well come on then and show me the house,faulkner
32523,32524,not a dirty girl like natalie,it was raining we could hear it on the roof sighing through the high sweet emptiness of the barn,faulkner
32525,32526,there,if you dont get home pretty soon you re going to wear that loaf out,faulkner
32527,32528,and then what ll your mamma say,and i could feel water again running swift and peaceful in the secret shade,faulkner
32529,32530,you live a long way dont you,you re mighty smart to go this far to town by yourself,faulkner
32531,32532,it s like dancing sitting down did you ever dance sitting down,we could hear the rain a rat in the crib the empty barn vacant with horses,faulkner
32533,32534,her stiff little pigtails were bound at the tips with bits of crimson cloth,a corner of the wrapping flapped a little as she walked the nose of the loaf naked,faulkner
32535,32536,i stopped,look here,faulkner
32537,32538,do you live down this road,we have nt passed a house in a mile almost,faulkner
32539,32540,she looked at me black and secret and friendly,where do you live sister,faulkner
32541,32542,dont you live back there in town,there was a bird somewhere in the woods beyond the broken and infrequent slanting of sunlight,faulkner
32543,32544,your papa s going to be worried about you,dont you reckon you ll get a whipping for not coming straight home with that bread,faulkner
32545,32546,the bird whistled again invisible a sound meaningless and profound inflexionless ceasing as though cut off with the blow of a knife and again and that sense of water swift and peaceful above secret places felt not seen not heard,oh hell sister,faulkner
32547,32548,about half the paper hung limp,that s not doing any good now,faulkner
32549,32550,i tore it off and dropped it beside the road,come on,faulkner
32551,32552,we ll have to go back to town,we ll go back along the river,faulkner
32553,32554,we left the road,among the moss little pale flowers grew and the sense of water mute and unseen,faulkner
32555,32556,stay mad,my shirt was getting wet and my hair,faulkner
32557,32558,across the roof hearing the roof loud now i could see natalie going through the garden among the rain,get wet i hope you catch pneumonia go on home cowface,faulkner

32565,32566,she had her back turned i went around in front of her,you know what i was doing,faulkner
32567,32568,she turned her back i went around in front of her the rain creeping into the mud flatting her bod ice through her dress it smelled horrible,i was hugging her that s what i was doing,faulkner
32569,32570,she turned her back i went around in front of her,i was hugging her i tell you,faulkner
32571,32572,they yelled and one rose squatting and sprang among them,they looked like beavers the water ripping about their chins yelling,faulkner
32573,32574,take that girl awayl what did you want to bring a girl here for,we just want to watch you for a while,faulkner
32575,32576,they squatted in the water,their heads drew into a clump atching us then they broke and rushed toward us hurling water with their hands,faulkner
32577,32578,we moved quick,look out boys she wont hurt you,faulkner

32589,32590,they yelled,go on away,faulkner
32591,32592,we went away,they huddled just under the bank their slick heads in a row against the bright water,faulkner
32593,32594,we went on,that s not for us is it,faulkner
32595,32596,the sun slanted through to the moss here and there leveller,poor kid you re just a girl,faulkner
32597,32598,little flowers grew among the moss littler than i had ever seen,you re just a girl,faulkner
32599,32600,poor kid,there was a path curving along beside the water,faulkner
32601,32602,then the water was still again dark and still and swift,nothing but a girl,faulkner
32603,32604,poor sister,we lay in the wet grass panting the rain like cold shot on my back,faulkner
32605,32606,where the rain touched my forehead it began to smart my hand came red away streaking off pink in the rain,you ll have to go home now,faulkner
32607,32608,i ve got to get back to school,look how late it s getting,faulkner

32611,32612,it s wet,i thought we jumped back in time,faulkner
32613,32614,i took my handkerchief and tried to wipe the loaf but the crust began to come off so i stopped,we ll just have to let it dry itself,faulkner
32615,32616,hold it like this,she held it like that,faulkner
32617,32618,it looked kind of like rats had been eating it now,and the water building and building up the squatting back the sloughed mud stinking surfaceward pocking the pattering surface like grease on a hot stove,faulkner
32619,32620,he s in a hurry,there s julio the little girl said and then i saw his italian face and his eyes as he sprang upon me,faulkner
32621,32622,we went down,his hands were jabbing at my face and he was saying something and trying to bite me i reckon and then they hauled him off and held him heaving and thrashing and yelling and they held his arms and he tried to kick me until they dragged him back,faulkner
32623,32624,the little girl was howling holding the loaf in both arms,the half naked boy was darting and jumping up and down clutching his trousers and someone pulled me up in time to see another stark naked figure come around the tranquil bend in the path running and change direction in midstride and leap into the woods a couple of garments rigid as boards behind it,faulkner
32625,32626,julio still struggled,the man who had pulled me up said whoa now,faulkner

32649,32650,i ve a good mind to take you up too for assault and battery,he turned to me again,faulkner

32727,32728,we entered a bare room smelling of stale tobacco,there was a sheet iron stove in the center of a wooden frame filled with sand and a faded map on the wall and the dingy plat of a township,faulkner
32729,32730,behind a scarred littered table a man with a fierce roach of iron gray hair peered at us over steel spectacles,got him did ye anse,faulkner

32839,32840,well bud i reckon you ll do your girl chasing in boston after this,you damned fool shreve said,faulkner
32841,32842,what the hell do you mean anyway straggling off here fooling with these damn wops,come on spoade said,faulkner
32843,32844,they must be getting impatient,mrs bland was talking to them,faulkner
32845,32846,they were miss holmes and miss daingerfield and they quit listening to her and looked at me again with that delicate and curious horror their veils turned back upon their little white noses and their eyes fleeing and mysterious beneath the veils,quentin compson mrs bland said,faulkner
32847,32848,what would your mother say,a young man naturally gets into scrapes but to be arrested on foot by a country policeman,faulkner
32849,32850,what did they think he d done gerald,nothing gerald said,faulkner

32853,32854,he was trying to kidnap that little dirty girl but they caught him in time spoade said,nonsense mrs bland said but her voice sort of died away and she stared at me for a moment and the girls drew their breaths in with a soft concerted sound,faulkner
32855,32856,fiddlesticks mrs bland said briskly,if that is nt just like these ignorant lowclass yankees,faulkner
32857,32858,get in quentin,shreve and i sat on two small collapsible seats,faulkner
32859,32860,gerald cranked the car and got in and we started,now quentin you tell me what all this foolishness is about mrs bland said,faulkner
32861,32862,i told them shreve hunched and furious on his little seat and spoade sitting again on the back of his neck beside miss daingerfield,and the joke is all the time quentin had us all fooled spoade said,faulkner
32863,32864,all the time we thought he was the model youth that anybody could trust a daughter with until the police showed him up at his nefarious work,hush up spoade mrs bland said,faulkner
32865,32866,we drove down the street and crossed the bridge and passed the house where the pink garment hung in the window,that s what you get for not reading my note,faulkner
32867,32868,why did nt you come and get it,mr mackenzie says he told you it was there,faulkner
32869,32870,yessum,i intended to but i never went back to the room,faulkner
32871,32872,you d have let us sit there waiting i dont know how long if it had nt been for mr mackenzie,when he said you had nt come back that left an extra place so we asked him to come,faulkner
32873,32874,we re very glad to have you anyway mr mackenzie,shreve said nothing,faulkner
32875,32876,his arms were folded and he glared straight ahead past gerald s cap,it was a cap for motoring in england,faulkner
32877,32878,mrs bland said so,we passed that house and three others and another yard where the little girl stood by the gate,faulkner
32879,32880,she did nt have the bread now and her face looked like it had been streaked with coaldust,i waved my hand but she made no reply only her head turned slowly as the car passed following us with her unwinking gaze,faulkner
32881,32882,then we ran beside the wall our shadows running along the wall and after a while we passed a piece of torn newspaper lying beside the road and i began to laugh again,i could feel it in my throat and i looked off into the trees where the afternoon slanted thinking of afternoon and of the bird and the boys in swimming,faulkner
32883,32884,but still i could nt stop it and then i knew that if i tried too hard to stop it i d be crying and i thought about how i d thought about i could not be a virgin with so many of them walking along in the shadows and whispering with their soft girlvoices lingering in the shadowy places and the words coming out and perfume and eyes you could feel not see but if it was that simple to do it would nt be anything and if it was nt anything what was i and then mrs bland said quentin,is he sick mr mackenzie,faulkner
32885,32886,and then shreve s fat hand touched my knee and spoade began talking and i quit trying to stop it,if that hamper is in his way mr mackenzie move it over on your side,faulkner
32887,32888,hey shreve,his hand touched my knee again,faulkner
32889,32890,i moved my knee again,i m canadian shreve said,faulkner
32891,32892,i think it s marvellous,did you ever drink perfume,faulkner
32893,32894,spoade said,he would nt even let old wilkie touch it do you remember gerald but always gathered it himself and made his own julep,faulkner
32895,32896,he was as crotchety about his julep as an old maid measuring everything by a recipe in his head,i could hear shreve working the pump then he came back with the basin and a round blob of twilight wobbling in it with a yellow edge like a fading balloon then my reflection,faulkner
32897,32898,i tried to see my face in it,has it stopped,faulkner
32899,32900,shreve said,give me the rag,faulkner
32901,32902,he tried to take it from my hand,look out i said,faulkner
32903,32904,i can do it,yes it s about stopped now,faulkner
32905,32906,i dipped the rag again breaking the balloon,the rag stained the water,faulkner
32907,32908,i wish i had a clean one,you need a piece of beefsteak for that eye shreve said,faulkner
32909,32910,damn if you wont have a shiner tomorrow,the son of a bitch he said,faulkner
32911,32912,did i hurt him any,i wrung out the handkerchief and tried to clean the blood off of my vest,faulkner
32913,32914,you cant get that off shreve said,you ll have to send it to the cleaner s,faulkner
32915,32916,come on hold it on your eye why dont you,i can get some of it off i said,faulkner
32917,32918,but i was nt doing much good,what sort of shape is my collar in,faulkner
32919,32920,i dont know shreve said,hold it against your eye,faulkner
32921,32922,here,look out i said,faulkner
32923,32924,i can do it,did i hurt him any,faulkner
32925,32926,you may have hit him,i may have looked away just then or blinked or something,faulkner
32927,32928,he boxed the hell out of you,he boxed you all over the place,faulkner
32929,32930,what did you want to fight him with your fists for,you goddam fool,faulkner
32931,32932,how do you feel,i feel fine i said,faulkner
32933,32934,i wonder if i can get something to clean my vest,oh forget your damn clothes,faulkner
32935,32936,does your eye hurt,i feel fine i said,faulkner
32937,32938,everything was sort of violet and still the sky green paling into gold beyond the gable of the house and a plume of smoke rising from the chimney without any wind,i heard the pump again,faulkner
32939,32940,a man was filling a pail watching us across his pumping shoulder,a woman crossed the door but she did nt look out,faulkner
32941,32942,i could hear a cow lowing somewhere,come on shreve said,faulkner
32943,32944,let your clothes alone and put that rag on your eye,i ll send your suit out first thing tomorrow,faulkner
32945,32946,all right,i m sorry i did nt bleed on him a little at least,faulkner
32947,32948,son of a bitch shreve said,spoade came out of the house talking to the woman i reckon and crossed the yard,faulkner
32949,32950,he looked at me with his cold quizzical eyes,well bud he said looking at me i ll be damned if you dont go to a lot of trouble to have your fun,faulkner
32951,32952,kidnapping then fighting,what do you do on your holidays,faulkner
32953,32954,burn houses,i m all right i said,faulkner
32955,32956,what did mrs bland say,she s giving gerald hell for bloodying you up,faulkner
32957,32958,she ll give you hell for letting him when she sees you,she dont object to the fighting it s the blood that annoys her,faulkner
32959,32960,i think you lost caste with her a little by not holding your blood better,how do you feel,faulkner
32961,32962,sure shreve said,if you cant be a bland the next best thing is to commit adultery with one or get drunk and fight him as the case may be,faulkner
32963,32964,quite right spoade said,but i did nt know quentin was drunk,faulkner
32965,32966,he was nt shreve said,do you have to be drunk to want to hit that son of a bitch,faulkner
32967,32968,well i think i d have to be pretty drunk to try it after seeing how quentin came out,where d he learn to box,faulkner
32969,32970,he s been going to mike s every day over in town i said,he has,faulkner
32971,32972,spoade said,did you know that when you hit him,faulkner
32973,32974,i dont know i said,i guess so,faulkner
32975,32976,yes,wet it again shreve said,faulkner
32977,32978,want some fresh water,this is all right i said,faulkner
32979,32980,i dipped the cloth again and held it to my eye,wish i had something to clean my vest,faulkner
32981,32982,spoade was still watching me,say he said,faulkner
32983,32984,what did you hit him for,what was it he said,faulkner
32985,32986,i dont know,i dont know why i did,faulkner
32987,32988,the first i knew was when you jumped up all of a sudden and said did you ever have a sister,did you,faulkner
32989,32990,and when he said no you hit him,i noticed you kept on looking at him but you did nt seem to be paying any attention to what anybody was saying until you jumped up and asked him if he had any sisters,faulkner
32991,32992,ah he was blowing off as usual shreve said about his women,you know like he does before girls so they dont know exactly what he s saying,faulkner
32993,32994,all his damn innuendo and lying and a lot of stuff that dont make sense even,telling us about some wench that he made a date with to meet at a dance hall in atlantic city and stood her up and went to the hotel and went to bed and how he lay there being sorry for her waiting on the pier for him without him there to give her what she wanted,faulkner
32995,32996,talking about the body s beauty and the sorry ends thereof and how tough women have it without anything else they can do except lie on their backs,leda lurking in the bushes whimpering and moaning for the swan see,faulkner
32997,32998,the son of a bitch,i d hit him myself,faulkner
32999,33000,only i d grabbed up her damn hamper of wine and done it if it had been me,oh spoade said the champion of dames,faulkner
33001,33002,bud you excite not only admiration but horror,he looked at me cold and quizzical,faulkner
33003,33004,good god he said,i m sorry i hit him i said,faulkner
33005,33006,do i look too bad to go back and get it over with,apologies hell shreve said,faulkner
33007,33008,let them go to hell,we re going to town,faulkner
33009,33010,he ought to go back so they ll know he fights like a gentleman spoade said,gets licked like one i mean,faulkner
33011,33012,like this,shreve said,faulkner
33013,33014,with his clothes all over blood,why all right spoade said,faulkner
33015,33016,you know best,he cant go around in his undershirt shreve said,faulkner
33017,33018,he s not a senior yet,come on let s go to town,faulkner
33019,33020,you need nt come i said,you go on back to the picnic,faulkner
33021,33022,hell with them shreve said,come on here,faulkner
33023,33024,what ll i tell them,spoade said,faulkner
33025,33026,tell them you and quentin had a fight too,tell them nothing shreve said,faulkner
33027,33028,tell her her option expired at sunset,come on quentin,faulkner
33029,33030,i m not going back to town,shreve stopped looking at me,faulkner
33031,33032,turning his glasses looked like small yellow moons,what are you going to do,faulkner
33033,33034,i m not going back to town yet,you go on back to the picnic,faulkner
33035,33036,tell them i would nt come back because my clothes were spoiled,look here he said,faulkner
33037,33038,what are you up to,nothing,faulkner
33039,33040,i m all right,you and spoade go on back,faulkner
33041,33042,i ll see you tomorrow,i went on across the yard toward the road,faulkner
33043,33044,do you know where the station is,shreve said,faulkner
33045,33046,i ll find it,i ll see you all tomorrow,faulkner
33047,33048,tell mrs bland i m sorry i spoiled her party,they stood watching me,faulkner
33049,33050,i went around the house,a rock path went down to the road,faulkner
33051,33052,roses grew on both sides of the path,i went through the gate onto the road,faulkner
33053,33054,it dropped downhill toward the woods and i could make out the auto beside the road,i went up the hill,faulkner
33055,33056,the light increased as i mounted and before i reached the top i heard a car,it sounded far away across the twilight and i stopped and listened to it,faulkner
33057,33058,i could nt make out the auto any longer but shreve was standing in the road before the house looking up the hill,behind him the yellow light lay like a wash of paint on the roof of the house,faulkner
33059,33060,i lifted my hand and went on over the hill listening to the car,then the house was gone and i stopped in the green and yellow light and heard the car growing louder and louder until just as it began to die away it ceased all together,faulkner
33061,33062,i waited until i heard it start again,then i went on,faulkner
33063,33064,as i descended the light dwindled slowly yet at the same time without altering its quality as if i and not light were changing decreasing though even when the road ran into trees you could have read a newspaper,pretty soon i came to a lane,faulkner
33065,33066,i turned into it,it was closer and darker than the road but when it came out at the trolley stop another wooden marquee the light was still unchanged,faulkner
33067,33068,after the lane it seemed brighter as though i had walked through night in the lane and come out into morning again,pretty soon the car came,faulkner
33069,33070,i got on it they turning to look at my eye and found a seat on the left side,the lights were on in the car so while we ran between trees i could nt see anything except my own face and a woman across the aisle with a hat sitting right on top of her head with a broken feather in it but when we ran out of the trees i could see the twilight again that quality of light as if time really had stopped for a while with the sun hanging just under the horizon and then we passed the marquee where the old man had been eating out of the sack and the road going on under the twilight into twilight and the sense of water peaceful and swift beyond,faulkner
33071,33072,then the car went on the draft building steadily up in the open door until it was drawing steadily through the car with the odor of summer and darkness except honeysuckle,honeysuckle was the saddest odor of all i think,faulkner
33073,33074,i remember lots of them,wistaria was one,faulkner
33075,33076,on the rainy days when mother was nt feeling quite bad enough to stay away from the windows we used to play under it,when mother stayed in bed dilsey would put old clothes on us and let us go out in the rain because she said rain never hurt young folks,faulkner
33077,33078,but if mother was up we always began by playing on the porch until she said we were making too much noise then we went out and played under the wisteria frame,this was where i saw the river for the last time this morning about here,faulkner
33079,33080,i could feel water beyond the twilight smell,when it bloomed in the spring and it rained the smell was everywhere you did nt notice it so much at other times but when it rained the smell began to come into the house at twilight either it would rain more at twilight or there was something in the light itself but it always smelled strongest then until i would lie in bed thinking when will it stop when will it stop,faulkner
33081,33082,the draft in the door smelled of water a damp steady breath,sometimes i could put myself to sleep saying that over and over until after the honeysuckle got all mixed up in it the whole thing came to symbolis night and unrest i seemed to be lying neither asleep nor awake looking down a long corridor of gray halflight where all stable things had become shadowy paradoxical all i had done shadows all i had felt suffered taking visible form antic and perverse mocking without relevance inherent themselves with the denial of the significance they should have affirmed thinking i was i was not who was not was not who,faulkner
33083,33084,i could smell the curves of the river beyond the dusk and i saw the last light supine and tranquil upon tideflats like pieces of broken mirror then beyond them lights began in the pale clear air trembling a little like butterflies hovering a long way off,benjamin the child of,faulkner
33085,33086,how he used to sit before that mirror,refuge unfailing in which conflict tempered silenced reconciled,faulkner
33087,33088,benjamin the child of mine old age held hostage into egypt,o benjamin,faulkner
33089,33090,dilsey said it was because mother was too proud for him,they come into white people s lives like that in sudden sharp black trickles that isolate white facts for an instant in unarguable truth like under a microscope the rest of the time just voices that laugh when you see nothing to laugh at tears when no reason for tears,faulkner
33091,33092,they will bet on the odd or even number of mourners at a funeral,a brothel full of them in memphis went into a religious trance ran naked into the street,faulkner
33093,33094,it took three policemen to subdue one of them,yes jesus o good man jesus o that good man,faulkner
33095,33096,the car stopped,i got out with them looking at my eye,faulkner
33097,33098,when the trolley came it was full,i stopped on the back platform,faulkner
33099,33100,seats up front the conductor said,i looked into the car,faulkner
33101,33102,there were no seats on the left side,i m not going far i said,faulkner
33103,33104,i ll just stand here,we crossed the river,faulkner
33105,33106,the bridge that is arching slow and high into space between silence and nothingness where lights yellow and red and green trembled in the clear air repeating themselves,better go up front and get a seat the conductor said,faulkner
33107,33108,i get off pretty soon i said,a couple of blocks,faulkner
33109,33110,i got off before we reached the postoffice,they d all be sitting around somewhere by now though and then i was hearing my watch and i began to listen for the chimes and i touched shreve s letter through my coat the bitten shadows of the elms flowing upon my hand,faulkner
33111,33112,and then as i turned into the quad the chimes did begin and i went on while the notes came up like ripples on a pool and passed me and went on saying quarter to what,all right,faulkner
33113,33114,quarter to what,our windows were dark,faulkner
33115,33116,the entrance was empty,i walked close to the left wall when i entered but it was empty just the stairs curving up into shadows echoes of feet in the sad generations like light dust upon the shadows my feet waking them like dust lightly to settle again,faulkner
33117,33118,i could see the letter before i turned the light on propped against a book on the table so i would see it,calling him my husband,faulkner
33119,33120,and then spoade said they were going somewhere would not be back until late and mrs bland would need another cavalier,but i would have seen him and he can not get another car for an hour because after six oclock,faulkner
33121,33122,i took out my watch and listened to it clicking away not knowing it could nt even lie,then i laid it face up on the table and took mrs bland s letter and tore it across and dropped the pieces into the waste basket and took off my coat vest collar tie and shirt,faulkner
33123,33124,the tie was spoiled too but then niggers,maybe a pattern of blood he could call that the one christ was wearing,faulkner
33125,33126,i found the gasoline in shreve s room and spread the vest on the table where it would be flat and opened the gasoline,the first car in town a girl girl that s what jason could nt bear smell of gasoline making him sick then got madder than ever because a girl girl had no sister but benjamin benjamin the child of my sorrowful if i d just had a mother so i could say mother mother it took a lot of gasoline and then i could nt tell if it was still the stain or just the gasoline,faulkner
33127,33128,it had started the cut to smarting again so when i went to wash i hung the vest on a chair and lowered the light cord so that the bulb would be drying the splotch,i washed my face and hands but even then i could smell it within the soap stinging constricting the nostrils a little,faulkner
33129,33130,then i opened the bag and took the shirt and collar and tie out and put the bloody ones in and closed the bag and dressed,while i was brushing my hair the half hour went,faulkner
33131,33132,i stood at the window the curtains moved slow out of the darkness touching my face like someone breathing asleep breathing slow into the darkness again leaving the touch,after they had gone up stairs mother lay back in her chair the camphor handker chief to her mouth,faulkner
33133,33134,father had nt moved he still sat beside her holding her hand the bellowing hammering away like no place for it in silence when i was little there was a picture in one of our books a dark place into which a single weak ray of light came slanting upon two faces lifted out of the shadow,you know what i d do if i were king,faulkner
33135,33136,she never was a queen or a fairy she was always a king or a giant or a general i d break that place open and drag them out and i d whip them good it was torn out jagged out,i was glad,faulkner
33137,33138,i d have to turn back to it until the dungeon was mother herself she and father upward into weak light holding hands and us lost somewhere below even them without even a ray of light,then the honeysuckle got into it,faulkner
33139,33140,as soon as i turned off the light and tried to go to sleep it would begin to come into the room in waves building and building up until i would have to pant to get any air at all out of it until i would have to get up and feel my way like when i was a little boy hands can see touching in the mind shaping unseen door door now nothing hands can see my nose could see gasoline the vest on the table the door,the corridor was still empty of all the feet in sad generations seeking water,faulkner
33141,33142,yet the eyes unseeing clenched like teeth not disbelieving doubting even the absence of pain shin ankle knee the long invisible flowing of the stairrailing where a misstep in the darkness filled with sleeping mother father caddy jason maury door i am not afraid only mother father caddy jason maury getting so far ahead sleeping i will sleep fast when i door door door it was empty too the pipes the porcelain the stained quiet walls the throne of contemplation,i had forgotten the glass but i could hands can see cooling fingers invisible swanthroat where less than moses rod the glass touch tentative not to drumming lean cool throat drumming cooling the metal the glass full overfull cooling the glass the fingers flushing sleep leaving the taste of dampened sleep in the long silence of the throat i returned up the corridor waking the lost feet in whispering battalions in the silence into the gasoline the watch telling its furious lie on the dark table,faulkner
33143,33144,then the curtains breathing out of the dark upon my face leaving the breathing upon my face,a quarter hour yet,faulkner

33167,33168,sir i will not need shreve s i have sold benjy s pasture and i can be dead in harvard caddy said in the caverns and the grottoes of the sea tumbling peacefully to the wavering tides because harvard is such a fine sound forty acres is no high price for a fine sound,a fine dead sound we will swap benjy s pasture for a fine dead sound,faulkner
33169,33170,it will last him a long time because he can not hear it unless he can smell it as soon as she came in the door he began to cry i thought all the time it was just one of those town squirts that father was always teasing her about until,women only use other people s codes of honor it s because she loves caddy staying downstairs even when she was sick so father could nt kid uncle maury before jason father said uncle maury was too poor a classicist to risk the blind immortal boy in person he should have chosen jason because jason would have made only the same kind of blunder uncle maury himself would have made not one to get him a black eye the patterson boy was smaller than jason too they sold the kites for a nickel a piece until the trouble over finances jason got a new partner still smaller one small enough anyway because t p said jason still treasurer but father said why should uncle maury work if he father could support five or six niggers that did nothing at all but sit with their feet in the oven he certainly could board and lodge uncle maury now and then and lend him a little money who kept his father s belief in the celestial derivation of his own species at such a fine heat then mother would cry and say that father believed his people were better than hers that he was ridiculing uncle maury to teach us the same thing she could nt see that father was teaching us that all men are just accumulations dolls stuffed with sawdust swept up from the trash heaps where all previous dolls had been thrown away the sawdust flowing from what wound in what side that not for me died not,faulkner
33171,33172,the first note sounded measured and tranquil serenely peremptory emptying the unhurried silence for the next one and that s it if people could only change one another forever that way merge like a flame swirling up for an instant then blown cleanly out along the cool eternal dark instead of iying there trying not to think of the swing until all cedars came to have that vivid dead smell of perfume that benjy hated so,at last it stopped vibrating and the darkness was still again,faulkner
33173,33174,i entered the sitting room and turned on the light,i put my vest on,faulkner

33187,33188,i says she ought to be down there in that kitchen right now instead of up there in her room gobbing paint on her face and waiting for six niggers that cant even stand up out of a chair unless they ve got a pan full of bread and meat to balance them to fix breakfast for her,you cant can you,faulkner

33523,33524,get those things out of the crates now and drag them inside,i opened her letter first and took the check out,faulkner
33525,33526,just like a woman,six days late,faulkner
33527,33528,yet they try to make men believe that they re capable of conducting a business,how long would a man that thought the first of the month came on the sixth last in business,faulkner
33529,33530,and like as not when they sent the bank statement out she would want to know why i never deposited my salary until the sixth,things like that never occur to a woman,faulkner
33531,33532,i had no answer to my letter about quentin s easter dress,did it arrive all right,faulkner
33533,33534,i ve had no answer to the last two letters i wrote her though the check in the second one was cashed with the other check,is she sick,faulkner

33541,33542,you d better wire me at once about her to this address,about that time earl started yelling at job so i put them away and went over to try to put some life into him,faulkner
33543,33544,what this country needs is white labor,let these dam trifling niggers starve for a couple of years then they d see what a soft thing they have,faulkner
33545,33546,along toward ten oclock i went up front,there was a drummer there,faulkner
33547,33548,it was a couple of minutes to ten and i invited him up the street to get a dope,we got to talking about crops,faulkner
33549,33550,there s nothing to it i says,cotton is a speculator s crop,faulkner
33551,33552,they fill the farmer full of hot air and get him to raise a big crop for them to whipsaw on the market to trim the suckers with,do you think the farmer gets anything out of it except a red neck and a hump in his back,faulkner
33553,33554,you think the man that sweats to put it into the ground gets a red cent more than a bare living i says,let him make a big crop and it wont be worth picking let him make a small crop and he wont have enough to gin,faulkner
33555,33556,and what for,so a bunch of dam eastern jews i m not talking about men of the jewish religion i says,faulkner
33557,33558,i ve known some jews that were fine citizens,you might be one yourself i says,faulkner
33559,33560,no he says,i m an american,faulkner
33561,33562,no offense i says,i give every man his due regardless of religion or anything else,faulkner
33563,33564,i have nothing against jews as an individual i says,it s just the race,faulkner
33565,33566,you ll admit that they produce nothing,they follow the pioneers into a new country and sell them clothes,faulkner
33567,33568,you re thinking of armenians he says are nt you,a pioneer would nt have any use for new clothes,faulkner
33569,33570,no offense i says,i dont hold a man s religion against him,faulkner
33571,33572,sure he says,i m an american,faulkner
33573,33574,my folks have some french blood why i have a nose like this,i m an american all right,faulkner
33575,33576,so am i i says,not many of us left,faulkner
33577,33578,what i m talking about is the fellows that sit up there in new york and trim the sucker gamblers,that s right he says,faulkner
33579,33580,nothing to gambling for a poor man,there ought to be a law against it,faulkner
33581,33582,dont you think i m right,i says,faulkner
33583,33584,yes he says,i guess you re right,faulkner
33585,33586,the farmer catches it coming and going,i know i m right i says,faulkner
33587,33588,it s a sucker game unless a man gets inside information from somebody that knows what s going on,i happen to be associated with some people who re right there on the ground,faulkner
33589,33590,they have one of the biggest manipulators in new york for an adviser,way i do it i says i never risk much at a time,faulkner
33591,33592,it s the fellow that thinks he knows it all and is trying to make a killing with three dollars that they re laying for,that s why they are in the business,faulkner
33593,33594,then it struck ten,i went up to the telegraph office,faulkner
33595,33596,it opened up a little just like they said,i went into the corner and took out the telegram again just to be sure,faulkner
33597,33598,while i was looking at it a report came in,it was up two points,faulkner
33599,33600,they were all buying,i could tell that from what they were saying,faulkner
33601,33602,getting aboard,like they did nt know it could go but one way,faulkner
33603,33604,like there was a law or something against doing anything but buying,well i reckon those eastern jews have got to live too,faulkner
33605,33606,but i ll be damned if it has nt come to a pretty pass when any dam foreigner that cant make a living in the country where god put him can come to this one and take money right out of an american s pockets,it was up two points more,faulkner
33607,33608,four points,but hell they were right there and knew what was going on,faulkner
33609,33610,and if i was nt going to take the advice what was i paying them ten dollars a month for,i went out then i remembered and came back and sent the wire,faulkner
33611,33612,all well,q writing today,faulkner
33613,33614,q,the operator says,faulkner
33615,33616,yes i says,q cant you spell q,faulkner

33619,33620,send it collect,what you sending jason,faulkner
33621,33622,doc wright says looking over my shoulder,is that a code message to buy,faulkner
33623,33624,that s all right about that i says,you boys use your own judgment,faulkner
33625,33626,you know more about it than those new york folks do,well i ought to doc says,faulkner
33627,33628,i d a saved money this year raising it at two cents a pound,another report came in,faulkner
33629,33630,it was down a point,jason s selling hopkins says,faulkner
33631,33632,look at his face,that s all right about what i m doing i says,faulkner
33633,33634,you boys follow your own judgment,those rich new york jews have got to live like everybody else i says,faulkner
33635,33636,i went on back to the store,earl was busy up front,faulkner
33637,33638,i went on back to the desk and read lorraine s letter,dear daddy wish you were here,faulkner
33639,33640,no good parties when daddys out of town i miss my sweet daddy,i reckon she does,faulkner
33641,33642,last time i gave her forty dollars,gave it to her,faulkner
33643,33644,i never promise a woman anything nor let her know what i m going to give her,that s the only way to manage them,faulkner
33645,33646,always keep them guessing,if you cant think of any other way to surprise them give them a bust in the jaw,faulkner
33647,33648,i tore it up and burned it over the spittoon,i make it a rule never to keep a scrap of paper bearing a woman s hand and i never write them at all,faulkner
33649,33650,lorraine is always after me to write to her but i says anything i forgot to tell you will save till i get to memphis again but i says i dont mind you writing me now and then in a plain envelope but if you ever try to call me up on the telephone memphis wont hold you i says,i says when i m up there i m one of the boys but i m not going to have any woman calling me on the telephone,faulkner
33651,33652,here i says giving her the forty dollars,if you ever get drunk and take a notion to call me on the phone just remember this and count ten before you do it,faulkner
33653,33654,when ll that be,she says,faulkner
33655,33656,what,i says,faulkner
33657,33658,when you re coming back she says,i ll let you know i says,faulkner
33659,33660,then she tried to buy a beer but i would nt let her,keep your money i says,faulkner
33661,33662,buy yourself a dress with it,i gave the maid a five too,faulkner
33663,33664,after all like i say money has no value it s just the way you spend it,it dont belong to anybody so why try to hoard it,faulkner
33665,33666,it just belongs to the man that can get it and keep it,there s a man right here in jefferson made a lot of money selling rotten goods to niggers lived in a room over the store about the size of a pigpen and did his own cooking,faulkner
33667,33668,about four or five years ago he was taken sick,scared the hell out of him so that when he was up again he joined the church and bought himself a chinese missionary five thousand dollars a year,faulkner
33669,33670,i often think how mad he ll be if he was to die and find out there s not any heaven when he thinks about that five thousand a year,like i say he d better go on and die now and save money,faulkner
33671,33672,when it was burned good i was just about to shove the others into my coat when all of a sudden something told me to open quentin s before i went home but about that time earl started yelling for me up front so i put them away and went and waited on the dam redneck while he spent fifteen minutes deciding whether he wanted a twenty cent hame string or a thirtyfive cent one,you d better take that good one i says,faulkner
33673,33674,how do you fellows ever expect to get ahead trying to work with cheap equipment,if this one aint any good he says why have you got it on sale,faulkner
33675,33676,i did nt say it was nt any good i says,i said it s not as good as that other one,faulkner
33677,33678,how do you know it s not he says,you ever use airy one of them,faulkner
33679,33680,because they dont ask thirtyfive cents for it i says,that s how i know it s not as good,faulkner
33681,33682,he held the twenty cent one in his hands drawing it through his fingers,i reckon i ll take this hyer one he says,faulkner
33683,33684,i offered to take it and wrap it but he rolled it up and put it in his overalls,then he took out a tobacco sack and finally got it untied and shook some coins out,faulkner
33685,33686,he handed me a quarter,that fifteen cents will buy me a snack of dinner he says,faulkner
33687,33688,all right i says,you re the doctor,faulkner
33689,33690,but dont come complaining to me next year when you have to buy a new outfit,i aint makin next year s crop yit he says,faulkner
33691,33692,finally i got rid of him but every time i took that letter out something would come up,they were all in town for the show coming in in droves to give their money to something that brought nothing to the town and would nt leave anything except what those grafters in the mayor s office will split among themselves and earl chasing back and forth like a hen in a coop saying yes maam mr compson will wait on you,faulkner
33693,33694,jason show this lady a churn or a nickel s worth of screen hooks,well jason likes work,faulkner
33695,33696,i says no i never had university advantages because at harvard they teach you how to go for a swim at night without knowing how to swim and at sewanee they dont even teach you what water is,i says you might send me to the state university maybe i ll learn how to stop my clock with a nose spray and then you can send ben to the navy i says or to the cavalry anyway they use geldings in the cavalry,faulkner
33697,33698,then when she sent quentin home for me to feed too i says i guess that s right too instead of me having to go way up north for a job they sent the job down here to me and then mother begun to cry and i says it s not that i have any objection to having it here if it s any satisfaction to you i ll quit work and nurse it myself and let you and dilsey keep the flour barrel full or ben,rent him out to a sideshow there must be folks somewhere that would pay a dime to see him then she cried more and kept saying my poor afflicted baby and i says yes he ll be quite a help to you when he gets his growth not being more than one and a half times as high as me now and she says she d be dead soon and then we d all be better off and so i says all right all right have it your way,faulkner
33699,33700,it s your grandchild which is more than any other grandparents it s got can say for certain,only i says it s only a question of time,faulkner
33701,33702,if you believe she ll do what she says and not try to see it you fool yourself because the first time that was the mother kept on saying thank god you are not a compson except in name because you are all i have left now you and maury and i says well i could spare uncle maury myself and then they came and said they were ready to start,mother stopped crying then,faulkner
33703,33704,she pulled her veil down and we went down stairs,uncle maury was coming out of the diningroom his handkerchief to his mouth,faulkner
33705,33706,they kind of made a lane and we went out the door just in time to see dilsey driving ben and t p back around the corner,we went down the steps and got in,faulkner
33707,33708,uncle maury kept saying poor little sister poor little sister talking around his mouth and patting mother s hand,talking around whatever it was,faulkner
33709,33710,have you got your band on,she says,faulkner
33711,33712,why dont they go on before benjamin comes out and makes a spectacle,poor little boy,faulkner
33713,33714,he does nt know,he cant even realise,faulkner
33715,33716,there there uncle maury says patting her hand talking around his mouth,it s better so,faulkner
33717,33718,let him be unaware of bereavement until he has to,other women have their children to support them in times like this mother says,faulkner
33719,33720,you have jason and me he says,it s so terrible to me she says,faulkner
33721,33722,having the two of them like this in less than two years,there there he says,faulkner
33723,33724,after a while he kind of sneaked his hand to his mouth and dropped them out the window,then i knew what i had been smelling,faulkner
33725,33726,clove stems,i reckon he thought that the least he could do at father s or maybe the sideboard thought it was still father and tripped him up when he passed,faulkner
33727,33728,like i say if he had to sell something to send quentin to harvard we d all been a dam sight better off if he d sold that sideboard and bought himself a onearmed strait jacket with part of the money,i reckon the reason all the compson gave out before it got to me like mother says is that he drank it up,faulkner
33729,33730,at least i never heard of him offering to sell anything to send me to harvard,so he kept on patting her hand and saying poor little sister patting her hand with one of the black gloves that we got the bill for four days later because it was the twentysixth because it was the same day one month that father went up there and got it and brought it home and would nt tell anything about where she was or anything and mother crying and saying and you did nt even see him,faulkner
33731,33732,you did nt even try to get him to make any provision for it,and father says no she shall not touch his money not one cent of it and mother says he can be forced to by law,faulkner
33733,33734,he can prove nothing unless jason compson she says,and whar else do she belong,faulkner
33735,33736,dilsey says,who else gwine raise her cep me,faulkner
33737,33738,aint i raised ev y one of yall,and a dam fine job you made of it i says,faulkner
33739,33740,anyway it ll give her something to sure enough worry over now,so we carried the cradle down and dilsey started to set it up in her old room,faulkner
33741,33742,then mother started sure enough,hush miss cahline dilsey says,faulkner
33743,33744,you gwine wake her up,in there,faulkner
33745,33746,mother says,to be contaminated by that atmosphere,faulkner
33747,33748,it ll be hard enough as it is with the heritage she already has,hush father says,faulkner
33749,33750,dont be silly,why aint she gwine sleep in here dilsey says,faulkner
33751,33752,in the same room whar i put her maw to bed ev y night of her life since she was big enough to sleep by herself,you dont know mother says,faulkner
33753,33754,to have my own daughter cast off by her husband,poor little innocent baby she says looking at quentin,faulkner
33755,33756,you will never know the suffering you ve caused,hush caroline father says,faulkner
33757,33758,what you want to go on like that fo jason fer,dilsey says,faulkner
33759,33760,i ve tried to protect him mother says,i ve always tried to protect him from it,faulkner
33761,33762,at least i can do my best to shield her,how sleepin in dis room gwine hurt her i like to know dilsey says,faulkner
33763,33764,i cant help it mother says,i know i m just a troublesome old woman,faulkner
33765,33766,but i know that people can not flout god s laws with impunity,nonsense father says,faulkner
33767,33768,fix it in miss caroline s room then dilsey,you can say nonsense mother says,faulkner
33769,33770,but she must never know,she must never even learn that name,faulkner
33771,33772,dilsey i forbid you ever to speak that name in her hearing,if she could grow up never to know that she had a mother i would thank god,faulkner
33773,33774,dont be a fool father says,i have never interfered with the way you brought them up mother says,faulkner
33775,33776,but now i can not stand anymore,we must decide this now tonight,faulkner
33777,33778,either that name is never to be spoken in her hearing or she must go or i will go,take your choice,faulkner
33779,33780,hush father says,you re just upset,faulkner
33781,33782,fix it in here dilsey,en you s about sick too dilsey says,faulkner
33783,33784,you looks like a hant,you git in bed and i ll fix you a toddy and see kin you sleep,faulkner
33785,33786,i bet you aint had a full night s sleep since you lef,no mother says,faulkner
33787,33788,dont you know what the doctor says,why must you encourage him to drink,faulkner
33789,33790,that s what s the matter with him now,look at me i suffer too but i m not so weak that i must kill myself with whiskey,faulkner
33791,33792,fiddlesticks father says,what do doctors know,faulkner
33793,33794,they make their livings advising people to do whatever they are not doing at the time which is the extent of anyone s knowledge of the degenerate ape,you ll have a minister in to hold my hand next,faulkner
33795,33796,then mother cried and he went out,went down stairs and then i heard the sideboard,faulkner
33797,33798,i woke up and heard him going down again,mother had gone to sleep or something because the house was quiet at last,faulkner
33799,33800,he was trying to be quiet too because i could nt hear him only the bottom of his nightshirt and his bare legs in front of the sideboard,dilsey fixed the cradle and undressed her and put her in it,faulkner
33801,33802,she never had waked up since he brought her in the house,she pretty near too big fer hit dilsey says,faulkner
33803,33804,dar now,i gwine spread me a pallet right across de hall so you wont need to git up in de night,faulkner
33805,33806,i wont sleep mother says,you go on home,faulkner
33807,33808,i wont mind,we gwine take keer of her,faulkner
33809,33810,en you go on to bed too she says to me,you got to go to school tomorrow,faulkner
33811,33812,so i went out then mother called me back and cried on me a while,you are my only hope she says,faulkner
33813,33814,every night i thank god for you,while we were waiting there for them to start she says thank god if he had to be taken too it is you left me and not quentin,faulkner
33815,33816,thank god you are not a compson because all i have left now is you and maury and i says well i could spare uncle maury myself,well he kept on patting her hand with his black glove talking away from her,faulkner
33817,33818,he took them off when his turn with the shovel came,he got up near the first where they were holding the umbrellas over them stamping every now and then and trying to kick the mud off their feet and sticking to the shovels so they d have to knock it off making a hollow sound when it fell on it and when i stepped back around the hack i could see him behind a tombstone taking another one out of a bottle,faulkner
33819,33820,i thought he never was going to stop because i had on my new suit too but it happened that there was nt much mud on the wheels yet only mother saw it and says i dont know when you ll ever have another one and uncle maury says now now,dont you worry at all,faulkner
33821,33822,you have me to depend on always,and we have,faulkner
33823,33824,always,the fourth letter was from him,faulkner
33825,33826,but there was nt any need to open it,i could have written it myself or recited it to her from memory adding ten dollars just to be safe,faulkner
33827,33828,but i had a hunch about that other letter,i just felt that it was about time she was up to some of her tricks again,faulkner
33829,33830,she got pretty wise after that first time,she found out pretty quick that i was a different breed of cat from father,faulkner
33831,33832,when they begun to get it filled up toward the top mother started crying sure enough so uncle maury got in with her and drove off,he says you can come in with somebody they ll be glad to give you a lift,faulkner
33833,33834,i ll have to take your mother on and i thought about saying yes you ought to brought two bottles instead of just one only i thought about where we were so i let them go on,little they cared how wet i got because then mother could have a whale of a time being afraid i was taking pneumonia,faulkner
33835,33836,well i got to thinking about that and watching them throwing dirt into it slapping it on anyway like they were making mortar or something or building a fence and i began to feel sort of funny and so i decided to walk around a while,i thought that if i went toward town they d catch up and be trying to make me get in one of them so i went on back toward the nigger graveyard,faulkner
33837,33838,i got under some cedars where the rain did nt come much only dripping now and then where i could see when they got through and went away,after a while they were all gone and i waited a minute and came out,faulkner
33839,33840,i had to follow the path to keep out of the wet grass so i did nt see her until i was pretty near there standing there in a black cloak looking at the flowers,i knew who it was right off before she turned and looked at me and lifted up her veil,faulkner
33841,33842,hello jason she says holding out her hand,we shook hands,faulkner
33843,33844,what are you doing here,i says,faulkner
33845,33846,i thought you promised her you would nt come back here,i thought you had more sense than that,faulkner
33847,33848,yes,she says,faulkner
33849,33850,she looked at the flowers again,there must have been fifty dollars worth,faulkner
33851,33852,somebody had put one bunch on quentin s,you did,faulkner
33853,33854,she says,i m not surprised though i says,faulkner
33855,33856,i would nt put anything past you,you dont mind anybody,faulkner
33857,33858,you dont give a dam about anybody,oh she says that job,faulkner
33859,33860,she looked at the grave,i m sorry about that jason,faulkner
33861,33862,i bet you are i says,you ll talk mighty meek now,faulkner
33863,33864,but you need nt have come back,there s not anything left,faulkner
33865,33866,ask uncle maury if you dont believe me,i dont want anything she says,faulkner
33867,33868,she looked at the grave,why did nt they let me know,faulkner
33869,33870,she says,i just happened to see it in the paper,faulkner
33871,33872,on the back page,just happened to,faulkner
33873,33874,i did nt say anything,we stood there looking at the grave and then i got to thinking about when we were little and one thing and another and i got to feeling funny again kind of mad or something thinking about now we d have uncle maury around the house all the time running things like the way he left me to come home in the rain by myself,faulkner
33875,33876,but it wont do you any good,dont think that you can take advantage of this to come sneaking back,faulkner
33877,33878,if you cant stay on the horse you ve got you ll have to walk i says,we dont even know your name at that house i says,faulkner
33879,33880,do you know that,we dont even know your name,faulkner
33881,33882,you d be better off if you were down there with him and quentin i says,do you know that,faulkner
33883,33884,i know it she says,jason she says looking at the grave if you ll fix it so i can see her a minute i ll give you fifty dollars,faulkner
33885,33886,you have nt got fifty dollars i says,will you,faulkner
33887,33888,she says not looking at me,let s see it i says,faulkner
33889,33890,i dont believe you ve got fifty dollars,i could see where her hands were moving under her cloak then she held her hand out,faulkner
33891,33892,dam if it was nt full of money,i could see two or three yellow ones,faulkner
33893,33894,does he still give you money,i says,faulkner
33895,33896,how much does he send you,i ll give you a hundred she says,faulkner
33897,33898,will you,just a minute i says,faulkner
33899,33900,and just like i say,just like you say do it,faulkner
33901,33902,just so i see her a minute,i wont beg or do anything,faulkner
33903,33904,i ll go right on away,give me the money i says,faulkner
33905,33906,i ll give it to you afterward she says,dont you trust me,faulkner
33907,33908,i says,no she says,faulkner
33909,33910,i know you,i grew up with you,faulkner
33911,33912,you re a fine one to talk about trusting people i says,well i says,faulkner
33913,33914,i got to get on out of the rain,goodbye,faulkner
33915,33916,i made to go away,jason she says,faulkner
33917,33918,i stopped,yes,faulkner
33919,33920,i says,hurry up,faulkner
33921,33922,i m getting wet,all right she says,faulkner
33923,33924,here,there was nt anybody in sight,faulkner
33925,33926,i went back and took the money,she still held to it,faulkner
33927,33928,you ll do it,she says looking at me from under the veil,faulkner
33929,33930,you promise,let go i says,faulkner
33931,33932,you want somebody to come along and see us,she let go,faulkner
33933,33934,i put the money in my pocket,you ll do it jason,faulkner
33935,33936,she says,i would nt ask you if there was any other way,faulkner
33937,33938,you dam right there s no other way i says,sure i ll do it,faulkner
33939,33940,i said i would did nt i,only you ll have to do just like i say now,faulkner
33941,33942,yes she says,i will,faulkner
33943,33944,so i told her where to be and went to the livery stable,i hurried and got there just as they were unhitching the hack,faulkner
33945,33946,i asked if they had paid for it yet and he said no and i said mrs compson forgot something and wanted it again so they let me take it,mink was driving,faulkner
33947,33948,i bought him a cigar so we drove around until it begun to get dark on the back streets where they would nt see him,then mink said he d have to take the team on back and so i said i d buy him another cigar and so we drove into the lane and i went across the yard to the house,faulkner
33949,33950,i stopped in the hall until i could hear mother and uncle maury upstairs then i went on back to the kitchen,she and ben were there with dilsey,faulkner
33951,33952,i said mother wanted her and i took her into the house,i found uncle maury s raincoat and put it around her and picked her up and went back to the lane and got in the hack,faulkner
33953,33954,i told mink to drive to the depot,he was afraid to pass the stable so we had to go the back way and i saw her standing on the corner under the light and i told mink to drive close to the walk and when i said go on to give the team a bat,faulkner
33955,33956,then i took the raincoat off of her and held her to the window and caddy saw her and sort of jumped forward,hit em mink,faulkner
33957,33958,i says and mink gave them a cut and we went past her like a fire engine,now get on that train like you promised i says,faulkner
33959,33960,i could see her running after us through the back window,hit em again i says,faulkner
33961,33962,let s get on home,when we turned the corner she was still running,faulkner
33963,33964,and so i counted the money again that night and put it away and i did nt feel so bad,i says i reckon that ll show you,faulkner
33965,33966,i reckon you ll know now that you cant beat me out of a job and get away with it,it never occurred to me she would nt keep her promise and take that train,faulkner
33967,33968,but i did nt know much about them then i did nt have any more sense than to believe what they said because the next morning dam if she did nt walk right into the store only she had sense enough to wear the veil and not speak to anybody,it was saturday morning because i was at the store and she came right on back to the desk where i was walking fast,faulkner
33969,33970,liar she says,liar,faulkner
33971,33972,are you crazy,i says,faulkner
33973,33974,what do you mean,coming in here like this,faulkner
33975,33976,she started in but i shut her off,i says you already cost me one job do you want me to lose this one too,faulkner
33977,33978,if you ve got anything to say to me i ll meet you somewhere after dark,what have you got to say to me,faulkner
33979,33980,i says,did nt i do everything i said,faulkner
33981,33982,i said see her a minute did nt i,well did nt you,faulkner
33983,33984,she just stood there looking at me shaking like an aguefit her hands clenched and kind of jerking,i did just what i said i would i says,faulkner
33985,33986,you re the one that lied,you promised to take that train,faulkner
33987,33988,did nt you,did nt you promise,faulkner
33989,33990,if you think you can get that money back just try it i says,if it d been a thousand dollars you d still owe me after the risk i took,faulkner
33991,33992,and if i see or hear you re still in town after number runs i says i ll tell mother and uncle maury,then hold your breath until you see her again,faulkner
33993,33994,she just stood there looking at me twisting her hands together,damn you she says,faulkner
33995,33996,damn you,sure i says,faulkner
33997,33998,that s all right too,mind what i say now,faulkner
33999,34000,after number and i tell them,after she was gone i felt better,faulkner
34001,34002,i says i reckon you ll think twice before you deprive me of a job that was promised me,i was a kid then,faulkner
34003,34004,i believed folks when they said they d do things,i ve learned better since,faulkner
34005,34006,besides like i say i guess i dont need any man s help to get along i can stand on my own feet like i always have,then all of a sudden i thought of dilsey and uncle maury,faulkner
34007,34008,i thought how she d get around dilsey and that uncle maury would do anything for ten dollars,and there i was could nt even get away from the store to protect my own mother,faulkner
34009,34010,like she says if one of you had to be taken thank god it was you left me i can depend on you and i says well i dont reckon i ll ever get far enough from the store to get out of your reach,somebody s got to hold on to what little we have left i reckon,faulkner
34011,34012,so as soon as i got home i fixed dilsey,i told dilsey she had leprosy and i got the bible and read where a man s flesh rotted off and i told her that if she ever looked at her or ben or quentin they d catch it too,faulkner
34013,34014,so i thought i had everything all fixed until that day when i came home and found ben bellowing,raising hell and nobody could quiet him,faulkner
34015,34016,mother said well get him the slipper then,dilsey made out she did nt hear,faulkner
34017,34018,mother said it again and i says i d go i could nt stand that dam noise,like i say i can stand lots of things i dont expect much from them but if i have to work all day long in a dam store dam if i dont think i deserve a little peace and quiet to eat dinner in,faulkner
34019,34020,so i says i d go and dilsey says quick jason,well like a flash i knew what was up but just to make sure i went and got the slipper and brought it back and just like i thought when he saw it you d thought we were killing him,faulkner
34021,34022,so i made dilsey own up then i told mother,we had to take her up to bed then and after things got quieted down a little i put the fear of god into dilsey,faulkner
34023,34024,as much as you can into a nigger that is,that s the trouble with nigger servants when they ve been with you for a long time they get so full of self importance that they re not worth a dam,faulkner
34025,34026,think they run the whole family,i like to know whut s de hurt in lettin dat po chile see her own baby dilsey says,faulkner
34027,34028,if mr jason was still here hit ud be different,only mr jason s not here i says,faulkner
34029,34030,i know you wont pay me any mind but i reckon you ll do what mother says,you keep on worrying her like this until you get her into the graveyard too then you can fill the whole house full of ragtag and bobtail,faulkner
34031,34032,but what did you want to let that dam boy see her for,you s a cold man jason if man you is she says,faulkner
34033,34034,i thank de lawd i got mo heart den cat even ef hit is black,at least i m man enough to keep that flour barrel full i says,faulkner
34035,34036,and if you do that again you wont be eating out of it either,so the next time i told her that if she tried dilsey again mother was going to fire dilsey and send ben to jackson and take quentin and go away,faulkner
34037,34038,she looked at me for a while,there was nt any street light close and i could nt see her face much,faulkner
34039,34040,but i could feel her looking at me,when we were little when she d get mad and could nt do anything about it her upper lip would begin to jump,faulkner
34041,34042,everytime it jumped it would leave a little more of her teeth showing and all the time she d be as still as a post not a muscle moving except her lip jerking higher and higher up her teeth,but she did nt say anything,faulkner
34043,34044,how much,well if one look through a hack window was worth a hundred i says,faulkner
34045,34046,so after that she behaved pretty well only one time she asked to see a statement of the bank account,i know they have mother s indorsement on them she says,faulkner
34047,34048,but i want to see the bank statement,i want to see myself where those checks go,faulkner
34049,34050,that s in mother s private business i says,if you think you have any right to pry into her private affairs i ll tell her you believe those checks are being misappropriated and you want an audit because you dont trust her,faulkner
34051,34052,she did nt say anything or move,i could hear her whispering damn you oh damn you oh damn you,faulkner
34053,34054,say it out i says,i dont reckon it s any secret what you and i think of one another,faulkner
34055,34056,maybe you want the money back i says,listen jason she says,faulkner
34057,34058,dont lie to me now,about her,faulkner
34059,34060,i wont ask to see anything,if that is nt enough i ll send more each month,faulkner
34061,34062,just promise that she ll that she you can do that,things for her,faulkner
34063,34064,be kind to her,little things that i cant they wont let but you wont,faulkner
34065,34066,you never had a drop of warm blood in you,listen she says,faulkner
34067,34068,if you ll get mother to let me have her back i ll give you a thousand dollars,you have nt got a thousand dollars i says,faulkner
34069,34070,i know you re lying now,yes i have,faulkner
34071,34072,i will have,i can get it,faulkner
34073,34074,and i know how you ll get it i says,you ll get it the same way you got her,faulkner
34075,34076,and when she gets big enough then i thought she really was going to hit at me and then i did nt know what she was going to do,she acted for a minute like some kind of a toy that s wound up too tight and about to burst all to pieces,faulkner
34077,34078,oh i m crazy she says,i m insane,faulkner
34079,34080,i cant take her,keep her,faulkner
34081,34082,what am i thinking of,jason she says grabbing my arm,faulkner
34083,34084,her hands were hot as fever,you ll have to promise to take care of her to she s kin to you your own flesh and blood,faulkner
34085,34086,promise jason,you have father s name do you think i d have to ask him twice,faulkner
34087,34088,once even,that s so i says,faulkner
34089,34090,he did leave me something,what do you want me to do i says,faulkner
34091,34092,buy an apron and a gocart,i never got you into this i says,faulkner
34093,34094,i run more risk than you do because you have nt got anything at stake,no,faulkner
34095,34096,i have nothing at stake she says making that noise putting her hands to her mouth,nuhnuhnothing she says,faulkner
34097,34098,here i says,stop that,faulkner
34099,34100,i m trtrying to she says holding her hands over her mouth,oh god oh god,faulkner
34101,34102,i m going away from here i says,i cant be seen here,faulkner
34103,34104,you get on out of town now you hear,wait she says catching my arm,faulkner
34105,34106,i ve stopped,i wont again,faulkner
34107,34108,you promise jason,she says and me feeling her eyes almost like they were touching my face,faulkner
34109,34110,you promise,mother that money if sometimes she needs things if i send checks for her to you other ones besides those you ll give them to her,faulkner
34111,34112,you wont tell,you ll see that she has things like other girls,faulkner
34113,34114,sure i says,as long as you behave and do like i tell you,faulkner
34115,34116,and so when earl came up front with his hat on he says i m going to step up to rogers and get a snack,we wont have time to go home to dinner i reckon,faulkner
34117,34118,what s the matter we wont have time,i says,faulkner
34119,34120,with this show in town and all he says,they re going to give an afternoon performance too and they ll all want to get done trading in time to go to it,faulkner
34121,34122,so we d better just run up to rogers,all right i says,faulkner
34123,34124,it s your stomach,if you want to make a slave of yourself to your business it s all right with me,faulkner
34125,34126,i reckon you ll never be a slave to any business he says,not unless it s jason compson s business i says,faulkner
34127,34128,so when i went back and opened it the only thing that surprised me was it was a money order not a check,yes sir,faulkner
34129,34130,you cant trust a one of them,after all the risk i d taken risking mother finding out about her coming down here once or twice a year sometimes and me having to tell mother lies about it,faulkner
34131,34132,that s gratitude for you,and i would nt put it past her to try to notify the postoffice not to let anyone except her cash it,faulkner
34133,34134,giving a kid like that fifty dollars,why i never saw fifty dollars until i was twentyone years old with all the other boys with the afternoon off and all day saturday and me working in a store,faulkner
34135,34136,like i say how can they expect anybody to control her with her giving her money behind our backs,she has the same home you had i says and the same raising,faulkner
34137,34138,i reckon mother is a better judge of what she needs than you are that have nt even got a home,if you want to give her money i says you send it to mother dont be giving it to her,faulkner
34139,34140,if i ve got to run this risk every few months you ll have to do like i say or it s out,and just about the time i got ready to begin on it because if earl thought i was going to dash up the street and gobble two bits worth of indigestion on his account he was bad fooled,faulkner
34141,34142,i may not be sitting with my feet on a mahogany desk but i am being payed for what i do inside this building and if i cant manage to live a civilised life outside of it i ll go where i can,i can stand on my own feet i dont need any man s mahogany desk to prop me up,faulkner
34143,34144,so just about the time i got ready to start i d have to drop everything and run to sell some redneck a dime s worth of nails or something and earl up there gobbling a sandwich and half way back already like as not and then i found that all the blanks were gone,i remembered then that i had aimed to get some more but it was too late now and then i looked up and there she came,faulkner
34145,34146,in the back door,i heard her asking old job if i was there,faulkner
34147,34148,i just had time to stick them in the drawer and close it,she came around to the desk,faulkner
34149,34150,i looked at my watch,you been to dinner already,faulkner
34151,34152,i says,it s just twelve i just heard it strike,faulkner
34153,34154,you must have flown home and back,i m not going home to dinner she says,faulkner
34155,34156,did i get a letter today,were you expecting one,faulkner
34157,34158,i says,have you got a sweetie that can write,faulkner
34159,34160,from mother she says,did i get a letter from mother,faulkner
34161,34162,she says looking at me,mother got one from her i says,faulkner
34163,34164,i have nt opened it,you ll have to wait until she opens it,faulkner
34165,34166,she ll let you see it i imagine,please jason she says not paying any attention,faulkner
34167,34168,did i get one,what s the matter,faulkner
34169,34170,i says,i never knew you to be this anxious about anybody,faulkner
34171,34172,you must expect some money from her,she said she she says,faulkner
34173,34174,please jason she says,did i,faulkner
34175,34176,you must have been to school today after all i says,somewhere where they taught you to say please,faulkner
34177,34178,wait a minute while i wait on that customer,i went and waited on him,faulkner
34179,34180,when i turned to come back she was out of sight behind the desk,i ran,faulkner
34181,34182,i ran around the desk and caught her as she jerked her hand out of the drawer,i took the letter away from her beating her knuckles on the desk until she let go,faulkner
34183,34184,you would would you,i says,faulkner
34185,34186,give it to me she says,you ve already opened it,faulkner
34187,34188,give it to me,please jason,faulkner
34189,34190,it s mine,i saw the name,faulkner
34191,34192,i ll take a hame string to you i says,that s what i ll give you,faulkner
34193,34194,going into my papers,is there some money in it,faulkner
34195,34196,she says reaching for it,she said she would send me some money,faulkner
34197,34198,she promised she would,give it to me,faulkner
34199,34200,what do you want with money,i says,faulkner
34201,34202,she said she would she says,give it to me,faulkner
34203,34204,please jason,i wont ever ask you anything again if you ll give it to me this time,faulkner
34205,34206,i m going to if you ll give me time i says,i took the letter and the money order out and gave her the letter,faulkner
34207,34208,she reached for the money order not hardly glancing at the letter,you ll have to sign it first i says,faulkner
34209,34210,how much is it,she says,faulkner
34211,34212,read the letter i says,i reckon it ll say,faulkner
34213,34214,she read it fast in about two looks,it dont say she says looking up,faulkner
34215,34216,she dropped the letter to the floor,how much is it,faulkner
34217,34218,it s ten dollars i says,ten dollars,faulkner
34219,34220,she says staring at me,and you ought to be dam glad to get that i says,faulkner
34221,34222,a kid like you,what are you in such a rush for money all of a sudden for,faulkner
34223,34224,ten dollars,she says like she was talking in her sleep,faulkner
34225,34226,just ten dollars,she made a grab at the money order,faulkner
34227,34228,you re lying she says,thief,faulkner
34229,34230,she says,thief,faulkner
34231,34232,you would would you,i says holding her off,faulkner

34267,34268,i says,you need nt bother to tell me that,faulkner
34269,34270,if you can find anybody in this town that ll charge anything to you after what i told them i ll eat it,it s a girl she says,faulkner

34289,34290,she said she sends money here and you say she dont send any,she said she s sent a lot of money here,faulkner
34291,34292,she says it s for me,that it s for me to have some of it,faulkner
34293,34294,and you say we have nt got any money,you know as much about that as i do i says,faulkner
34295,34296,you ve seen what happens to those checks,yes she says looking at the floor,faulkner

34311,34312,you sign your name on that line,she took the pen but instead of signing it she just stood there with her head bent and the pen shaking in her hand,faulkner
34313,34314,just like her mother,oh god she says oh god,faulkner
34315,34316,yes i says,that s one thing you ll have to learn if you never learn anything else,faulkner
34317,34318,sign it now and get on out of here,she signed it,faulkner
34319,34320,where s the money,she says,faulkner
34321,34322,i took the order and blotted it and put it in my pocket,then i gave her the ten dollars,faulkner
34323,34324,now you go on back to school this afternoon you hear,i says,faulkner
34325,34326,she did nt answer,she crumpled the bill up in her hand like it was a rag or something and went on out the front door just as earl came in,faulkner
34327,34328,a customer came in with him and they stopped up front,i gathered up the things and put on my hat and went up front,faulkner
34329,34330,been much busy,earl says,faulkner
34331,34332,not much i says,he looked out the door,faulkner
34333,34334,that your car over yonder,he says,faulkner
34335,34336,better not try to go out home to dinner,we ll likely have another rush just before the show opens,faulkner
34337,34338,get you a lunch at rogers and put a ticket in the drawer,much obliged i says,faulkner
34339,34340,i can still manage to feed myself i reckon,and right there he d stay watching that door like a hawk until i came through it again,faulkner
34341,34342,well he d just have to watch it for a while i was doing the best i could,the time before i says that s the last one now you ll have to remember to get some more right away,faulkner
34343,34344,but who can remember anything in all this hurrah,and now this dam show had to come here the one day i d have to hunt all over town for a blank check besides all the other things i had to do to keep the house running and earl watching the door like a hawk,faulkner
34345,34346,i went to the printing shop and told him i wanted to play a joke on a fellow but he did nt have anything,then he told me to have a look in the old opera house where somebody had stored a lot of papers and junk out of the old merchants and farmers bank when it failed so i dodged up a few more alleys so earl could nt see me and finally found old man simmons and got the key from him and went up there and dug around,faulkner
34347,34348,at last i found a pad on a saint louis bank,and of course she d pick this one time to look at it close,faulkner
34349,34350,well it would have to do,i could nt waste any more time now,faulkner
34351,34352,i went back to the store,forgot some papers mother wants to go to the bank i says,faulkner
34353,34354,i went back to the desk and fixed the check,trying to hurry and all i says to myself it s a good thing her eyes are giving out with that little whore in the house a christian forbearing woman like mother,faulkner
34355,34356,i says you know just as well as i do what she s going to grow up into but i says that s your business if you want to keep her and raise her in your house just because of father,then she would begin to cry and say it was her own flesh and blood so i just says all right,faulkner
34357,34358,have it your way,i can stand it if you can,faulkner
34359,34360,i fixed the letter up again and glued it back and went out,try not to be gone any longer than you can help earl says,faulkner
34361,34362,all right i says,i went to the telegraph office,faulkner
34363,34364,the smart boys were all there,any of you boys made your million yet,faulkner
34365,34366,i says,who can do anything with a market like that,faulkner
34367,34368,doc says,what s it doing,faulkner
34369,34370,i says,i went in and looked,faulkner
34371,34372,it was three points under the opening,you boys are not going to let a little thing like the cotton market beat you are you,faulkner
34373,34374,i says,i thought you were too smart for that,faulkner
34375,34376,smart hell doc says,it was down twelve points at twelve oclock,faulkner
34377,34378,cleaned me out,twelve points,faulkner
34379,34380,i says,why the hell did nt somebody let me know,faulkner
34381,34382,why did nt you let me know,i says to the operator,faulkner
34383,34384,i take it as it comes in he says,i m not running a bucket shop,faulkner
34385,34386,you re smart are nt you,i says,faulkner
34387,34388,seems to me with the money i spend with you you could take time to call me up,or maybe your dam company s in a conspiracy with those dam eastern sharks,faulkner
34389,34390,he did nt say anything,he made like he was busy,faulkner
34391,34392,you re getting a little too big for your pants i says,first thing you know you ll be working for a living,faulkner
34393,34394,what s the matter with you,doc says,faulkner
34395,34396,you re still three points to the good,yes i says,faulkner
34397,34398,if i happened to be selling,i have nt mentioned that yet i think,faulkner
34399,34400,you boys all cleaned out,i got caught twice doc says,faulkner
34401,34402,i switched just in time,well i o snopes says,faulkner
34403,34404,i ve picked hit i reckon taint no more than fair fer hit to pick me once in a while,so i left them buying and selling among themselves at a nickel a point,faulkner
34405,34406,i found a nigger and sent him for my car and stood on the corner and waited,i could nt see earl looking up and down the street with one eye on the clock because i could nt see the door from here,faulkner
34407,34408,after about a week he got back with it,where the hell have you been,faulkner
34409,34410,i says,riding around where the wenches could see you,faulkner
34411,34412,i come straight as i could he says,i had to drive clean around the square wid all dem wagons,faulkner
34413,34414,i never found a nigger yet that did nt have an airtight alibi for whatever he did,but just turn one loose in a car and he s bound to show off,faulkner
34415,34416,i got in and went on around the square,i caught a glimpse of earl in the door across the square,faulkner
34417,34418,i went straight to the kitchen and told dilsey to hurry up with dinner,quentin aint come yit she says,faulkner
34419,34420,what of that,i says,faulkner
34421,34422,you ll be telling me next that luster s not quite ready to eat yet,quentin knows when meals are served in this house,faulkner
34423,34424,hurry up with it now,mother was in her room,faulkner
34425,34426,i gave her the letter,she opened it and took the check out and sat holding it in her hand,faulkner
34427,34428,i went and got the shovel from the corner and gave her a match,come on i says,faulkner
34429,34430,get it over with,you ll be crying in a minute,faulkner
34431,34432,she took the match but she did nt strike it,she sat there looking at the check,faulkner
34433,34434,just like i said it would be,i hate to do it she says,faulkner
34435,34436,come on,get it over with,faulkner
34437,34438,but she just sat there holding the check,this one is on a different bank she says,faulkner
34439,34440,they have been on an indianapolis bank,yes i says,faulkner
34441,34442,women are allowed to do that too,do what,faulkner
34443,34444,she says,keep money in two different banks i says,faulkner
34445,34446,oh she says,she looked at the check a while,faulkner
34447,34448,i m glad to know she s so she has so much god sees that i am doing right she says,come on i says,faulkner
34449,34450,finish it,get the fun over,faulkner
34451,34452,fun,she says,faulkner
34453,34454,come on now,want me to strike the match,faulkner
34455,34456,i could bring myself to accept them she says,for my children s sake,faulkner
34457,34458,i have no pride,you d never be satisfied i says,faulkner
34459,34460,you know you would nt,you ve settled that once let it stay settled,faulkner
34461,34462,we can get along,i leave everything to you she says,faulkner
34463,34464,but sometimes i become afraid that in doing this i am depriving you all of what is rightfully yours,perhaps i shall be punished for it,faulkner
34465,34466,if you want me to i will smother my pride and accept them,what would be the good in beginning now when you ve been destroying them for fifteen years,faulkner
34467,34468,i says,if you keep on doing it you have lost nothing but if you d begin to take them now you ll have lost fifty thousand dollars,faulkner
34469,34470,we ve got along so far have nt we,i says,faulkner
34471,34472,i have nt seen you in the poorhouse yet,yes she says,faulkner
34473,34474,we bascombs need nobody s charity,certainly not that of a fallen woman,faulkner
34475,34476,she struck the match and lit the check and put it in the shovel and then the envelope and watched them burn,you dont know what it is she says,faulkner
34477,34478,thank god you will never know what a mother feels,there are lots of women in this world no better than her i says,faulkner
34479,34480,but they are not my daughters she says,it s not myself she says,faulkner
34481,34482,i d gladly take her back sins and all because she is my flesh and blood,it s for quentin s sake,faulkner
34483,34484,well i could have said it was nt much chance of anybody hurting quentin much but like i say i dont expect much but i do want to eat and sleep without a couple of women squabbling and crying in the house,and yours she says,faulkner
34485,34486,i know how you feel toward her,let her come back i says far as i m concerned,faulkner
34487,34488,no she says,i owe that to your father s memory,faulkner
34489,34490,when he was trying all the time to persuade you to let her come home when herbert threw her out,i says,faulkner
34491,34492,you dont understand she says,i know you dont intend to make it more difficult for me,faulkner
34493,34494,but it s my place to suffer for my children she says,i can bear it,faulkner
34495,34496,seems to me you go to a lot of unnecessary trouble doing it i says,the paper burned out,faulkner
34497,34498,i carried it to the grate and put it in,it just seems a shame to me to burn up good money i says,faulkner
34499,34500,let me never see the day when my children will have to accept that the wages of sin she says,i d rather see even you dead in your coffin first,faulkner
34501,34502,have it your way i says,are we going to have dinner soon,faulkner
34503,34504,i says,because if we re not i ll have to go on back,faulkner
34505,34506,we re pretty busy today,she got up,faulkner
34507,34508,i ve told her once i says,it seems she s waiting on quentin or luster or somebody,faulkner
34509,34510,here i ll call her,wait,faulkner
34511,34512,but she went to the head of the stairs and called,quentin aint come yit dilsey says,faulkner
34513,34514,well i ll have to get on back i says,i can get a sandwich downtown,faulkner
34515,34516,i dont want to interfere with dilsey s arrangements i says,i try to please you all mother says,faulkner
34517,34518,i try to make things as easy for you as i can,i m not complaining am i,faulkner
34519,34520,i says,have i said a word except i had to go back to work,faulkner
34521,34522,i know she says,i know you have nt had the chance the others had that you ve had to bury yourself in a little country store,faulkner
34523,34524,i wanted you to get ahead,he may not have even had a bank,faulkner
34525,34526,and if he had i dont reckon he d have to come all the way to mississippi to get a man for it,we ate a while,faulkner
34527,34528,i could hear ben in the kitchen where luster was feeding him,like i say if we ve got to feed another mouth and she wont take that money why not send him down to jackson,faulkner
34529,34530,he ll be happier there with people like him,i says god knows there s little enough room for pride in this family but it dont take much pride to not like to see a thirty year old man playing around the yard with a nigger boy running up and down the fence and lowing like a cow whenever they play golf over there,faulkner
34531,34532,i says if they d sent him to jackson at first we d all be better off today,i says you ve done your duty by him you ve done all anybody can expect of you and more than most folks would do so why not send him there and get that much benefit out of the taxes we pay,faulkner
34533,34534,then she says i ll be gone soon,i know i m just a burden to you and i says you ve been saying that so long that i m beginning to believe you only i says you d better be sure and not let me know you re gone because i ll sure have him on number seventeen that night and i says i think i know a place where they ll take her too and the name of it s not milk street and honey avenue either,faulkner
34535,34536,then she begun to cry and i says all right all right i have as much pride about my kinfolks as anybody even if i dont always know where they come from,we ate for a while,faulkner
34537,34538,mother sent dilsey to the front to look for quentin again,i keep telling you she s not coming to dinner i says,faulkner
34539,34540,she knows better than that mother says,she knows i dont permit her to run about the streets and not come home at meal time,faulkner
34541,34542,did you look good dilsey,dont let her then i says,faulkner
34543,34544,what can i do she says,you have all of you flouted me,faulkner
34545,34546,always,if you would nt come interfering i d make her mind i says,faulkner
34547,34548,it would nt take me but about one day to straighten her out,you d be too brutal with her she says,faulkner
34549,34550,you have your uncle maury s temper,that reminded me of the letter,faulkner
34551,34552,i took it out and handed it to her,you wont have to open it i says,faulkner
34553,34554,the bank will let you know how much it is this time,it s addressed to you she says,faulkner
34555,34556,go on and open it i says,my business experience has taught me to be chary of committing anything of a confidential nature to any more concrete medium than speech and my extreme precaution in this instance should give you some inkling of its value,faulkner
34557,34558,needless to say i have just completed a most exhaustive examination of all its phases and i feel no hesitancy in telling you that it is that sort of golden chance that comes but once in a lifetime and i now see clearly before me that goal toward which i have long and unflaggingly striven ie the ultimate solidification of my affairs by which i may restore to its rightful position that family of which i have the honor to be the sole remaining male descendant that family in which i have ever included your lady mother and her children,as it so happens i am not quite in a position to avail myself of this opportunity to the uttermost which it warrants but rather than go out of the family to do so i am today drawing upon your mother s bank for the small sum necessary to complement my own initial investment for which i herewith enclose as a matter of formality my note of hand at eight percent,faulkner
34559,34560,per annum,needless to say this is merely a formality to secure your mother in the event of that circumstance of which man is ever the plaything and sport,faulkner
34561,34562,for naturally i shall employ this sum as though it were my own and so permit your mother to avail herself of this opportunity which my exhaustive investigation has shown to be a bonanza if you will permit the vulgarism of the first water and purest ray serene,this is in confidence you will understand from one business man to another we will harvest our own vineyards eh,faulkner
34563,34564,and knowing your mother s delicate health and that timorousness which such delicately nurtured southern ladies would naturally feel regarding matters of business and their charming proneness to divulge unwittingly such matters in conversation i would suggest that you do not mention it to her at all,on second thought i advise you not to do so,faulkner
34565,34566,it might be better to simply restore this sum to the bank at some future date say in a lump sum with the other small sums for which i am indebted to her and say nothing about it at all,it is our duty to shield her from the crass material world as much as possible,faulkner
34567,34568,your affectionate uncle maury l,bascomb,faulkner
34569,34570,i says flipping it across the table,i know you grudge what i give him she says,faulkner
34571,34572,it s your money i says,if you want to throw it to the birds even it s your business,faulkner
34573,34574,he s my own brother mother says,he s the last bascomb,faulkner
34575,34576,when we are gone there wont be any more of them,that ll be hard on somebody i guess i says,faulkner
34577,34578,all right all right i says,it s your money,faulkner
34579,34580,do as you please with it,you want me to tell the bank to pay it,faulkner
34581,34582,i know you begrudge him she says,i realise the burden on your shoulders,faulkner
34583,34584,when i m gone it will be easier on you,i could make it easier right now i says,faulkner
34585,34586,all right all right i wont mention it again,move all bedlam in here if you want to,faulkner
34587,34588,he s your own brother she says,even if he is afflicted,faulkner
34589,34590,i ll take your bank book i says,i ll draw my check today,faulkner
34591,34592,he kept you waiting six days she says,are you sure the business is sound,faulkner
34593,34594,it seems strange to me that a solvent business can not pay its employees promptly,he s all right i says,faulkner
34595,34596,safe as a bank,i tell him not to bother about mine until we get done collecting every month,faulkner
34597,34598,that s why it s late sometimes,i just could nt bear to have you lose the little i had to invest for you she says,faulkner
34599,34600,i ve often thought that earl is not a good business man,i know he does nt take you into his confidence to the extent that your investment in the business should warrant,faulkner
34601,34602,i m going to speak to him,no you let him alone i says,faulkner
34603,34604,it s his business,you have a thousand dollars in it,faulkner
34605,34606,you let him alone i says,i m watching things,faulkner
34607,34608,i have your power of attorney,it ll be all right,faulkner
34609,34610,you dont know what a comfort you are to me she says,you have always been my pride and joy but when you came to me of your own accord and insisted on banking your salary each month in my name i thanked god it was you left me if they had to be taken,faulkner
34611,34612,they were all right i says,they did the best they could i reckon,faulkner
34613,34614,when you talk that way i know you are thinking bitterly of your father s memory she says,you have a right to i suppose,faulkner
34615,34616,but it breaks my heart to hear you,i got up,faulkner
34617,34618,if you ve got any crying to do i says you ll have to do it alone because i ve got to get on back,i ll get the bank book,faulkner
34619,34620,i ll get it she says,keep still i says,faulkner
34621,34622,i ll get it,i went up stairs and got the bank book out of her desk and went back to town,faulkner
34623,34624,i went to the bank and deposited the check and the money order and the other ten and stopped at the telegraph office,it was one point above the opening,faulkner
34625,34626,i had already lost thirteen points all because she had to come helling in there at twelve worrying me about that letter,what time did that report come in,faulkner
34627,34628,i says,about an hour ago he says,faulkner
34629,34630,an hour ago,i says,faulkner
34631,34632,what are we paying you for,i says,faulkner
34633,34634,weekly reports,how do you expect a man to do anything,faulkner
34635,34636,the whole dam top could blow off and we d not know it,i dont expect you to do anything he says,faulkner
34637,34638,they changed that law making folks play the cotton market,they have,faulkner
34639,34640,i says,i had nt heard,faulkner
34641,34642,they must have sent the news out over the western union,i went back to the store,faulkner
34643,34644,thirteen points,dam if i believe anybody knows anything about the dam thing except the ones that sit back in those new york offices and watch the country suckers come up and beg them to take their money,faulkner
34645,34646,well a man that just calls shows he has no faith in himself and like i say if you are nt going to take the advice what s the use in paying money for it,besides these people are right up there on the ground they know everything that s going on,faulkner
34647,34648,i could feel the telegram in my pocket,i d just have to prove that they were using the telegraph company to defraud,faulkner
34649,34650,that would constitute a bucket shop,and i would nt hesitate that long either,faulkner
34651,34652,only be damned if it does nt look like a company as big and rich as the western union could get a market report out on time,half as quick as they ll get a wire to you saying your account closed out,faulkner
34653,34654,but what the hell do they care about the people,they re hand in glove with that new york crowd,faulkner
34655,34656,anybody could see that,when i came in earl looked at his watch,faulkner
34657,34658,but he did nt say anything until the customer was gone,i had to go to the dentist i says because it s not any of his business where i eat but i ve got to be in the store with him all the afternoon,faulkner
34659,34660,and with his jaw running off after all i ve stood,you take a little two by four country storekeeper like i say it takes a man with just five hundred dollars to worry about it fifty thousand dollars worth,faulkner
34661,34662,you might have told me he says,i expected you back right away,faulkner
34663,34664,i ll trade you this tooth and give you ten dollars to boot any time i says,our agreement was an hour for dinner i says and if you dont like the way i do you know what you can do about it,faulkner
34665,34666,i ve known that some time he says,if it had nt been for your mother i d have done it before now too,faulkner
34667,34668,she s a lady i ve got a lot of sympathy for jason,too bad some other folks i know cant say as much,faulkner
34669,34670,then you can keep it i says,when we need any sympathy i ll let you know in plenty of time,faulkner
34671,34672,i ve protected you about that business a long time jason he says,yes,faulkner
34673,34674,i says letting him go on,listening to what he would say before i shut him up,faulkner
34675,34676,i believe i know more about where that automobile came from than she does,you think so do you,faulkner
34677,34678,i says,when are you going to spread the news that i stole it from my mother,faulkner
34679,34680,i dont say anything he says,i know you have her power of attorney,faulkner
34681,34682,and i know she still believes that thousand dollars is in this business,all right i says,faulkner
34683,34684,since you know so much i ll tell you a little more go to the bank and ask them whose account i ve been depositing a hundred and sixty dollars on the first of every month for twelve years,i dont say anything he says,faulkner
34685,34686,i just ask you to be a little more careful after this,i never said anything more,faulkner
34687,34688,it does nt do any good,i ve found that when a man gets into a rut the best thing you can do is let him stay there,faulkner
34689,34690,and when a man gets it in his head that he s got to tell something on you for your own good goodnight,i m glad i have nt got the sort of conscience i ve got to nurse like a sick puppy all the time,faulkner
34691,34692,if i d ever be as careful over anything as he is to keep his little shirt tail full of business from making him more than eight percent,i reckon he thinks they d get him on the usury law if he netted more than eight percent,faulkner
34693,34694,what the hell chance has a man got tied down in a town like this and to a business like this,why i could take his business in one year and fix him so he d never have to work again only he d give it all away to the church or something,faulkner
34695,34696,if there s one thing gets under my skin it s a dam hypocrite,a man that thinks anything he dont understand all about must be crooked and that first chance he gets he s morally bound to tell the third party what s none of his business to tell,faulkner
34697,34698,like i say if i thought every time a man did something i did nt know all about he was bound to be a crook i reckon i would nt have any trouble finding something back there on those books that you would nt see any use for running and telling somebody i thought ought to know about it when for all i knew they might know a dam sight more about it now than i did and if they did nt it was dam little of my business anyway and he says my books are open to anybody,anybody that has any claim or believes she has any claim on this business can go back there and welcome,faulkner
34699,34700,sure you wont tell i says,you could nt square your conscience with that,faulkner
34701,34702,you ll just take her back there and let her find it,you wont tell yourself,faulkner
34703,34704,i m not trying to meddle in your business he says,i know you missed out on some things like quentin had,faulkner
34705,34706,but your mother has had a misfortunate life too and if she was to come in here and ask me why you quit i d have to tell her,it aint that thousand dollars,faulkner
34707,34708,you know that,it s because a man never gets anywhere if fact and his ledgers dont square,faulkner
34709,34710,and i m not going to lie to anybody for myself or anybody else,well then i says,faulkner
34711,34712,i reckon that conscience of yours is a more valuable clerk than i am it dont have to go home at noon to eat,only dont let it interfere with my appetite i says because how the hell can i do anything right with that dam family and her not making any effort to control her nor any of them like that time when she happened to see one of them kissing caddy and all next day she went around the house in a black dress and a veil and even father could nt get her to say a word except crying and saying her little daughter was dead and caddy about fifteen then only in three years she d been wearing haircloth or probably sandpaper at that rate,faulkner
34713,34714,do you think i can afford to have her running about the streets with every drummer that comes to town i says and them telling the new ones up and down the toad where to pick up a hot one when they made jefferson,i have nt got much pride i cant afford it with a kitchen full of niggers to feed and robbing the state asylum of its star freshman,faulkner
34715,34716,blood i says governors and generals,it s a dam good thing we never had any kings and presidents we d all be down there at jackson chasing butterflies,faulkner
34717,34718,i says it d be bad enough if it was mine i d at least be sure it was a bastard to begin with and now even the lord does nt know that for certain probably,so after a while i heard the band start up and then they begun to clear out,faulkner
34719,34720,headed for the show every one of them,haggling over a twenty cent hame string to save fifteen cents so they can give it to a bunch of yankees that come in and pay maybe ten dollars for the privilege,faulkner
34721,34722,i went on out to the back,well i says,faulkner
34723,34724,if you dont look out that bolt will grow into your hand,and then i m going to take an axe and chop it out,faulkner
34725,34726,what do you reckon the bollweevils ll eat if you dont get those cultivators in shape to raise them a crop,i says sage grass,faulkner
34727,34728,dem folks sho do play dem horns he says,tell me man in dat show kin play a tune on a handsaw,faulkner
34729,34730,pick hit like a banjo,listen i says,faulkner
34731,34732,do you know how much that show ll spend in this town,about ten dollars i says,faulkner
34733,34734,the ten dollars buck turpin has in his pocket right now,whut dey give mr buck ten dollars fer,faulkner
34735,34736,he says,for the privilege of showing here i says,faulkner
34737,34738,you can put the balance of what they ll spend in your eye,you mean dey pays ten dollars jest to give dey show here,faulkner
34739,34740,he says,that s all i says,faulkner
34741,34742,you mean to tell me dey chargin um to let um show here,i d pay ten dollars to see dat man pick dat saw ef i had to,faulkner
34743,34744,i figures dat tomorrow mawnin i be still owin um nine dollars and six bits at dat rate,and then a yankee will talk your head off about niggers getting ahead,faulkner
34745,34746,get them ahead what i say,get them so far ahead you cant find one south of louisville with a blood hound,faulkner
34747,34748,i kin sho afford my two bits,two bits hell i says,faulkner
34749,34750,that dont begin it,how about the dime or fifteen cents you ll spend for a dam two cent box of candy or something,faulkner
34751,34752,how about the time you re wasting right now listening to that band,dat s de troof he says,faulkner
34753,34754,well he says,i dont spute dat neither,faulkner
34755,34756,ef dat uz a crime all chaingangs would nt be black,well just about that time i happened to look up the alley and saw her,faulkner
34757,34758,when i stepped back and looked at my watch i did nt notice at the time who he was because i was looking at the watch,it was just two thirty fortyfive minutes before anybody but me expected her to be out,faulkner
34759,34760,so when i looked around the door the first thing i saw was the red tie he had on and i was thinking what the hell kind of a man would wear a red tie,but she was sneaking along the alley watching the door so i was nt thinking anything about him until they had gone past,faulkner
34761,34762,i was wondering if she d have so little respect for me that she d not only play out of school when i told her not to but would walk right past the store daring me not to see her,only she could nt see into the door because the sun fell straight into it and it was like trying to see through an automobile searchlight so i stood there and watched her go on past with her face painted up like a dam clown s and her hair all gummed and twisted and a dress that if a woman had come out doors even on gayoso or beale street when i was a young fellow with no more than that to cover her legs and behind she d been thrown in jail,faulkner
34763,34764,i ll be damned if they dont dress like they were trying to make every man they passed on the street want to reach out and clap his hand on it,and so i was thinking what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie when all of a sudden i knew he was one of those show folks well as if she d told me,faulkner
34765,34766,well i can stand a lot if i could nt dam if i would nt be in a hell of a fix so when they turned the corner i jumped down and followed,me without any hat in the middle of the afternoon having to chase up and down back alleys because of my mother s good name,faulkner
34767,34768,like i say you cant do anything with a woman like that if she s got it in her,if it s in her blood you cant do anything with her,faulkner
34769,34770,the only thing you can do is to get rid of her let her go on and live with her own sort,i went on to the street but they were out of sight,faulkner
34771,34772,and there i was without any hat looking like i was crazy too,like a man would naturally think one of them is crazy and another one drowned himself and the other one was turned out into the street by her husband what s the reason the rest of them are not crazy too,faulkner
34773,34774,all the time i could see them watching me like a hawk waiting for a chance to say well i m not surprised i expected it all the time the whole family s crazy,selling land to send him to harvard and paying taxes to support a state university all the time that i never saw except twice at a baseball game and not letting her daughter s name be spoken on the place until after a while father would nt even come down town anymore but just sat there all day with the decanter i could see the bottom of his nightshirt and his bare legs and hear the decanter clinking until finally tp,faulkner
34775,34776,had to pour it for him and she says you have no respect for your father s memory and i says i dont know why not it sure is preserved well enough to last only if i m crazy too god knows what i ll do about it just to look at water makes me sick and i d just as soon swallow gasoline as a glass of whiskey and lorraine telling them he may not drink but if you dont believe he s a man i can tell you how to find out she says if i catch you fooling with any of these whores you know what i ll do she says i ll whip her grabbing at her i ll whip her as long as i can find her she says and i says if i dont drink that s my business but have you ever found me short i says i ll buy you enough beer to take a bath in if you want it because i ve got every respect for a good honest whore because with mother s health and the position i try to uphold to have her with no more respect for what i try to do for her than to make her name and my name and my mother s name a byword in the town,she had dodged out of sight somewhere,faulkner
34777,34778,saw me coming and dodged into another alley running up and down the alleys with a dam show man in a red tie that everybody would look at and think what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie,well the boy kept speaking to me and so i took the telegram without knowing i had taken it,faulkner
34779,34780,i did nt realise what it was until i was signing for it and i tore it open without even caring much what it was,i knew all the time what it would be i reckon,faulkner
34781,34782,that was the only thing else that could happen especially holding it up until i had already had the check entered on the pass book,i dont see how a city no bigger than new york can hold enough people to take the money away from us country suckers,faulkner
34783,34784,work like hell all day every day send them your money and get a little piece of paper back your account closed at,teasing you along letting you pile up a little paper profit then banal your account closed at,faulkner
34785,34786,and if that was nt enough paying ten dollars a month to somebody to tell you how to lose it fast that either dont know anything about it or is in cahoots with the telegraph company,well i m done with them,faulkner
34787,34788,they ve sucked me in for the last time,any fool except a fellow that has nt got any more sense than to take a jew s word for anything could tell the market was going up all the time with the whole dam delta about to be flooded again and the cotton washed right out of the ground like it was last year,faulkner
34789,34790,let it wash a man s crop out of the ground year after year and them up there in washington spending fifty thousand dollars a day keeping an army in nicarauga or some place,of course it ll overflow again and then cotton ll be worth thirty cents a pound,faulkner
34791,34792,well i just want to hit them one time and get my money back,i dont want a killing only these small town gamblers are out for that i just want my money back that these dam jews have gotten with all their guaranteed inside dope,faulkner
34793,34794,then i m through they can kiss my foot for every other red cent of mine they get,i went back to the store,faulkner
34795,34796,it was half past three almost,dam little time to do anything in but then i am used to that,faulkner
34797,34798,i never had to go to harvard to learn that,the band had quit playing,faulkner
34799,34800,got them all inside now and they would nt have to waste any more wind,he was in here with it a while ago,faulkner
34801,34802,i thought you were out back somewhere,yes i says,faulkner
34803,34804,i got it,they could nt keep it away from me all afternoon,faulkner
34805,34806,the town s too small,i ve got to go out home a minute i says,faulkner
34807,34808,you can dock me if it ll make you feel any better,go ahead he says,faulkner
34809,34810,i can handle it now,no bad news i hope,faulkner
34811,34812,you ll have to go to the telegraph office and find that out i says,they ll have time to tell you,faulkner
34813,34814,i have nt,i just asked he says,faulkner
34815,34816,your mother knows she can depend on me,she ll appreciate it i says,faulkner
34817,34818,i wont be gone any longer than i have to,take your time he says,faulkner
34819,34820,i can handle it now,you go ahead,faulkner
34821,34822,i got the car and went home,once this morning twice at noon and now again with her and having to chase all over town and having to beg them to let me eat a little of the food i am paying for,faulkner
34823,34824,sometimes i think what s the use of anything,with the precedent i ve been set i must be crazy to keep on,faulkner
34825,34826,and now i reckon i ll get home just in time to take a nice long drive after a basket of tomatoes or something and then have to go back to town smelling like a camphor factory so my head wont explode right on my shoulders,i keep telling her there s not a dam thing in that aspirin except flour and water for imaginary invalids,faulkner
34827,34828,i says you dont know what a headache is,i says you think i d fool with that dam car at all if it depended on me,faulkner
34829,34830,i says i can get along without one i ve learned to get along without lots of things but if you want to risk yourself in that old wornout surrey with a halfgrown nigger boy all right because i says god looks after ben s kind god knows he ought to do something for him but if you think i m going to trust a thousand dollars worth of delicate machinery to a halfgrown nigger or a grown one either you d better buy him one yourself because i says you like to ride in the car and you know you do,dilsey said she was in the house,faulkner
34831,34832,i went on into the hall and listened but i did nt hear anything,i went up stairs but just as i passed her door she called me,faulkner
34833,34834,i just wanted to know who it was she says,i m here alone so much that i hear every sound,faulkner
34835,34836,you dont have to stay here i says,you could spend the whole day visiting like other women if you wanted to,faulkner
34837,34838,she came to the door,i thought maybe you were sick she says,faulkner
34839,34840,having to hurry through your dinner like you did,better luck next time i says,faulkner
34841,34842,what do you want,is anything wrong,faulkner
34843,34844,she says,what could be,faulkner
34845,34846,i says,cant i come home in the middle of the afternoon without upsetting the whole house,faulkner
34847,34848,have you seen quentin,she says,faulkner
34849,34850,she s in school i says,it s after three she says,faulkner
34851,34852,i heard the clock strike at least a half an hour ago,she ought to be home by now,faulkner
34853,34854,ought she,i says,faulkner
34855,34856,when have you ever seen her before dark,she ought to be home she says,faulkner
34857,34858,she has nt,i cant do anything with her she says,faulkner
34859,34860,i ve tried and i ve tried,and you wont let me for some reason i says,faulkner
34861,34862,so you ought to be satisfied,i went on to my room,faulkner
34863,34864,i turned the key easy and stood there until the knob turned,what i says,faulkner
34865,34866,i just thought something was wrong,not in here i says,faulkner
34867,34868,you ve come to the wrong place,i dont mean to worry you she says,faulkner
34869,34870,i m glad to hear that i says,i was nt sure,faulkner
34871,34872,i thought i might have been mistaken,do you want anything,faulkner
34873,34874,after a while she says no,not any thing,faulkner
34875,34876,then she went away,i took the box down and counted out the money and hid the box again and unlocked the door and went out,faulkner
34877,34878,i thought about the camphor but it would be too late now anyway,and i d just have one more round trip,faulkner
34879,34880,she was at her door waiting,you want anything from town,faulkner
34881,34882,i says,no she says,faulkner
34883,34884,i dont mean to meddle in your affairs,but i dont know what i d do if anything happened to you jason,faulkner
34885,34886,i m all right i says,just a headache,faulkner
34887,34888,i wish you d take some aspirin she says,i know you re not going to stop using the car,faulkner
34889,34890,what s the car got to do with it,i says,faulkner
34891,34892,how can a car give a man a headache,you know gasoline always made you sick she says,faulkner
34893,34894,ever since you were a child,i wish you d take some aspirin,faulkner
34895,34896,keep on wishing it i says,it wont hurt you,faulkner
34897,34898,i got in the car and started back to town,i had just turned onto the street when i saw a ford coming helling toward me,faulkner
34899,34900,all of a sudden it stopped,i could hear the wheels sliding and it slewed around and backed and whirled and just as i was thinking what the hell they were up to i saw that red tie,faulkner
34901,34902,then i recognised her face looking back through the window,it whirled into the alley,faulkner
34903,34904,i saw it turn again but when i got to the back street it was just disappearing running like hell,i saw red,faulkner
34905,34906,when i recognised that red tie after all i had told her i forgot about everything,i never thought about my head even until i came to the first forks and had to stop,faulkner
34907,34908,yet we spend money and spend money on roads and dam if it is nt like trying to drive over a sheet of corrugated iron roofing,i d like to know how a man could be expected to keep up with even a wheelbarrow,faulkner
34909,34910,i think too much of my car i m not going to hammer it to pieces like it was a ford,chances were they had stolen it anyway so why should they give a dam,faulkner
34911,34912,like i say blood always tells,if you ve got blood like that in you you ll do anything,faulkner
34913,34914,i says whatever claim you believe she has on you has already been discharged i says from now on you have only yourself to blame because you know what any sensible person would do,i says if i ve got to spend half my time being a dam detective at least i ll go where i can get paid for it,faulkner
34915,34916,so i had to stop there at the forks,then i remembered it,faulkner
34917,34918,it felt like somebody was inside with a hammer beating on it,i says i ve tried to keep you from being worried by her i says far as i m concerned let her go to hell as fast as she pleases and the sooner the better,faulkner
34919,34920,i says what else do you expect except every dam drummer and cheap show that comes to town because even these town jellybeans give her the goby now,you dont know what goes on i says you dont hear the talk that i hear and you can just bet i shut them up too,faulkner
34921,34922,i says my people owned slaves here when you all were running little shirt tail country stores and farming land no nigger would look at on shares,if they ever farmed it,faulkner
34923,34924,it s a good thing the lord did something for this country the folks that live on it never have,friday afternoon and from right here i could see three miles of land that had nt even been broken and every able bodied man in the county in town at that show,faulkner
34925,34926,i might have been a stranger starving to death and there was nt a soul in sight to ask which way to town even,and she trying to get me to take aspirin,faulkner
34927,34928,i says when i eat bread i ll do it at the table,i says you always talking about how much you give up for us when you could buy ten new dresses a year on the money you spend for those dam patent medicines,faulkner
34929,34930,it s not something to cure it i need it s just an even break not to have to have them but as long as i have to work ten hours a day to support a kitchen full of niggers in the style they re accustomed to and send them to the show where every other nigger in the county only he was late already,by the time he got there it would be over,faulkner
34931,34932,after a while he got up to the car and when i finally got it through his head if two people in a ford had passed him he said yes,so i went on and when i came to where the wagon road turned off i could see the tire tracks,faulkner
34933,34934,ab russell was in his lot but i did nt bother to ask him and i had nt got out of sight of his barn hardly when i saw the ford,they had tried to hide it,faulkner
34935,34936,done about as well at it as she did at everything else she did,like i say it s not that i object to so much maybe she cant help that it s because she has nt even got enough consideration for her own family to have any discretion,faulkner
34937,34938,i m afraid all the time i ll run into them right in the middle of the street or under a wagon on the square like a couple of dogs,i parked and got out,faulkner
34939,34940,and now i d have to go way around and cross a plowed field the only one i had seen since i left town with every step like somebody was walking along behind me hitting me on the head with a club,i kept thinking that when i got across the field at least i d have something level to walk on that would nt jolt me every step but when i got into the woods it was full of underbrush and i had to twist around through it and then i came to a ditch full of briers,faulkner
34941,34942,i went along it for a while but it got thicker and thicker and all the time earl probably telephoning home about where i was and getting mother all upset again,when i finally got through i had had to wind around so much that i had to stop and figure out just where the car would be,faulkner
34943,34944,i knew they would nt be far from it just under the closest bush so i turned and worked back toward the road,then i could nt tell just how far i was so i d have to stop and listen and then with my legs not using so much blood it all would go into my head like it would explode any minute and the sun getting down just to where it could shine straight into my eyes and my ears ringing so i could nt hear anything,faulkner
34945,34946,i went on trying to move quiet then i heard a dog or something and i knew that when he scented me he d have to come helling up then it would be all off,i had gotten beggar lice and twigs and stuff all over me inside my clothes and shoes and all and then i happened to look around and i had my hand right on a bunch of poison oak,faulkner
34947,34948,the only thing i could nt understand was why it was just poison oak and not a snake or something,so i did nt even bother to move it,faulkner
34949,34950,i just stood there until the dog went away,then i went on,faulkner
34951,34952,i did nt have any idea where the car was now,i could nt think about anything except my head and i d just stand in one place and sort of wonder if i had really seen a ford even and i did nt even care much whether i had or not,faulkner
34953,34954,like i say let her lay out all day and all night with everthing in town that wears pants what do i care,i dont owe anything to anybody that has no more consideration for me that would nt be a dam bit above planting that ford there and making me spend a whole afternoon and earl taking her back there and showing her the books just because he s too dam virtuous for this world,faulkner
34955,34956,i says you ll have one hell of a time in heaven without anybody s business to meddle in only dont you ever let me catch you at it i says i close my eyes to it because of your grandmother but just you let me catch you doing it one time on this place where my mother lives,these dam little slick haired squirts thinking they are raising so much hell i ll show them something about hell i says and you too,faulkner
34957,34958,i ll make him think that dam red tie is the latch string to hell if he thinks he can run the woods with my niece,with the sun and all in my eyes and my blood going so i kept thinking every time my head would go on and burst and get it over with with briers and things grabbing at me then i came onto the sand ditch where they had been and i recognised the tree where the car was and just as i got out of the ditch and started running i heard the car start,faulkner
34959,34960,it went off fast blowing the horn,they kept on blowing it like it was saying yah,faulkner
34961,34962,yah,yaaahhhhhhhh going out of sight,faulkner
34963,34964,i got to the road just in time to see it go out of sight,by the time i got up to where my car was they were clean out of sight the horn still blowing,faulkner
34965,34966,well i never thought anything about it except i was saying run,run back to town,faulkner
34967,34968,run home and try to convince mother that i never saw you in that car,try to make her believe that i dont know who he was,faulkner
34969,34970,try to make her believe that i did nt miss ten feet of catching you in that ditch,try to make her believe you were standing up too,faulkner
34971,34972,it kept on saying yahhhhh yahhhhh yaaahhhhhhhhh getting fainter and fainter,then it quit and i could hear a cow lowing up at russell s barn,faulkner
34973,34974,and still i never thought,i went up to the door and opened it and raised my foot,faulkner
34975,34976,i kind of thought then that the car was leaning a little more than the slant of the road would be but i never found it out until i got in and started off,well i just sat there,faulkner
34977,34978,it was getting on toward sundown and town was about five miles,they never even had guts enough to puncture it to jab a hole in it,faulkner
34979,34980,they just let the air out,i just stood there for a while thinking about that kitchen full of niggers and not one of them had time to lift a tire onto the rack and screw up a couple of bolts,faulkner
34981,34982,it was kind of funny because even she could nt have seen far enough ahead to take the pump out on purpose unless she thought about it while he was letting out the air maybe,but what it probably was was somebody took it out and gave it to ben to play with for a squirt gun because they d take the whole car to pieces if he wanted it and dilsey says aint nobody teched yo car,faulkner
34983,34984,what we want to fool with hit fer,and i says you re a nigger,faulkner
34985,34986,you re lucky do you know it,i says i ll swap with you any day because it takes a white man not to have anymore sense than to worry about what a little slut of a girl does,faulkner
34987,34988,i walked up to russell s,he had a pump,faulkner
34989,34990,that was just an oversight on their part i reckon,only i still could nt believe she d have had the nerve to,faulkner
34991,34992,i kept thinking that,i dont know why it is i cant seem to learn that a woman ll do anything,faulkner
34993,34994,i kept thinking let s forget for a while how i feel toward you and how you feel toward me i just would nt do you this way,i would nt do you this way no matter what you had done to me,faulkner
34995,34996,because like i say blood is blood and you cant get around it,it s not playing a joke that any eight year old boy could have thought of it s letting your own uncle be laughed at by a man that would wear a red tie,faulkner
34997,34998,they come into town and call us all a bunch of hicks and think it s too small to hold them,well he does nt know just how right he is,faulkner
34999,35000,and her too,if that s the way she feels about it she d better keep right on going and a dam good riddance,faulkner
35001,35002,i stopped and returned russell s pump and drove on to town,i went to the drugstore and got a shot and then i went to the telegraph office,faulkner
35003,35004,it had closed at forty points down,forty times five dollars buy something with that if you can and she ll say i ve got to have it i ve just got to and i ll say that s too bad you ll have to try somebody else i have nt got any money i ve been too busy to make any,faulkner
35005,35006,i just looked at him,i ll tell you some news i says,faulkner
35007,35008,you ll be astonished to learn that i am interested in the cotton market i says,that never occurred to you did it,faulkner
35009,35010,i did my best to deliver it he says,i tried the store twice and called up your house but they did nt know where you were he says digging in the drawer,faulkner
35011,35012,deliver what,i says,faulkner
35013,35014,he handed me a telegram,what time did this come,faulkner
35015,35016,i says,about half past three he says,faulkner
35017,35018,and now it s ten minutes past five i says,i tried to deliver it he says,faulkner
35019,35020,i could nt find you,that s not my fault is it,faulkner
35021,35022,i says,i opened it just to see what kind of a lie they d tell me this time,faulkner
35023,35024,they must be in one hell of a shape if they ve got to come all the way to mississippi to steal ten dollars a month,sell it says,faulkner
35025,35026,the market will be unstable with a general downward tendency,do not be alarmed following government report,faulkner
35027,35028,how much would a message like this cost,i says,faulkner
35029,35030,he told me,they paid it he says,faulkner
35031,35032,then i owe them that much i says,i already knew this,faulkner
35033,35034,send this collect i says taking a blank,buy i wrote market just on point of blowing its head off,faulkner
35035,35036,occasional flurries for purpose of hooking a few more country suckers who have nt got in to the telegraph office yet,do not be alarmed,faulkner
35037,35038,send that collect i says,he looked at the message then he looked at the clock,faulkner
35039,35040,market closed an hour ago he says,well i says,faulkner
35041,35042,that s not my fault either,i did nt invent it i just bought a little of it while under the impression that the telegraph company would keep me informed as to what it was doing,faulkner
35043,35044,a report is posted whenever it comes in he says,yes i says,faulkner
35045,35046,and in memphis they have it on a blackboard every ten seconds i says,i was within sixtyseven miles of there once this afternoon,faulkner
35047,35048,he looked at the message,you want to send this,faulkner
35049,35050,he says,i still have nt changed my mind i says,faulkner
35051,35052,i wrote the other one out and counted the money,and this one too if you re sure you can spell buy,faulkner
35053,35054,i went back to the store,i could hear the band from down the street,faulkner
35055,35056,prohibition s a fine thing,used to be they d come in saturday with just one pair of shoes in the family and him wearing them and they d go down to the express office and get his package now they all go to the show barefooted with the merchants in the door like a row of tigers or something in a cage watching them pass,faulkner
35057,35058,what,i says,faulkner
35059,35060,he looked at his watch,then he went to the door and looked at the courthouse clock,faulkner
35061,35062,you ought to have a dollar watch i says,it wont cost you so much to believe it s lying each time,faulkner
35063,35064,what,he says,faulkner
35065,35066,nothing i says,hope i have nt inconvenienced you,faulkner
35067,35068,we were not busy much he says,they all went to the show,faulkner
35069,35070,it s all right,if it s not all right i says you know what you can do about it,faulkner
35071,35072,i said it was all right he says,i heard you i says,faulkner
35073,35074,and if it s not all right you know what you can do about it,do you want to quit,faulkner
35075,35076,he says,it s not my business i says,faulkner
35077,35078,my wishes dont matter,but dont get the idea that you are protecting me by keeping me,faulkner
35079,35080,you d be a good business man if you d let yourself jason he says,at least i can tend to my own business and let other people s alone i says,faulkner
35081,35082,i dont know why you are trying to make me fire you he says,you know you could quit anytime and there would nt be any hard feelings between us,faulkner
35083,35084,maybe that s why i dont quit i says,as long as i tend to my job that s what you are paying me for,faulkner
35085,35086,i went on to the back and got a drink of water and went on out to the back door,job had the cultivators all set up at last,faulkner
35087,35088,it was quiet there and pretty soon my head got a little easier,i could hear them singing now and then the band played again,faulkner
35089,35090,well let them get every quarter and dime in the county it was no skin off my back,i ve done what i could a man that can live as long as i have and not know when to quit is a fool,faulkner
35091,35092,especially as it s no business of mine,if it was my own daughter now it would be different because she would nt have time to she d have to work some to feed a few invalids and idiots and niggers because how could i have the face to bring anybody there,faulkner
35093,35094,i ve too much respect for anybody to do that,i m a man i can stand it it s my own flesh and blood and i d like to see the color of the man s eyes that would speak disrespectful of any woman that was my friend it s these dam good women that do it i d like to see the good churchgoing woman that s half as square as lorraine whore or no whore,faulkner
35095,35096,like i say if i was to get married you d go up like a balloon and you know it and she says i want you to be happy to have a family of your own not to slave your life away for us,but i ll be gone soon and then you can take a wife but you ll never find a woman who is worthy of you and i says yes i could,faulkner
35097,35098,you d get right up out of your grave you know you would,i says no thank you i have all the women i can take care of now if i married a wife she d probably turn out to be a hophead or something,faulkner
35099,35100,that s all we lack in this family i says,the sun was down beyond the methodist church now and the pigeons were flying back and forth around the steeple and when the band stopped i could hear them cooing,faulkner
35101,35102,it had nt been four months since christmas and yet they were almost as thick as ever,i reckon parson walthall was getting a belly full of them now,faulkner
35103,35104,you d have thought we were shooting people with him making speeches and even holding onto a man s gun when they came over,talking about peace on earth good will toward all and not a sparrow can fall to earth,faulkner
35105,35106,but what does he care how thick they get he has nt got anything to do what does he care what time it is,he pays no taxes he does nt have to see his money going every year to have the courthouse clock cleaned to where it ll run,faulkner
35107,35108,they had to pay a man fortyfive dollars to clean it,i counted over a hundred halfhatched pigeons on the ground,faulkner
35109,35110,you d think they d have sense enough to leave town,it s a good thing i dont have anymore ties than a pigeon i ll say that,faulkner
35111,35112,the band was playing again a loud fast tune like they were breaking up,i reckon they d be satisfied now,faulkner
35113,35114,maybe they d have enough music to entertain them while they drove fourteen or fifteen miles home and unharnessed in the dark and fed the stock and milked,all they d have to do would be to whistle the music and tell the jokes to the live stock in the barn and then they could count up how much they d made by not taking the stock to the show too,faulkner
35115,35116,they could figure that if a man had five children and seven mules he cleared a quarter by taking his family to the show,just like that,faulkner
35117,35118,earl came back with a couple of packages,here s some more stuff going out he says,faulkner
35119,35120,where s uncle job,gone to the show i imagine i says,faulkner
35121,35122,unless you watched him,he does nt slip off he says,faulkner
35123,35124,i can depend on him,meaning me by that i says,faulkner
35125,35126,he went to the door and looked out listening,that s a good band he says,faulkner
35127,35128,it s about time they were breaking up i d say,unless they re going to spend the night there i says,faulkner
35129,35130,the swallows had begun and i could hear the sparrows beginning to swarm in the trees in the courthouse yard,every once in a while a bunch of them would come swirling around in sight above the roof then go away,faulkner
35131,35132,they are as big a nuisance as the pigeons to my notion,you cant even sit in the courthouse yard for them,faulkner
35133,35134,first thing you know bing,right on your hat,faulkner
35135,35136,but it would take a millionaire to afford to shoot them at five cents a shot,if they d just put a little poison out there in the square they d get rid of them in a day because if a merchant cant keep his stock from running around the square he d better try to deal in something besides chickens something that dont eat like plows or onions,faulkner
35137,35138,and if a man dont keep his dogs up he either dont want it or he has nt any business with one,like i say if all the businesses in a town are run like country businesses you re going to have a country town,faulkner
35139,35140,it wont do you any good if they have broke up i says,they ll have to hitch up and take out to get home by midnight as it is,faulkner
35141,35142,well he says,they enjoy it,faulkner
35143,35144,let them spend a little money on a show now and then,a hill farmer works pretty hard and gets mighty little for it,faulkner
35145,35146,there s no law making them farm in the hills i says,or anywhere else,faulkner
35147,35148,where would you and me be if it was nt for the farmers,he says,faulkner
35149,35150,i d be home right now i says,lying down with an ice pack on my head,faulkner
35151,35152,you have these headaches too often he says,why dont you have your teeth examined good,faulkner
35153,35154,did he go over them all this morning,did who,faulkner
35155,35156,i says,you said you went to the dentist this morning,faulkner
35157,35158,do you object to my having the headache on your time,i says,faulkner
35159,35160,is that it,they were crossing the alley now coming up from the show,faulkner
35161,35162,there they come he says,i reckon i better get up front,faulkner
35163,35164,he went on,it s a curious thing how no matter what s wrong with you a man ll tell you to have your teeth examined and a woman ll tell you to get married,faulkner
35165,35166,it always takes a man that never made much at any thing to tell you how to run your business though,like these college professors without a whole pair of socks to his name telling you how to make a million in ten years and a woman that could nt even get a husband can always tell you how to raise a family,faulkner
35167,35168,old man job came up with the wagon,after a while he got through wrapping the lines around the whip socket,faulkner
35169,35170,well i says,was it a good show,faulkner
35171,35172,i aint been yit he says,but i kin be arrested in dat tent tonight dough,faulkner
35173,35174,like hell you have nt i says,you ve been away from here since three oclock,faulkner
35175,35176,mr earl was just back here looking for you,i been tendin to my business he says,faulkner
35177,35178,mr earl knows whar i been,you may can fool him i says,faulkner
35179,35180,i wont tell on you,den he s de onliest man here i d try to fool he says,faulkner
35181,35182,whut i want to waste my time foolin a man whut i dont keer whether i sees him satdy night er not,i wont try to fool you he says,faulkner
35183,35184,you too smart fer me,yes suh he says looking busy as hell putting five or six little packages into the wagon,faulkner
35185,35186,you s too smart fer me,aint a man in dis town kin keep up wid you fer smartness,faulkner
35187,35188,you fools a man whut so smart he cant even keep up wid hisself he says getting in the wagon and unwrapping the reins,who s that,faulkner
35189,35190,i says,dat s mr jason compson he says,faulkner
35191,35192,git up dar dan,one of the wheels was just about to come off,faulkner
35193,35194,i watched to see if he d get out of the alley before it did,just turn any vehicle over to a nigger though,faulkner
35195,35196,i says that old rattletrap s just an eyesore yet you ll keep it standing there in the carriage house a hundred years just so that boy can ride to the cemetery once a week,i says he s not the first fellow that ll have to do things he does nt want to,faulkner
35197,35198,i d make him ride in that car like a civilised man or stay at home,what does he know about where he goes or what he goes in and us keeping a carriage and a horse so he can take a ride on sunday afternoon,faulkner
35199,35200,a lot job cared whether the wheel came off or not long as he would nt have too far to walk back,like i say the only place for them is in the field where they d have to work from sunup to sundown,faulkner
35201,35202,they cant stand prosperity or an easy job,let one stay around white people for a while and he s not worth killing,faulkner
35203,35204,they get so they can outguess you about work before your very eyes like roskus the only mistake he ever made was he got careless one day and died,shirking and stealing and giving you a little more lip and a little more lip until some day you have to lay them out with a scantling or something,faulkner
35205,35206,well it s earl s business,but i d hate to have my business advertised over this town by an old doddering nigger and a wagon that you thought every time it turned a corner it would come all to pieces,faulkner
35207,35208,the sun was all high up in the air now and inside it was beginning to get dark,i went up front,faulkner
35209,35210,the square was empty,earl was back closing the safe and then the clock begun to strike,faulkner
35211,35212,you lock the back door,he says,faulkner
35213,35214,i went back and locked it and came back,i suppose you re going to the show tonight he says,faulkner
35215,35216,i gave you those passes yesterday did nt i,yes i says,faulkner
35217,35218,you want them back,no no he says,faulkner
35219,35220,i just forgot whether i gave them to you or not,no sense in wasting them,faulkner
35221,35222,he locked the door and said goodnight and went on,the sparrows were still rattling away in the trees but the square was empty except for a few cars,faulkner
35223,35224,there was a ford in front of the drugstore but i did nt even look at it,i know when i ve had enough of anything,faulkner
35225,35226,i dont mind trying to help her but i know when i ve had enough,i guess i could teach luster to drive it then they could chase her all day long if they wanted to and i could stay home and play with ben,faulkner
35227,35228,i went in and got a couple of cigars,then i thought i d have another headache shot for luck and i stood and talked with them a while,faulkner
35229,35230,well mac says,i reckon you ve got your money on the yankees this year,faulkner
35231,35232,what for,i says,faulkner
35233,35234,the pennant he says,not anything in the league can beat them,faulkner
35235,35236,like hell there s not i says,they re shot i says,faulkner
35237,35238,you think a team can be that lucky forever,i dont call it luck mac says,faulkner
35239,35240,i would nt bet on any team that fellow ruth played on i says,even if i knew it was going to win,faulkner
35241,35242,yes,mac says,faulkner
35243,35244,i can name you a dozen men in either league who re more valuable than he is i says,what have you got against ruth,faulkner
35245,35246,mac says,nothing i says,faulkner
35247,35248,i have nt got any thing against him,i dont even like to look at his picture,faulkner
35249,35250,i went on out,the lights were coming on and people going along the streets toward home,faulkner
35251,35252,sometimes the sparrows never got still until full dark,the night they turned on the new lights around the courthouse it waked them up and they were flying around and blundering into the lights all night long,faulkner
35253,35254,they kept it up two or three nights then one morning they were all gone,then after about two months they all came back again,faulkner
35255,35256,i drove on home,there were no lights in the house yet but they d all be looking out the windows and dilsey jawing away in the kitchen like it was her own food she was having to keep hot until i got there,faulkner
35257,35258,you d think to hear her that there was nt but one supper in the world and that was the one she had to keep back a few minutes on my account,well at least i could come home one time without finding ben and that nigger hanging on the gate like a bear and a monkey in the same cage,faulkner
35259,35260,just let it come toward sundown and he d head for the gate like a cow for the barn hanging onto it and bobbing his head and sort of moaning to himself,that s a hog for punishment for you,faulkner
35261,35262,if what had happened to him for fooling with open gates had happened to me i never would want to see another one,i often wondered what he d be thinking about down there at the gate watching the girls going home from school trying to want something he could nt even remember he did nt and could nt want any longer,faulkner
35263,35264,and what he d think when they d be undressing him and he d happen to take a look at himself and begin to cry like he d do,but like i say they never did enough of that,faulkner
35265,35266,i says i know what you need you need what they did to ben then you d behave,and if you dont know what that was i says ask dilsey to tell you,faulkner
35267,35268,there was a light in mother s room,i put the car up and went on into the kitchen,faulkner
35269,35270,luster and ben were there,where s dilsey,faulkner

35421,35422,let me know when supper s ready i says reading the paper again,i heard her climbing the stairs dragging her feet and grunting and groaning like they were straight up and three feet apart,faulkner
35423,35424,i heard her at mother s door then i heard her calling quentin like the door was locked then she went back to mother s room and then mother went and talked to quentin,then they came down stairs,faulkner
35425,35426,i read the paper,dilsey came back to the door,faulkner
35427,35428,come on she says fo you kin think up some mo devilment,you just tryin yoself tonight,faulkner
35429,35430,i went to the diningroom,quentin was sitting with her head bent,faulkner
35431,35432,she had painted her face again,her nose looked like a porcelain insulator,faulkner
35433,35434,i m glad you feel well enough to come down i says to mother,it s little enough i can do for you to come to the table she says,faulkner
35435,35436,no matter how i feel,i realise that when a man works all day he likes to be surrounded by his family at the supper table,faulkner
35437,35438,i want to please you,i only wish you and quentin got along better,faulkner
35439,35440,it would be easier for me,we get along all right i says,faulkner
35441,35442,i dont mind her staying locked up in her room all day if she wants to,but i cant have all this whoopdedo and sulking at mealtimes,faulkner
35443,35444,i know that s a lot to ask her but i m that way in my own house,your house i meant to say,faulkner
35445,35446,it s yours mother says,you are the head of it now,faulkner
35447,35448,quentin had nt looked up,i helped the plates and she begun to eat,faulkner
35449,35450,did you get a good piece of meat,i says,faulkner
35451,35452,if you did nt i ll try to find you a better one,she did nt say anything,faulkner
35453,35454,i say did you get a good piece of meat,i says,faulkner
35455,35456,what,she says,faulkner
35457,35458,yes,it s all right,faulkner
35459,35460,will you have some more rice,i says,faulkner
35461,35462,no she says,better let me give you some more i says,faulkner
35463,35464,i dont want any more she says,not at all i says,faulkner
35465,35466,you re welcome,is your headache gone,faulkner
35467,35468,mother says,headache,faulkner
35469,35470,i says,i was afraid you were developing one she says,faulkner
35471,35472,when you came in this afternoon,oh i says,faulkner
35473,35474,no it did nt show up,we stayed so busy this afternoon i forgot about it,faulkner
35475,35476,was that why you were late,mother says,faulkner
35477,35478,i could see quentin listening,i looked at her,faulkner
35479,35480,her knife and fork were still going but i caught her looking at me then she looked at her plate again,i loaned my car to a fellow about three oclock and i had to wait until he got back with it,faulkner
35481,35482,i ate for a while,who was it,faulkner
35483,35484,mother says,it was one of those show men i says,faulkner
35485,35486,it seems his sister s husband was out riding with some town woman and he was chasing them,quentin sat perfectly still chewing,faulkner
35487,35488,you ought not to lend your car to people like that mother says,you are too generous with it,faulkner
35489,35490,that s why i never call on you for it if i can help it,i was beginning to think that myself for a while i says,faulkner
35491,35492,but he got back all right,he says he found what he was looking for,faulkner
35493,35494,who was the woman,mother says,faulkner
35495,35496,i ll tell you later i says,i dont like to talk about such things before quentin,faulkner
35497,35498,quentin had quit eating,every once in a while she d take a drink of water then she d sit there crumbling a biscuit up her face bent over her plate,faulkner
35499,35500,yes mother says,i suppose women who stay shut up like i do have no idea what goes on in this town,faulkner
35501,35502,yes i says,they dont,faulkner
35503,35504,my life has been so different from that mother says,thank god i dont know about such wickedness,faulkner
35505,35506,i dont even want to know about it,i m not like most people,faulkner
35507,35508,i did nt say any more,quentin sat there crumbling the biscuit until i quit eating,faulkner
35509,35510,without looking at anybody,what,faulkner
35511,35512,i says,sure you can go,faulkner
35513,35514,were you waiting on us,she looked at me,faulkner
35515,35516,she had crumpled all the bread but her hands still went on like they were crumpling it yet and her eyes looked like they were cornered or something and then she started biting her mouth like it ought to have poisoned her with all that red lead,grandmother she says,faulkner
35517,35518,i says,why does he treat me like this grandmother,faulkner
35519,35520,she says,i never hurt him,faulkner
35521,35522,i want you all to get along with one another mother says,you are all that s left now and i do want you all to get along better,faulkner
35523,35524,it s his fault she says,he wont let me alone and i have to,faulkner
35525,35526,not another word,then why wont he let me alone,faulkner
35527,35528,she says,it s his bread you and i eat,faulkner
35529,35530,it s only right that he should expect obedience from you,it s his fault she says,faulkner
35531,35532,she jumped up,he makes me do it,faulkner
35533,35534,if he would just she looked at us her eyes cornered kind of jerking her arms against her sides,if i would just what,faulkner
35535,35536,i says,whatever i do it s your fault she says,faulkner
35537,35538,if i m bad it s because i had to be,you made me,faulkner
35539,35540,i wish i was dead,i wish we were all dead,faulkner
35541,35542,then she ran,we heard her run up the stairs,faulkner
35543,35544,then a door slammed,that s the first sensible thing she ever said i says,faulkner
35545,35546,she did nt go to school today mother says,how do you know,faulkner
35547,35548,i says,were you down town,faulkner
35549,35550,i just know she says,i wish you could be kinder to her,faulkner
35551,35552,if i did that i d have to arrange to see her more than once a day i says,you ll have to make her come to the table every meal,faulkner
35553,35554,then i could give her an extra piece of meat every time,there are little things you could do she says,faulkner
35555,35556,like not paying any attention when you ask me to see that she goes to school,i says,faulkner
35557,35558,she did nt go to school today she says,i just know she did nt,faulkner
35559,35560,she says she went for a car ride with one of the boys this afternoon and you followed her,how could i i says,faulkner
35561,35562,when somebody had my car all afternoon,whether or not she was in school today is already past i says,faulkner
35563,35564,if you ve got to worry about it worry about next monday,i wanted you and she to get along with one another she says,faulkner
35565,35566,but she has inherited all of the headstrong traits,quentin s too,faulkner
35567,35568,i thought at the time with the heritage she would already have to give her that name too,sometimes i think she is the judgment of both of them upon me,faulkner
35569,35570,good lord i says,you ve got a fine mind,faulkner
35571,35572,no wonder you keep yourself sick all the time,what,faulkner
35573,35574,she says,i dont understand,faulkner
35575,35576,i hope not i says,a good woman misses a lot she s better off without knowing,faulkner
35577,35578,they were both that way she says,they would make interest with your father against me when i tried to correct them,faulkner
35579,35580,he was always saying they did nt need controlling that they already knew what cleanliness and honesty were which was all that anyone could hope to be taught,and now i hope he s satisfied,faulkner
35581,35582,you ve got ben to depend on i says,cheer up,faulkner
35583,35584,they deliberately shut me out of their lives she says,it was always her and quentin,faulkner
35585,35586,they were always conspiring against me,against you too though you were too young to realise it,faulkner
35587,35588,they always looked on you and me as outsiders like they did your uncle maury,i always told your father that they were allowed too much freedom to be together too much,faulkner
35589,35590,when quentin started to school we had to let her go the next year so she could be with him,she could nt bear for any of you to do anything she could nt,faulkner
35591,35592,it was vanity in her vanity and false pride,and then when her troubles began i knew that quentin would feel that he had to do something just as bad,faulkner
35593,35594,and that one more of them would be more than he could stand,he could have controlled her she says,faulkner
35595,35596,he seemed to be the only person she had any consideration for,but that is a part of the judgment too i suppose,faulkner
35597,35598,yes i says,too bad it was nt me instead of him,faulkner
35599,35600,you d be a lot better off,you say things like that to hurt me she says,faulkner
35601,35602,i deserve it though,when they began to sell the land to send quentin to harvard i told your father that he must make an equal provision for you,faulkner
35603,35604,then when herbert offered to take you into the bank i said jason is provided for now and when all the expense began to pile up and i was forced to sell our furniture and the rest of the pasture i wrote her at once because i said she will realise that she and quentin have had their share and part of jason s too and that it depends on her now to compensate him,i said she will do that out of respect for her father,faulkner
35605,35606,i believed that then,but i m just a poor old woman i was raised to believe that people would deny themselves for their own flesh and blood,faulkner
35607,35608,it s my fault,you were right to reproach me,faulkner
35609,35610,do you think i need any man s help to stand on my feet,i says,faulkner
35611,35612,let alone a woman that cant name the father of her own child,jason she says,faulkner
35613,35614,all right i says,i did nt mean that,faulkner
35615,35616,of course not,if i believed that were possible after all my suffering,faulkner
35617,35618,of course it s not i says,i did nt mean it,faulkner
35619,35620,i hope that at least is spared me she says,sure it is i says,faulkner
35621,35622,she s too much like both of them to doubt that,i could nt bear that she says,faulkner
35623,35624,then quit thinking about it i says,has she been worrying you any more about getting out at night,faulkner
35625,35626,no,i made her realise that it was for her own good and that she d thank me for it some day,faulkner
35627,35628,she takes her books with her and studies after i lock the door,i see the light on as late as eleven oclock some nights,faulkner
35629,35630,how do you know she s studying,i says,faulkner
35631,35632,i dont know what else she d do in there alone she says,she never did read any,faulkner
35633,35634,no i says,you would nt know,faulkner
35635,35636,and you can thank your stars for that i says,only what would be the use in saying it aloud,faulkner
35637,35638,it would just have her crying on me again,i heard her go up stairs,faulkner
35639,35640,then she called quentin and quentin says what,through the door,faulkner
35641,35642,goodnight mother says,then i heard the key in the lock and mother went back to her room,faulkner
35643,35644,when i finished my cigar and went up the light was still on,i could see the empty keyhole but i could nt hear a sound,faulkner
35645,35646,she studied quiet,maybe she learned that in school,faulkner
35647,35648,i told mother goodnight and went on to my room and got the box out and counted it again,i could hear the great american gelding snoring away like a planing mill,faulkner
35649,35650,i read somewhere they d fix men that way to give them women s voices,but maybe he did nt know what they d done to him,faulkner
35651,35652,i dont reckon he even knew what he had been trying to do or why mr burgess knocked him out with the fence picket,and if they d just sent him on to jackson while he was under the ether he d never have known the difference,faulkner
35653,35654,but that would have been too simple for a compson to think of,not half complex enough,faulkner
35655,35656,having to wait to do it at all until he broke out and tried to run a little girl down on the street with her own father looking at him,well like i say they never started soon enough with their cutting and they quit too quick,faulkner
35657,35658,i know at least two more that needed something like that and one of them not over a mile away either,but then i dont reckon even that would do any good,faulkner
35659,35660,like i say once a bitch always a bitch,and just let me have twentyfour hours without any dam new york jew to advise me what it s going to do,faulkner
35661,35662,i do nt want to make a killing save that to suck in the smart gamblers with,i just want an even chance to get my money back,faulkner
35663,35664,and once i ve done that they can bring all beale street and all bedlam in here and two of them can sleep in my bed and another one can have my place at the table too,she wore a stiff black straw hat perched upon her turban and a maroon velvet cape with a border of mangy and anonymous fur above a dress of purple silk and she stood in the door for a while with her myriad and sunken face lifted to the weather and one gaunt hand flacsoled as the belly of a fish then she moved the cape aside and examined the bosom of her gown,faulkner
35665,35666,the gown fell gauntly from her shoulders across her fallen breasts then tightened upon her paunch and fell again ballooning a little above the nether garments which she would remove layer by layer as the spring accomplished and the warm days in color regal and moribund,she had been a big woman once but now her skeleton rose draped loosely in unpadded skin that tightened again upon a paunch almost dropsical as though muscle and tissue had been courage or fortitude which the days or the years had consumed until only the indomitable skeleton was left rising like a ruin or a landmark above the somnolent and impervious guts and above that the collapsed face that gave the impression of the bones themselves being outside the flesh lifted into the driving day with an expression at once fatalistic and of a child s astonished disappointment until she turned and entered the house again and closed the door,faulkner
35667,35668,the earth immediately about the door was bare,it had a patina as though from the soles of bare feet in generations like old silver or the walls of mexican houses which have been plastered by hand,faulkner
35669,35670,beside the house shading it in summer stood three mulberry trees the fledged leaves that would later be broad and placid as the palms of hands streaming flatly undulant upon the driving air,a pair of jaybirds came up from nowhere whirled up on the blast like gaudy scraps of cloth or paper and lodged in the mulberries where they swung in raucous tilt and recover screaming into the wind that ripped their harsh cries onward and away like scraps of paper or of cloth in turn,faulkner
35671,35672,then three more joined them and they swung and tilted in the wrung branches for a time screaming,the door of the cabin opened and dilsey emerged once more this time in a man s felt hat and an army overcoat beneath the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress fell in uneven balloonings streaming too about her as she crossed the yard and mounted the steps to the kitchen door,faulkner
35673,35674,a moment later she emerged carrying an open umbrella now which she slanted ahead into the wind and crossed to the woodpile and laid the umbrella down still open,immediately she caught at it and arrested it and held to it for a while looking about her,faulkner
35675,35676,then she closed it and laid it down and stacked stovewood into her crooked arm against her breast and picked up the umbrella and got it open at last and returned to the steps and held the wood precariously balanced while she contrived to close the umbrella which she propped in the corner just within the door,she dumped the wood into the box behind the stove,faulkner
35677,35678,then she removed the overcoat and hat and took a soiled apron down from the wall and put it on and built a fire in the stove,while she was doing so rattling the grate bars and clattering the lids mrs compson began to call her from the head of the stairs,faulkner
35679,35680,she wore a dressing gown of quilted black satin holding it close under her chin,in the other hand she held a red rubber hot water bottle and she stood at the head of the back stairway calling dilsey at steady and inflectionless intervals into the quiet stairwell that descended into complete darkness then opened again where a gray window fell across it,faulkner
35681,35682,dilsey she called without inflection or emphasis or haste as though she were not listening for a reply at all,dilsey,faulkner
35683,35684,dilsey answered and ceased clattering the stove but before she could cross the kitchen mrs compson called her again and before she crossed the diningroom and brought her head into relief against the gray splash of the window still again,all right dilsey said,faulkner
35685,35686,all right here i is,i ll fill hit soon ez i git some hot water,faulkner
35687,35688,she gathered up her skirts and mounted the stairs wholly blotting the gray light,put hit down dar en gawn back to bed,faulkner
35689,35690,i could nt understand what was the matter mrs compson said,i ve been lying awake for an hour at least without hearing a sound from the kitchen,faulkner
35691,35692,you put hit down and gawn back to bed dilsey said,she toiled painfully up the steps shapeless breathing heavily,faulkner
35693,35694,i thought maybe you were waiting for me to come down and start the fire,dilsey reached the top of the stairs and took the water bottle,faulkner
35695,35696,i ll fix hit in a minute she said,luster overslep dis mawnin up half de night at dat show,faulkner
35697,35698,i gwine build de fire myself,go on now so you wont wake de others swell i ready,faulkner
35699,35700,if you permit luster to do things that interfere with his work you ll have to suffer for it yourself mrs compson said,jason wont like this if he hears about it,faulkner
35701,35702,you know he wont,twus nt none of jason s money he went on dilsey said,faulkner
35703,35704,dat s one thing shot she went on down the stairs,mrs compson returned to her room,faulkner
35705,35706,as she got into bed again she could hear dilsey yet descending the stairs with a sort of painful and terrific slowness that would have become maddening had it not presently ceased beyond the flapping diminishment of the pantry door,she entered the kitchen and built up the fire and began to prepare breakfast,faulkner
35707,35708,in the midst of this she ceased and went to the window and looked out toward her cabin then she went to the door and opened it and shouted into the driving weather,luster,faulkner
35709,35710,she shouted standing to listen tilting her face from the wind,you luster,faulkner
35711,35712,she listened then as she prepared to shout again luster appeared around the corner of the kitchen,maam,faulkner
35713,35714,he said innocently so innocently that dilsey looked down at him for a moment motionless with something more than mere surprise,whar you at,faulkner
35715,35716,she said,nowhere he said,faulkner
35717,35718,jes in de cellar,whut you coin in de cellar,faulkner

35733,35734,she shut the door,luster went to the woodpile,faulkner
35735,35736,the five jaybirds whirled over the house screaming and into the mulberries again,he watched them,faulkner
35737,35738,he picked up a rock and threw it,whoo he said,faulkner
35739,35740,git on back to hell whar you belong at,taint monday yit,faulkner
35741,35742,he loaded himself mountainously with stove wood,he could not see over it and he staggered to the steps and up them and blundered crashing against the door shedding billets,faulkner
35743,35744,then dilsey came and opened the door for him and he blundered across the kitchen,you luster hah,faulkner
35745,35746,she shouted but he had already hurled the wood into the box with a thunderous crash,hah,faulkner
35747,35748,he said,is you tryin to wake up de whole house,faulkner
35749,35750,dilsey said,she hit him on the back of his head with the flat of her hand,faulkner
35751,35752,go on up dar and git benjy dressed now,yessum he said,faulkner
35753,35754,he went toward the outer door,whar you gwine dilsey said,faulkner

35757,35758,go on now,yessum luster said,faulkner
35759,35760,he returned and left by the diningroom door,after a while it ceased to flap,faulkner
35761,35762,dilsey prepared to make biscuit,as she ground the sifter steadily above the bread board she sang to herself at first something without particular tune or words repetitive mournful and plaintive austere as she ground a faint steady snowing of flour onto the bread board,faulkner
35763,35764,the stove had begun to heat the room and to fill it with murmurous minors of the fire and presently she was singing louder as if her voice too had been thawed out by the growing warmth and then mrs compson called her name again from within the house,dilsey raised her face as if her eyes could and did penetrate the walls and ceiling and saw the old woman in her quilted dressing gown at the head of the stairs calling her name with machinelike regularity,faulkner
35765,35766,oh lawd dilsey said,she set the sifter down and swept up the hem of her apron and wiped her hands and caught up the bottle from the chair on which she had laid it and gathered her apron about the handle of the kettle which was now jetting faintly,faulkner
35767,35768,jes a minute she called,de water jes dis minute got hot,faulkner
35769,35770,it was not the bottle which mrs compson wanted however and clutching it by the neck like a dead hen dilsey went to the foot of the stairs and looked upward,aint luster up dar wid him,faulkner
35771,35772,she said,luster has nt been in the house,faulkner
35773,35774,i ve been lying here listening for him,i knew he would be late but i did hope he d come in time to keep benjamin from disturbing jason on jason s one day in the week to sleep in the morning,faulkner

35799,35800,go on now she said toiling upward,mrs compson stood watching her as she mounted steadying herself against the wall with one hand holding her skirts up with the other,faulkner
35801,35802,are you going to wake him up just to dress him,she said,faulkner
35803,35804,dilsey stopped,with her foot lifted to the next step she stood there her hand against the wall and the gray splash of the window behind her motionless and shapeless she loomed,faulkner
35805,35806,he aint awake den,she said,faulkner
35807,35808,he was nt when i looked in mrs compson said,but it s past his time,faulkner
35809,35810,he never does sleep after half past seven,you know he does nt,faulkner
35811,35812,dilsey said nothing,she made no further move but though she could not see her save as a blobby shape without depth mrs compson knew that she had lowered her face a little and that she stood now like cows do in the rain holding the empty water bottle by its neck,faulkner
35813,35814,you re not the one who has to bear it mrs compson said,it s not your responsibility,faulkner
35815,35816,you can go away,you dont have to bear the brunt of it day in and day out,faulkner
35817,35818,you owe nothing to them to mr compson s memory,i know you have never had any tenderness for jason,faulkner
35819,35820,you ve never tried to conceal it,dilsey said nothing,faulkner
35821,35822,she turned slowly and descended lowering her body from step to step as a small child does her hand against the wall,you go on and let him alone she said,faulkner
35823,35824,dont go in dar no mo now,i ll send luster up soon as i find him,faulkner
35825,35826,let him alone now,she returned to the kitchen,faulkner
35827,35828,she looked into the stove then she drew her apron over her head and donned the overcoat and opened the outer door and looked up and down the yard,the weather drove upon her flesh harsh and minute but the scene was empty of all else that moved,faulkner
35829,35830,she descended the steps gingerly as if for silence and went around the corner of the kitchen,as she did so luster emerged quickly and innocently from the cellar door,faulkner
35831,35832,dilsey stopped,whut you up to,faulkner
35833,35834,she said,nothin luster said,faulkner
35835,35836,mr jason say fer me to find out whar dat water leak in de cellar fum,en when wus hit he say fer you to do dat,faulkner

35841,35842,he stood aside and she peered down into the obscurity odorous of dank earth and mold and rubber,huh dilsey said,faulkner
35843,35844,she looked at luster again,he met her gaze blandly innocent and open,faulkner
35845,35846,i dont know whut you up to but you aint got no business coin hit,you jes tryin me too dis mawnin cause de others is aint you,faulkner

35851,35852,you git me another armful of wood while i got you,yessum he said,faulkner
35853,35854,he passed her on the steps and went to the woodpile,when he blundered again at the door a moment later again invisible and blind within and beyond his wooden avatar dilsey opened the door and guided him across the kitchen with a firm hand,faulkner
35855,35856,jes thow hit at dat box again she said,jes thow hit,faulkner
35857,35858,i got to luster said panting,i cant put hit down no other way,faulkner

35871,35872,yessum luster said,he vanished through the swing door,faulkner
35873,35874,dilsey put some more wood in the stove and returned to the bread board,presently she began to sing again,faulkner
35875,35876,the room grew warmer,soon dilsey s skin had taken on a rich lustrous quality as compared with that as of a faint dusting of wood ashes which both it and luster s had worn as she moved about the kitchen gathering about her the raw materials of food coordinating the meal,faulkner
35877,35878,on the wall above a cupboard invisible save at night by lamp light and even then evincing an enigmatic profundity because it had but one hand a cabinet clock ticked then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared its throat struck five times,eight oclock dilsey said,faulkner
35879,35880,she ceased and tilted her head upward listening,but there was no sound save the clock and the fire,faulkner
35881,35882,she opened the oven and looked at the pan of bread then stooping she paused while someone descended the stairs,she heard the feet cross the diningroom then the swing door opened and luster entered followed by a big man who appeared to have been shaped of some substance whose particles would not or did not cohere to one another or to the frame which supported it,faulkner
35883,35884,his skin was dead looking and hairless dropsical too he moved with a shambling gait like a trained bear,his hair was pale and fine,faulkner
35885,35886,it had been brushed smoothly down upon his brow like that of children in daguerrotypes,his eyes were clear of the pale sweet blue of cornflowers his thick mouth hung open drooling a little,faulkner
35887,35888,is he cold,dilsey said,faulkner
35889,35890,she wiped her hands on her apron and touched his hand,ef he aint i is luster said,faulkner

35893,35894,miss cahline say ef you aint got time to fix her hot water bottle to never mind about hit,oh lawd dilsey said,faulkner
35895,35896,she drew a chair into the corner between the woodbox and the stove,the man went obediently and sat in it,faulkner
35897,35898,look in de dinin room and see whar i laid dat bottle down dilsey said,luster fetched the bottle from the diningroom and dilsey filled it and gave it to him,faulkner
35899,35900,hurry up now she said,see ef jason wake now,faulkner
35901,35902,tell em hit s all ready,luster went out,faulkner
35903,35904,ben sat beside the stove,he sat loosely utterly motionless save for his head which made a continual bobbing sort of movement as he watched dilsey with his sweet vague gaze as she moved about,faulkner
35905,35906,luster returned,he up he said,faulkner
35907,35908,miss cahline say put hit on de table,he came to the stove and spread his hands palm down above the firebox,faulkner

35945,35946,she went to the diningroom where they heard her moving about then she returned and set a plate at the kitchen table and set food there,ben watched her slobbering making a faint eager sound,faulkner
35947,35948,all right honey she said,here yo breakfast,faulkner
35949,35950,bring his chair luster,luster moved the chair up and ben sat down whimpering and slobbering,faulkner
35951,35952,dilsey tied a cloth about his neck and wiped his mouth with the end of it,and see kin you keep fum messin up his clothes one time she said handing luster a spoon,faulkner
35953,35954,ben ceased whimpering,he watched the spoon as it rose to his mouth,faulkner
35955,35956,it was as if even eagerness were musclebound in him too and hunger itself inarticulate not knowing it is hunger,luster fed him with skill and detachment,faulkner
35957,35958,now and then his attention would return long enough to enable him to feint the spoon and cause ben to close his mouth upon the empty air but it was apparent that luster s mind was elsewhere,his other hand lay on the back of the chair and upon that dead surface it moved tentatively delicately as if he were picking an inaudible tune out of the dead void and once he even forgot to tease ben with the spoon while his fingers teased out of the slain wood a soundless and involved arpeggio until ben recalled him by whimpering again,faulkner
35959,35960,in the diningroom dilsey moved back and forth,presently she rang a small clear bell then in the kitchen luster heard mrs compson and jason descending and jason s voice and he rolled his eyes whitely with listening,faulkner
35961,35962,sure i know they did nt break it jason said,sure i know that,faulkner
35963,35964,maybe the change of weather broke it,i dont see how it could have mrs compson said,faulkner
