573,574,i had given it to my mother a littl porcelain clock with a floral design of the kind she like that i bought for her in an antiqu shop in budapest on my way home one spring from visit friend in pragu,but i took it back silent,roth
575,576,littl by littl i took everyth back struck each time by how inconsequenti to him wa the sentiment the materi thing intend to betoken the love of those he most cherish,strang i would think to find that particular blank spot in a man on whom the claim of famili were so emot mayb not strang at all how could mere keepsak encapsul for him the overpow forc of blood bond,roth
577,578,item by item i took it all back like a welltrain refund clerk in a firstrat depart store but wonder if perhap what he wa think while he wrap these gift in old newspap and stuf them in carton of everi descript wa that thi way we wouldn t have too mani of hi possess to bother about after the funer,he could be a pitiless realist but i wasn t hi offspr for noth and i could be pretti realist too,roth
579,580,thi time instead of silent accept the good be return i remind him that i wa still a transient in a new york hotel didn t know when i d next be in connecticut and would just as soon have him hold on to the glass,take them he insist,roth
581,582,now there wa noth for him but to be frighten again,i wa sorri suddenli for not have let him have hi way and just taken the damn thing back to the hotel,roth
583,584,but i wa get frazzl too,i ve been like that all my life he said drop unhappili onto hi spot on the sofa,roth
585,586,at the age of eightysix with a massiv tumor in hi head better to continu wear at either side of hi bridl those blinder that had kept him pull hi load straight ahead all hi life,i wouldn t worri about it i said,roth
587,588,it isn t as if you re onli impuls,you can be cautiou and prudent too,roth
589,590,you oscil,what are you think i ask,roth
591,592,i gave my tefillin away,back when my father wa an overwork insur man be a jew for him hadn t had much to do with formal worship and like most of the firstgener american father in our neighborhood he visit the nearbi synagogu onli on the high holiday and when it wa necessari as a mourner,roth
593,594,and at home there were realli no ritual he observ,sinc hi retir howev and particularli in the last decad of my mother s life they had begun to attend servic togeth mostli everi friday night and though he still didn t go so far as to lay tefillin in the morn hi judaism wa more pointedli focus on the synagogu and the servic and the rabbi than it had been at ani time sinc hi childhood,roth
595,596,the templ wa a hundr or so yard down the road on a littl side street off north broad in an old hous that wa rent by the small congreg of elderli local peopl who were bare abl to meet the upkeep cost,to my perhap becaus they couldn t afford anyon cantor wasn t even a jew but a bulgarian who work for a new york auction hous dure the week and for thi littl conclav of elizabeth jew on their sabbath,roth
597,598,after the servic wa over he sometim entertain them with song from yentl and fiddler on the roof,my father love the bulgarian s deep voic and consid him a buddi he also thought highli of the yeshiva student who came over from new york to lead their servic on the weekend a twentythreeyearold whom my father call rabbi most respect and spoke of as someth of a sage,roth
599,600,howev humbl their manifest these yearn for a formal religion in hi old age were inspir by someth far from hypocrisi or convent decorum in fact the consol that he seem to deriv from go to synagogu sens of uniti it bestow on hi long life and the communion with hi own mother and father he told me he felt hi get rid of the tefillin one of the more enigmat instanc of hi lifelong habit of relinquish rather than save the treasur object of the past,given the link of sentiment that jewish belief now seem to furnish between the isol of old age and the strive popul life that wa all but gone i could have imagin him instead of part with hi tefillin rediscov in the mere contempl of them someth of their ancient fetishist power,roth
601,602,but my imagin thi old man medit fondl hi longneglect tefillin wa so much sentiment kitsch realli a scene out of some jewish parodi of wild strawberri,how my father actual dispos of the tefillin reveal an imagin altogeth bolder and more mysteri inspir by a person symbol mytholog as eccentr as beckett s or gogol s,roth
603,604,who d you give the tefillin to i ask him,who,roth
605,606,you know the y he said to me,the y,roth
607,608,i took the tefillin in a paper bag,the locker room wa empti i left them,roth
609,610,i m curiou i final said,how come you didn t go to the rabbi,roth
611,612,or wa i wrong about that too,mayb he d never even thought of the rabbi as perhap the shrug wa meant to it wa just reveal to him in a flash the knowledg that in that secret place where jewish men stood unashamedli nake befor one anoth he could lay hi tefillin to rest without worri the understand that where hi tefillin would come to no harm where they would not be profan or desecr where they might even be resanctifi wa in the midst of those familiar jewish belli and ball,roth
613,614,perhap what the act signifi wa not hi shame befor the young rabbiintrain but a declar that the men s locker room at the local ymha wa closer to the core of the judaism he live by than the rabbi s studi at the noth would have been more artifici than go with the tefillin to the rabbi even if the rabbi had been a hundr with a beard down to the ground,ye the locker room of the y where they undress they schvitz they stank where as men among men familiar with everi nook and cranni of their worndown old illshapen bodi they kibitz and told their dirti joke and where onc upon a time they d made their wa their templ and where they remain jew,roth
615,616,i didn t ask whi he hadn t turn them over to me,i didn t ask whi instead of give back to me all those napkin and tablecloth and place mat he hadn t given me the tefillin instead,roth
617,618,i wouldn t have pray with them but i might well have cherish them especi after hi death,but how wa he to know that,roth
619,620,he probabl thought i would have scof at the veri idea of hi hand on hi tefillin to and forti year earlier he would have been right,i didn t ask becaus i realiz that to do so wa truli to place the two of us back insid that corni scenario i couldn t seem to cut myself loos from,roth
621,622,somewhat improb where hi tefillin were concern it wa i whose imagin kept run to the predict maudlin while hi had the integr of a genuin anomal talent compel by the element feel that can lend ritualist intens to even the goofiest act,well i said when it wa clear that he had no more to tell me one of your pal there must have got a big surpris when he came up from the pool,roth
623,624,he must have thought a miracl had happen,there he had left hi shower clog in the bottom of hi locker and lo and behold they d been turn into tefillin,roth
625,626,i carri my suitcas from the baggag place all the way to the taxi s how good i felt,and the next morn my first morn in florida i woke up and thi had happen in my sleep yet again he wa push the fallen cheek up with hi fingertip to see if thi time it would stay,roth
627,628,i look in the mirror i see my face and i knew my life would never be the same,whi he hadn t thought to give seth or jonathan the tefillin wa easier to understand than whi he hadn t thought to pass them on to me,roth
629,630,my nephew rais in a secular etho with no knowledg of judaism were jew in name alon my father like my mother ador them worri about them prais them lavish on them gift of a good deal more advic than they wish to he knew better than to expect them to know what the tefillin were let alon to want to own them,as for my brother my father probabl imagin that sandi would have been as unrecept as i to such a bequest though my guess is that sandi might have been touch by that memento not becaus of it religi signific but as a solid piec of our past as someth that he rememb as i did see neatli store for year and year in a velvet bag in a drawer of the dine room breakfront in the apart where we had grown up,roth
631,632,but our father be our father couldn t have been expect to understand that,he understood like the rest of us onli what he understood though that he understood fierc,roth
633,634,i could no longer enter my father s bedroom without rememb the night just after my mother s after i had arriv from london that afternoon i had slept with him in hi doubl bed,sandi and helen had gone to sleep at sandi s suburban hous in englewood cliff where seth and jon now young work men were still live but which sandi plan to sell shortli sinc hi job had alreadi reloc him in chicago,roth
635,636,in may at seventynin my father wa in excel health and impress vigor but twentyfour hour after hi wife die in that seafood restaur he look almost as bad as he did now disfigur by the tumor,that first night togeth befor bed i had given him milligram of valium and a glass of warm milk to wash the tablet down,roth
637,638,he disapprov of tranquil and sleep pill critic vehement anyon who reli on of on willpow the way he begin that night and for the next few week he accept the valium without ani question when i said it would help him to sleep though later perhap to eas hi conscienc he refer to the drug he d taken as dramamin,we took turn in the bathroom and then in our pajama we lay down side by side in the bed where he had slept with my mother two night befor the onli bed in the apart,roth
639,640,after turn off the light i reach out and took hi hand and held it as you would the hand of a child who is frighten of the dark,he sob for a minut or i heard the broken heavi breath of someon veri deepli asleep and i turn over to tri to get some rest myself,roth
641,642,thirti minut later have taken no valium i wa lie there wide awak when on the night tabl besid me the phone rang,i grab it so that my father s sleep wouldn t be disturb and heard someon laugh at the other end,roth
643,644,who is thi i ask but the answer wa more crazi laughter,i hung up uncertain whether the call wa a fluke wrong number or deliber the work of some ghoul who follow the obituari page in the local paper where my mother s death had been report that morn and then phone the famili of the dead at night to get hi kick,roth
645,646,when the phone rang again less than a minut luminesc clock radio still show knew it wa no innoc wrong number,there again wa the viciou laugh of one who ha triumph over an enemi the gleeful sadism of a victori aveng,roth
647,648,after put down the receiv i got out of bed and ran to the live room extens to take the receiv there off the hook befor the phone rang a third time,i left it like that until around six the next morn when i got up and stole back into the live room to replac it so that my father wouldn t ask ani question,roth
649,650,i wa in the bathroom when it rang around seven,my father answer,roth
651,652,when i came out and ask who had phone so earli he said angrili no one but it wa clear enough what had happen,who wa it i repeat and thi time he describ the laugh he d heard,roth

687,688,i did what you told me he said,flip through the save book i saw that the save ad up to about fifti thousand dollar the cd and municip came to anoth thirti too were to be left to my brother,roth
689,690,the tenthousanddollar insur polici goe to you he said,when i wa visit him in florida some two or three year after my mother s death the subject of hi will had come up and i had told him to leav all hi money to sandi to split as he wish between hi two kid and himself,roth
691,692,i told him that i didn t need ani money and that what seth and jonathan got could make a big differ to them if the money wa divid two way or three at the most,i had meant it when i said it i had confirm it in a letter to him afterward and i hadn t thought about hi will sinc,roth

695,696,admittedli it wa also a characterist attempt to take the moral high ground within the famili to defin myself in my fifti as i had in colleg and graduat school and later as a young writer as a son to whom materi consider were larg i felt crush for have done it naiv and foolish and crush,to my great dismay stand with him over hi last will and testament i discov that i want my share of the financi surplu that against all odd had been accumul over a lifetim by thi obdur resolut father of mine,roth
697,698,i want the money becaus it wa hi money and i wa hi son and i had a right to my share and i want it becaus it wa if not an authent chunk of hi hardwork hide someth like the embodi of all that he had overcom or outlast,it wa what he had to give me it wa what he had want to give me it wa due me by custom and tradit and whi couldn t i have kept my mouth shut and allow what wa onli natur to prevail,roth
699,700,didn t i think i deserv it,did i consid my brother and hi children more deserv inheritor than i perhap becaus my brother by have given him grandchildren wa more legitim a father s heir than wa the son who had been childless,roth

971,972,four word again veri veri basic stuff but that night after joanna had done me the favor of hear me out it sound like all the wisdom in the world to me,i didn t understand anyth,roth
973,974,as i d driven back to manhattan that afternoon with my grandfath s shave mug clutch in one hand certainli noth could have been clearer to me than how littl i knew,it wasn t that i hadn t understood that the connect to him wa convolut and i hadn t known wa how deep deep can be,roth
975,976,i slept fit till four in the morn then i turn on the light got out of bed and look at the pictur of hi brain again understand noth about that either,had it been the mri of yorick s brain that hamlet had been look at even he might have been speechless,roth
977,978,a few day later we got the second opinion and my father prefer it to the first,vallo benjamin a neurosurgeon at nyu hospit in manhattan had agre to fit us in at the request of david krohn who had describ him to me as worldclass benjamin wa an authorit worldli man of about my age a smartli dress darkey foreign viril goodlook in the forthright school of picasso whom he resembl,roth
979,980,he listen to the medic histori my father recount ask if he got headach or dizzi spell then touch the point of a pin to the two side of my father s face to determin how much feel he d lost on the bad side,benjamin look to be scrutin him veri care as my father answer all the question ask hi own question and wait to hear if a stay of execut might be grant and hi sentenc lift leav him free to feel as though he were forti again,roth
981,982,i feel like forti wa someth he d told everyon even on day when it wasn t true until just a few month back,benjamin stuck the mri pictur of the brain up on the light screen behind hi desk and told me to come around and take a look at them with him,roth
983,984,my father sat docil besid lil hold in hi hand hi piec of paper with the list of question while the doctor speak so softli that onli i could hear trace a finger over the pictur to show me the extens of the tumor,strictli speak he said it wasn t a brain tumor,roth
985,986,probabl it had begun as a tumor on a facial nerv and grown to where now it wa not onli push against the brain stem but extrud through the bone at the back of the nose,meyerson had estim that it would take eight to ten hour to oper and had call the oper routin,roth
987,988,now i wa told that it would more like take thirteen or fourteen hour and that the oper involv work where all the arteri and nerv are mass tricki terrain the doctor said,are you tell me it s imposs i ask him,roth
989,990,not at all he snap back as though i had impugn hi expertis,hi brotherinlaw had a tumor like thi and they radiat it,roth
991,992,use radiat and it went away,i m not say that would solv everyth be perman,roth
993,994,roth he repli veri gentli i don t know if radiat would be effect until i know the kind of tumor we re deal with,to know that i need in addit to these pictur a cat scan to give us a pictur of the skull as well as the situat with the brain,roth
995,996,i then need a biopsi of the tumor,the biopsi is done with a needl the doctor told him,roth
997,998,it s a procedur that take no more than an hour,i would recommend that you come into the hospit overnight so that we can watch you afterward,roth
999,1000,my father s unembellish style and the fight that wa obvious still in him despit hi age and all he wa up against seem somewhat to beguil the sophist neurosurgeon and even to touch some chord of person sympathi,sever time in recount the histori of hi ill my father had veer off into an anecdot out of hi newark childhood some seventyf year earlier a narr whose subterranean messag appear to be that he had learn to be realist on rutger street and wa prepar for whatev befel him now,roth
1001,1002,he and life went way way back togeth and he want benjamin to know that too,to each about stand up to the irish ruffian from down neck in newark or work after school in hi cousin s blacksmith doctor listen with nearli as much curios as impati and he kindli wait to steer him back to the busi at hand until my father had illustr hi point,roth
1003,1004,then he explain to him in detail how the needl would be insert up through the roof of the mouth the tissu remov from the tumor with the needl and so on step by step,and radiat my father ask again a littl desper thi time,roth
1005,1006,the biopsi will determin if it is the kind of tumor that respond to radiat,the origin request for a coupl more year had in a matter of minut been extend to three or four i notic,roth
1007,1008,my father wa obvious come to trust and even to imbu with a certain divin might thi doctor who wa at onc so much more patrician and potentlook than haimish heavyset dr,meyerson who had propos to do rather more than stick a needl up through the roof of hi mouth,roth
1009,1010,it occur to me that if we were all to sit and talk togeth in benjamin s offic for anoth day or two my father would eventu overcom hi fear of call down even wors miseri upon himself by appear sin greedi and proclaim to thi doctor what had to be in hi heart which wa that he want not just three or four year more but to tackl the whole damn thing all over again i rais myself up out of the immigr street without even a high school educ i never knuckl under never broke the law never lost my courag or said i quit i wa a faith husband a loyal american a proud jew i gave two wonder boy everi opportun i myself never had and what i am demand is onli what i eightysix year,whi he would ask him should a man die at all and of cours he would have been right to ask,roth

1021,1022,weren t you he ask lil,i m sure he s an excel doctor,roth
1023,1024,and he said wait,what is he my father ask me,roth

2587,2588,i did not want to leav brenda s side that morn and for a while i play with the littl point at the nape of her neck where she d had her hair cut,i stay longer than i should have and when final i return to my room i almost ran into ron who wa prepar for hi day at patimkin kitchen and bathroom sink,roth
2589,2590,so we would be with each other until the summer s last moment,thi should have made me overjoy but as brenda trot back down the stair to accompani her famili to the they were to pick up wa not joy but disturb as i had been more and more with the thought that when brenda went back to radcliff that would be the end for me,roth
2591,2592,i wa convinc that even miss winney s stool wa not high enough for me to see clear up to boston,nevertheless i toss my cloth back into the drawer and wa abl final to tell myself that there d been no hint of end our affair from brenda and ani suspicion i had ani uneasi wa spawn in my own uncertain heart,roth

2609,2610,the fact of her departur had of cours been on my mind for a while but overnight it had taken on a darker hue,curious the dark seem to have someth to do with harriet ron s intend and i thought for a time that it wa simpli the realiti of harriet s arriv that had dramat the pass of time we had been talk about it and now suddenli it wa as brenda s departur would be here befor we knew it,roth
2611,2612,but it wa more than that the union of harriet and ron remind me that separ need not be a perman state,peopl could marri each other even if they were young,roth
2613,2614,and yet brenda and i had never mention marriag except perhap for that night at the pool when she d said when you love me everyth will be all right well i love her and she me and thing didn t seem all right at all,or wa i invent troubl again,roth

8965,8966,of cours i am sure the great major of american realiz that there is alway go to be a small vocal minor of cavil and critic who are never go to be satisfi no matter how perfectli balanc the restraint and the firm with which we deal with civil disrupt of thi kind,even if there should be onli one person dead over a twoday period or as littl as half a person a day even if over a twoday period there should be onli one person who is slightli maimedthes critic will begin to talk as though the tragedi wa nt the overwhelm danger to which ten of thousand of our brave soldier were subject but the maim of one person out of onli ten thousand and what is more than like an outoftown who unlik our brave soldier had onli to remain at home to stay out of harm s way,roth
8967,8968,well to thi small vocal minor let me make one thing veri clear,i too have great sympathi for the famili of the three boy scout who were kill here in washington,roth
8969,8970,i am a father and i know full well how import children can be to a man s career and incident in that connect a wife,i am proud to say that my wife and my daughter were prepar to work far into the night in order that famili less fortun than our own might have some small comfort in their hour of need,roth
8971,8972,nor do we intend to forget these peopl when christma time roll around,but let there be no mistak about it quick on the trigger as i may be with compass for the innoc famili i am equal swift in my condemn of these three guilti scout,roth
8973,8974,and i say guilti becaus if they were not guilti they would not be dead,that is not the kind of countri we live in,roth
8975,8976,now i know there are those apologist for the boy scout upris who have attempt to arous sympathi for the three guilti scout by point out that while one had attain the rank of eagl scout the other two were onli tenderfoot,but what of the two tenderfoot they ask,roth
8977,8978,how could two littl tenderfoot pose so seriou a threat to our nation secur as to make it necessari to kill them,well let me answer that question my fellow american by show you the weapon that were found conceal hang from the belt of these two littl tenderfoot scout when their bodi were search by the fbi the secret servic the cia the militari polic the shore patrol the attorney gener s offic the capitol polic forc the polic forc of the district of columbia as well as by law enforc offic summon from around the countri to guarante the probiti and thorough of thi investig,roth
8979,8980,now i am sure that we all still rememb with a sad and mourn heart the italian carbin rifl purchas for from a chicago mailord hous by presid charisma s assassin lee harvey oswald whom i mention earlier in connect with jame earl ray and charl curti flood,in the mailord catalog that rifl probabl did not appear to be ani more sophist than the weapon i am about to show you now or ani more capabl of chang the cours of histori,roth
8981,8982,but let there be no mistak about it it is just as effect if not more so,firstli wherea the rifl that destroy presid charisma s polit career measur forti inch overal thi knife that i hold here in my hand measur with the blade sheath onli four and fiveeighth inch,roth
8983,8984,thi make it an ideal weapon to use in public place as oppos to a fortyinch rifl which might arous suspicion on a school bu or in a supermarket or ani of the hundr place where you and your love one find yourselv in the cours of an ordinari day,secondli it is a far more viciou weapon than an ordinari rifl and needless to say doe not even begin to approach in human a simpl thousandpound bomb let alon a nuclear ex plosiv,roth
8985,8986,as one who wa rais as a quaker you know i have a particularli strong interest in be human,that is whi sinc come to offic i have done everyth i can to get congress to appropri money for a weapon system that would make us number one in the world in that depart,roth
8987,8988,now that is the type of death peopl have dream about for themselv sinc time immemori and let it not be record that trick e dixon lack the moral and spiritu ideal to address himself to that dream,but now let me ask you thi my fellow american,roth
8989,8990,what could be further from the kind of painless death for men everywher that thi administr is work so hard to bring about than that which is experienc by the victim of a knife such as i am hold in my hand,not onli is it necessari to deliv as mani as five to ten horrifyingli pain stab wound in order to kill somebodi with a weapon thi small but in order to accomplish thi the murder must exhibit a sustain vicious a coldblood determin to kill that i assur you would shock and appal a combattri bomber pilot no less than it doe you and me,roth
8991,8992,whi els would they use a weapon that take up to half an hour to do the sort of job our pilot accomplish in a split second and without the groan and the gore,now let s look at the knife close,roth
8993,8994,am go to open out the blade one by one and describ to you the purpos and function of each,you should not be misl by it fourandfiveeighthsinch exterior into imagin that it is simpli an instrument design to kill,roth
8995,8996,like so mani of the weapon carri by guerrilla revolutionari around the world it ha multipl use of which murder of the agon and sadist varieti is but one,let s begin here with the smallest of the four blade,roth
8997,8998,in the languag of those who employ such weapon it is known as the bottl open,i ll tell you how it got that name in a moment,roth
8999,9000,you will observ that it is hookshap at the end and measur one inch and oneeighth,it is employ dure the interrog of prison primarili to goug out one or both of the eye,roth
9001,9002,last but not least it is sometim insert into the mouth of a prison who will not talk in order to slit the flesh at the upper part of the larynx between the vocal cord,that open up there is call the glotti and bottl open is deriv from glottal open the pet name origin attach to the blade by it most coldblood practition,roth
9003,9004,thi second largest blade measur one inch and threequart taper to a point and probabl look to you to be a miniatur bayonet,do not be fool by appear,roth
9005,9006,it ha noth to do with bayonet such as those our brave soldier found it necessari to fix to their rifl in selfdefens dure the twoday boy scout upris,thi littl blade is known as the leather punch and far from be an instrument of selfdefens it is yet anoth tortur devic along the line of the bottl open,roth
9007,9008,as it name suggest it is use to punch hole in human flesh or leather as the flesh is call by revolutionari who consid their enemi to be no more than anim,it will come as no surpris to you to learn that it is most frequent driven into the palm of the hand much the same way that the nail were in the movi the greatest stori ever told,roth
9009,9010,it is known as the screwdriv,tradit it is insert into the groov between the nail and the flesh and turn in a rotari fashion like so,roth
9011,9012,howev we know from intellig report that the screwdriv may also on occas be introduc into bodili apertur of which the nostril and the ear are the onli one i shall choos to make mention of on nationwid televis,some of my polit oppon may think otherwiseand they have everi right to disagre with my positionbut i for one have never believ it necessari to use bad languag to make my point and i have no intent of resort to those kind of tactic in the midst of a major address to the nation,roth
9013,9014,thi last blade of the four is probabl the one you re most familiar with from your nightmar,two inch and threequart in length ninesixteenth of an inch at it widest point it ha a sharp cut edg that i shall demonstr for you on thi piec of paper,roth
9015,9016,incident it is no accid that print on thi piec of paper is the preambl to the constitut the bill of right and the oftquot and much belov ten command with their famou thou shalt not,i do nt think i am too far afield when i say that what you see print on thi sheet of paper closeup of paper is just about everyth we believ in and cherish as a peopl,roth
9017,9018,i want you to watch as i demonstr what thi blade can do in a matter of second to all that you and i hold near and dear,he slice the piec of paper into oneinch strip and then hold them up for the audienc to see of cours you can peel appl with a blade like thi you can slice your potato for fri and you can cut up your cucumb radish tomato onion and celeri for salad,roth
9019,9020,and i am sure that those who would seek to exoner these three scout will maintain that it wa onli to prepar a delici salad such as i describ that they secret these weapon upon their belt and carri them hundr of mile across state line to the nation s capit,i am afraid that whether it is knifecarri boy scout or cardcarri communist there will alway be a hand of apologist around to come to their defens,roth
9021,9022,my fellow american i want to leav it to you and not to the apologist to decid,i ask you to look at thi fourprong instrument of tortur,roth
9023,9024,i ask you to look at what just one of those blade wa abl to do to the preambl to the constitut the bill of right and the belov ten command,and now i ask you if you think there is anyth at all to be said in defens of three boy scout carri such knive into the nation s capit,roth
9025,9026,and incident in that connect these were not the onli three boy scout in washington bear conceal weapon on their belt,these were onli the three we happen to kill,roth
9027,9028,in all a total of eight thousand four hundr and sixtythre knive each resembl thi one in everi last detail were confisc dure the two day the scout were here,that mean a grand total of thirtythre thousand eight hundr and fiftytwo blade or enough blade to tortur simultan everi singl resid of chevi chase maryland includ women and children,roth
9029,9030,now you ask how did we prevent thi bloodbath from take place in chevi chase,the answer is by set up an enclos camp site for the scout who were not shot,roth
9031,9032,and let me tell you someth it is to the veri great credit of the scout movement in thi countri that onc we were abl to get these boy off the street and into a rug camp situationand we have the polic to thank for volunt their help in get all the boy out therethey show themselv worthi in everi way of their famou motto be prepar,let s take a look at just a few of their accomplish first in the absenc of toilet facil they did a tremend job in dispos of their wast matter and the leav they use for person hygien,roth
9033,9034,next what littl water they had in their canteen they share in an admir way or so it would seem from the fact that not a singl one of the nearli ten thousand die of thirst,nor did they make the mistak of drink from or even dare to bath in the pond at the campsit,roth
9035,9036,so familiar were they with the danger sign of sewag and stagnat,as for eat well i m proud to say that by morn they had discov edibl root and berri we did nt even know were there,roth
9037,9038,and as for warmth as you could expect they manag dure the night to start sever fire in the classic boy scout manner of rub two stick togeth,in all what might have been a nightmar for the citizen of chevi chase maryland wa convert into wonder scout experi for the boy themselv and one that i m sure they ll rememb for a long time to come,roth
9039,9040,i know that when the polic van return thi morn to take them away mani of the boy were reluct to leav the campsit,so anxiou were some to spend anoth night under the star and away from the socal comfort of civil such as medic attent lawyer telephon and food that it wa necessari for the polic to chase after them and liter drag them off the premis and into the wait truck,roth
9041,9042,with fewer and fewer opportun avail to our youth for rough it thi administr natur take pride in what we were abl to do for these youngster last night,now i know that mani of you out there across the countri are ask yourselv whi i should be make such a gener offer to the scout,roth
9043,9044,whi do i prais them for their behavior at the campsit,whi am i will to forgiv these youngster and give them anoth chanc to make a decent start in life,roth
9045,9046,it must seem to those of you who saw the scout wave their sign here in the street of the nation s capitalsign offens and insult not onli to me but what is far wors to my innoc familythat i more than anyon have a right to harbor a grievanc against these ten thousand boy scout and particularli against the three who are now dead and will never be abl to come to me like respons children and apolog for tri to smear my reput,whi you may ask am i so compassion judici charit toler and wise when it wa my veri own polit career that stood to be most damag by these sign,roth
9047,9048,well those are good and intellig question,let me tri to answer them as forthrightli as i know how,roth
9049,9050,oh sure somebodi els might tri to make polit capit out of a vendetta against these youngster call them hoodlum and bum and rotten appl but i am afraid i am just too big a man for that,as far as i am concern these boy have learn their lesson as they prove at the campsit and that goe for the three dead scout as well,roth
9051,9052,even if those three dead boy do nt come and apolog as far as i am concern the past is past and i for one am will to forgiv and forget,for make no mistak about it while it is true that i am strongli oppos to permiss i am just as oppos to vindict,roth
9053,9054,i no more believ in punish a wrongdoer to excess than i would subscrib to the liber philosophi that allow a crimin to go merrili on hi way after he ha commit a crime,but of even greater import i just do nt think we ever cure a diseas by treat one of it symptom,roth
9055,9056,rather we must get to the caus of the ill,and certainli you know as well as i do that the caus of america s problem is not the boy scout of america,roth
9057,9058,nobodi is ever go to believ that and that is whi i do nt even attempt to make a case for it,they are just anoth group of american youngster who have fallen prey to that small dedic band of malcont and revolutionari who are out to destroy our countri by destroy our most import natur resourc of all our wonder youth,roth
9059,9060,and unless we cut these sourc of contagion from our societi as swiftli and thoroughli as we would excis a cancer from a live bodyand i know we are all unit in our opposit to cancer democrat and republican alikethi diseas that ha spread even to the boy scout will grow in virul until it ha infect everi last child in the land includ your own,and so long as i am presid i am not go to stand idli by while the children of thi countri come down with cancer leukemia or incident in that connect muscular dystrophi,roth
9061,9062,no it is not the boy scout of america but the man who incit them to thi riot by tamper with their moral who must be made to take the punish that come to all who would corrupt the youth of our nation,and that man my fellow american is the veri same fugit for whom the propornographi govern in copenhagen is provid refug at thi moment,roth
9063,9064,we all know howev the tremend influenc that major leagu basebal player have over the mind and heart of the young boy of thi nation,i am sure that anyon who rememb how he himself idol the great ballplay of hi youth will not even need the evid in order to imagin just how charl curti flood might misus and mislead these boy for hi own subvers end,roth
9065,9066,i am afraid that is all i can say to you tonight about the evid prove flood s guilt,as one who ha practic law i am particularli sensit to the constitut right which everi defend is entitl to,roth
9067,9068,and i certainli do not intend to endang the chanc of a convict by appear to tri thi fugit on nationwid tv,onc he is return to america he will be entitl to a fair trial despit what he ha done and by a juri that ha not been prejud against him by so august a person as the presid of the unit state of america,roth
9069,9070,right now as your presid my duti is to do everyth within my power to see that thi fugit from justic is return to our shore,of cours we have never expect of flood that he would voluntarili leav hi sanctuari in denmark given the kind of pleasur such a man might feel free to pursu in a countri with custom that are hardli those of our own,roth
9071,9072,on the contrari they have reject out of hand everi legitim request we have made of them,even now with the american armi mass on their border the american navi blockad their coast and the american marin firmli in control of hamlet s castl they continu to provid him with the same protect from the law that they provid to pornograph and filth peddler from around the globe,roth
9073,9074,i know that in the face of such profound contempt for american power and prestig the great major of american would agre that i have no choic but to order our troop onto danish soil so as to establish the dar,as the freeli elect govern in copenhagen,roth
9075,9076,howev i want to tell you thi becaus of my quaker background i have onli two hour ago made one last valiant effort to bring about a peac resolut of our differ with denmark,i am go to conclud my address to you tonight by recount in some detail the natur of that effort,roth
9077,9078,it is a stori of braveri and devot to countri that everi american will be proud of,my fellow american onli two hour befor come on televis to address you i gave the order as commanderinchief of the arm forc meet hi respons for a fleet of helicopt to make a surpris land on the larg danish island of zealand at a spot right here point onli twenti nautic mile from the capit of copenhagen,roth
9079,9080,now i realiz how danger such a gallant humanitarian effort might be,so did the brave green beret and ranger who volunt to carri it out,roth
9081,9082,not onli would they have to fli in at treetop level to avoid detect by the danish radar system but there wa no precis way of tell the exact size of the arsen that flood had manag to assembl with the approv if not the outright assist of the danish govern,would he resort to poison ga,roth
9083,9084,would he dare to employ tactic nuclear weapon,there wa no way in which our aerial photographi could penetr thi man s skull to see just how far he would go in violat the written and unwritten rule of warfar,roth
9085,9086,design to captur flood remov him by helicopt to elsinor and henc by militari jet to america the mission wa name by me oper courag and assign to joint conting task forc derringdo,it is with deep pride my fellow american that i can now tell you that oper courag ha been carri out to perfect exactli in accord with the meticul rehears schedul drawn up beforehand,roth
9087,9088,first off the danger flight from elsinor to the land site wa made in twentytwo minut and fourteen second precis accord to the plan,next the hazard search of the farmhous the outbuild and the till acreag wa accomplish in thirtyfour minut and eighteen second in other word with two full second to spare,roth
9089,9090,the ticklish evacu proceed requir precis the seven minut call for in the schedul and the dare return flight to elsinor at treetop level wa accomplish in twentytwo minut flat,moreov our forc return to safeti without sustain a singl casualti,roth
9091,9092,as at elsinor the enemi wa so complet taken by surpris that they did not fire a singl shot,i am proud to tell you that the intellig on oper courag wa equal as impress as the splitsecond time with which thi peril mission wa accomplish,roth
9093,9094,first the seven blondhair femal who were identifi on the aerial photo move in and out of the farmhous at all hour of the day were present at the time of the land,they were found as expect in bed scatter throughout the hous and taken immedi into custodi for interrog by the green beret as wa the coupl claim to be their father and mother,roth
9095,9096,the blondhair femal found in the bed in variou stage of undress rang in age from seven to eighteen,second the dark round object visibl in the aerial photograph and identifi posit by intellig as watermelon were no longer in the field or patch at the time of the land nor wa there evid ani longer of the watermelon vine themselv,roth
9097,9098,thi ha led intellig to conclud that onli hour befor the raid the telltal watermelon were remov and replac with the ordinari rock and potato plant found at the time of the land,as for the larg dark object identifi as charl curti flood himself appar at the veri last minut he too wa replac with a big black labrador dog,roth
9099,9100,thi wa verifi when the dog wa found romp in the veri field where photograph taken the previou night reveal the fugit exercis by moonlight,it is to the great credit of the command in charg of oper courageand repres the highest order of dedic and professionalismthat in order to keep faith to the plan the dog wa taken into custodi in precis the same amount of time as had been allot for the captur of flood,roth
9101,9102,she wa then transport in the command helicopt bound and under heavi guard to hamlet s castl at elsinor,howev onc the helicopt touch safe clown i immedi gave the order from the white hous that the interrog of the dog wa to be suspend and that she wa to be releas from her bind and allow to roam on a leash in a grassi enclosur on the castl ground,roth
9103,9104,now it had been my hope that i could come befor you tonight to tell you that flood wa in the custodi of american offici and that it would not be necessari to take further measur against a recalcitr and contemptu danish govern in order to secur hi releas,and make no mistak about it,roth
9105,9106,if we were not deal with a man so viciou that he would rather risk the life of an innoc femal dog than hi own i could have done just that,howev even though they were unabl to apprehend the fugit at thi time i should still like to take thi opportun to pay a tribut to the skill courag and devot with which joint conting task forc derringdo carri out oper courag,roth
9107,9108,the flawless fashion in which they execut thi delic secret mission wa inspir to all american,and sure it must be account the most success singl oper of it kind stage thu far in the danish crisi,roth
9109,9110,the embarrass alon that we have caus copenhagen by point up the hole in their radar system will inevit have a profound effect upon the moral of the danish peopl and their arm forc,ye they were written with a quill pen on a piec of parchment hundr and hundr of year ago but probabl never have they been so true as they are tonight,roth
9111,9112,littl did the immort bard know then how prophet those word would be in the centuri to come,my fellow american here tricki rise from hi chair to sit on the edg of hi desk someth is rotten in denmarklet there be no mistak about it,roth
9113,9114,and if it ha now fallen to american boy to step in and erad the rotten that danish boy are unabl to step in and erad i know they will not hesit to do so,make fist becaus we will not watch as the oncegreat homeland of hamlet slip down the drain of deprav,roth
9115,9116,look down instead with all the might that we can summon in our righteou caus we shall quick friendli glanc at ceil with god s help purg denmark of corrupt now and for all time,look for a moment into etern without bat eyelash thank you and good night,roth
9117,9118,my fellow american i am go to conclud my address with the word of a veri great man,we repeat thi bulletin,roth
9119,9120,trick e dixon is dead,that is all the inform we have at thi time,roth
9121,9122,the white hous ha refus to comment on an earlier bulletin announc that the presid of the unit state is dead,the white hous bilg secretari say there is no truth whatsoev to report of the presid s death but add that he will not categor deni the stori at thi time,roth
9123,9124,conflict stori continu to circul concern the death of the presid,a second white hous announc ha now call attent to the presid s schedul for the day point out that no mention is made there of die,roth
9125,9126,i think it would be best said the white hous bilg secretari in the light of these schedul to wait for a statement one way or anoth from the presid himself,report out of walter reed armi hospit now seem to confirm the earlier bulletin that the presid of the unit state is dead,roth
9127,9128,though the circumst surround hi death remain unclear it appear that the presid wa admit to walter reed late yesterday for surgeri,the purpos of the secret oper wa to remov the sweat gland from hi hip,roth
9129,9130,that is all we know at thi time,the vice presid ha flatli deni report of the presid s death,roth
9131,9132,here is a portion of the vice presid s remark made as he wa on hi way to address the nation yodel associ now thi is just the kind of reckless rot and rotten reckless that you can expect from the vile vilifi who are out to vilifi vile,what of the report mr,roth
9133,9134,vice presid that he had secretli enter walter reed last night to have the sweat gland remov from hi hip,hogwash and hokum,roth
9135,9136,and hooligan,and heinou,roth
9137,9138,i spoke to him onli five minut ago and found him fit as a fiddl,thi lachrymos lie is a lament lollapalooza launch by the lunat left,roth
9139,9140,unconfirm report from walter reed hospit now indic that the presid wa found dead at seven am,thi morn,roth
9141,9142,no word yet on the caus of death or where he wa found,specul mount that death came follow surgeri for the remov of sweat gland lodg in the hip,roth
9143,9144,then you are admit sir that he is dead,i did nt say that at all,roth
9145,9146,i said i just do nt think that hi death if it were to come about between now and the elect would affect hi popular with the great major of american,after all thi is nt the first time you peopl were readi to call him dead and here he is presid of the unit state,roth
9147,9148,but we meant dead polit,all i m say is that whether these rumor are true or fals is not go to affect our campaign plan by one iota,roth
9149,9150,i d even go so far as to say that if it turn out he actual is a corps our margin of victori in will be greater by far than what it wa in,how do you figur that mr,roth
9151,9152,chairman,well i for one just can not imagin the press of thi countri irrespons and viciou as it may be go after thi man dead and buri with the same kind of virul they use to go after him aliv,roth
9153,9154,furthermor as regard the voter themselv it would seem to me that there is a certain sympathi a certain warmth that a dead dixon is go to be abl to arous in the peopl of thi countri that he never realli wa abl to summon up when he wa live and breath and so on,if he is dead then you think it would be good for hi imag,roth
9155,9156,no doubt about it,i think that in term of exposur he may have gone about as far as he can aliv,roth
9157,9158,thi is probabl just the shot in the arm we ve been look for particularli if the democrat run teddi charisma,can you explain what you mean mr,roth
9159,9160,chairman,it s one thing you see for a candid for the presid to have two brother who are deadit s someth els when the incumb himself is dead,roth
9161,9162,i mean if experi is ani kind of criterionand i think it isi just do nt see how you can top the presid now where thi whole death issu is concern,mr,roth
9163,9164,chairman is there ani truth at all to the grow suspicion that you peopl are send up a trial balloon with these rumor of the presid s death,to see just how much polit mileag there is in it if ani,roth
9165,9166,that is on the one hand you yourself sound convinc that the presid s death would give a great boost to hi wane popular while vice presid whatshisnam assert that the presid is fit as a fiddl and that these rumor have been propag by the lunat left,look i have no intent of critic the alliter of the vice presid of the unit state of america,roth
9167,9168,under the constitut he ha a right to alliter just as much as ani other american citizen,i am speak to you boy strictli as parti chairman and all i am say in languag plain and simpl is that the presid ha absolut no intent of withdraw from the race for ani reason whatsoev includ hi own death,roth
9169,9170,thi is nt a lyin b johnson who toss in the towel becaus the countri hate hi gut and doe nt trust him as far as they can throw him,no you re not go to intimid trick e dixon just by hate him,roth
9171,9172,hell he s had that all hi life he s use to it,and you re not go to keep him off the ballot by kill him either,roth

9387,9388,how he wa remov from hi own room where he wa await surgeri on hi upper lip and forc or entic into a baggi is not known at thi time,there would seem to be littl doubt howev that the manner in which he ha been murder is directli relat to the controversi remark he made at san dementia on april in which he came out foursquar for the right of the unborn,roth
9389,9390,right now hospit offici seem to believ that the presid left hi bed voluntarili to accompani hi assail to the deliveri room perhap in the belief that he wa to be photograph there besid the stomach of a woman in labor,doubtless with the destruct of copenhagen and the occup of denmark success accomplish he wa anxiou to return to what he consid our most press domest problem,roth
9391,9392,rumor ha it that he intend in hi next major address to use hi new upper lip to outlin hi belief in the sanctiti of human life includ the life of the yet unborn,but now there will be no speech on the sanctiti of human life with the new lip he would have been so proud of,roth

9415,9416,becaus that s what the bilg secretari said it wa,whi would he give me a pictur of a hip and say it wa the presid s if it wa nt,roth
9417,9418,so stun are the peopl of thi great middl western metropoli that they seem total unabl to respond to the bulletin from washington that have come to them over radio and televis,and so from the gold coast to skid row from the fashion suburb of the north to the squalid ghetto of the south the scene is much the same peopl go about their ordinari everyday affair as though noth had happen,roth
9419,9420,not even the flag have been lower to halfstaff but continu to flutter high in the breez even as they did befor the news reach thi griefstricken citi of the terribl fate that ha befallen our leader,trick e dixon is dead cruelli and bizarr murder a martyr to the unborn the world roundand it is more than the mind or spirit of chicago can accept or understand,roth
9421,9422,and so throughout thi great citi life in a manner of speak goe onmuch as you see it directli behind me here in the worldfam loop,shopper rush to and fro,roth

9429,9430,if the peopl in the street of chicago are incredul you can well imagin the mood of the ordinari man in the pool here in trick e dixon s nativ state,in chicago they are simpli unabl to respond here it is even more heartrend,roth
9431,9432,the californian i have spoken withor tri to speak withar like noth so much as small children who have been confront with an event far beyond their emot rang of respons,all they can do when they learn the tragic news that trick e dixon ha been found stuf in a baggi is giggl,roth
9433,9434,to be sure there are the proverbi california wisecrack but by and larg it is giggl such as one might hear from perplex and bewild children that remain in one s ear long after the giggler himself ha live off the high board or driven away in hi sport car,here he is not just the presid here he is a friend and a neighbor one of them a healthi child of the sunlight of the beach and the blue pacif a wan who embodi all the robust and grandeur of america s golden state,roth
9435,9436,peter piou in lo angel,next ike iron in new york citi,roth
9437,9438,no one ever believ that trick e dixon wa belov in new york citi,ye he live here onc in thi fashion fifth avenu apart build directli behind me,roth
9439,9440,but few ever consid him a resid of thi citi so much as a refuge from washington bide hi time to return to public offic,nor did new yorker seem much impress when he assum the power of the presid in,roth
9441,9442,but now he is gone and all at onc the veri deep affect the love if you will for their former neighbor is everywher appar,of cours you have to know new yorker to be abl to penetr the outer shell of cynic and see the love beneath,roth
9443,9444,you had to look but you saw it today here in new york in the seem boredom and indiffer of a bu driver in the impati of a salesgirl in the anger over noth of a taxi driver in the weari of the homebound worker pack into the subway in the blank gaze of the drunk along the boweri in the haughti of a dowag refus to curb her dog on the fashion upper east side,you had to look but there it wa love for trick e dixon,roth
9445,9446,ye the bitter ironi is thi he had to die in a baggi befor new yorker could tender him that hardwon love that would have meant so much to him,but then it is a day of bitter ironi,roth
9447,9448,ike iron from griefstricken and perhap guiltridden fifth avenu in the citi of new york where he live like a stranger but ha die like a longlost son,no the ordinari sign of grief are clearli not suffici to express the emot that they feel at thi hour and so they pretend for the time be that it simpli ha not happen or they giggl with embarrass and disbelief or they attempt to hide beneath a gruff exterior the deep love for a fallen leader that smolder away within,roth
9449,9450,and what of the madman who perpetr thi deed,for that stori we return you to the headquart of the fbi in washington,roth
9451,9452,that s right we re pretti sure now it wa a madman who perpetr thi deed,and the scout,roth
9453,9454,the knife,the louisvil slugger,roth
9455,9456,i m talk now about the brain behind the whole thing,more accur the lack of brain,roth
9457,9458,you see that s realli our number one clueeveryth els asid thi wa a pretti stupid thing to do to the presid,there he is the presid and they do a stupid thing like thi,roth
9459,9460,now if thi is somebodi s idea of a practic joke well i for one do nt consid it funni,you re not just stuf anybodi into a baggi you re stuf the presid of the unit state,roth
9461,9462,what about the digniti of hi offic,if you have no respect for the man what about the offic,roth
9463,9464,that s what realli gravel me person,i mean what do you think the enemi of democraci would think if they saw the presid of the unit state all curl up nake like that,roth
9465,9466,well i ll tell you what they d think they could nt be happier,do you think then that the assassin wa an enemi of democraci as well as a madman,roth
9467,9468,i do,and as i said a practic joker,roth
9469,9470,and even if we do nt find him we ve got the boy scout from boston who confess to thi thing in reserv so i d say on the whole we re in much better shape than we were last time and are realli just wait a goahead from the white hous,we are privileg to have with us in the studio one of the most distinguish member of the hous of repres a lead republican statesman and a friend and confid to the late presid,roth
9471,9472,congressman fraud thi is a sorrow day in our nation s histori,oh it s a day that will live in infami there s no doubt about that in my mind,roth
9473,9474,i am in fact introduc a bill into congress to have it declar a day that will live in infami and celebr as such in come year,what you ve got here as chief heehaw at the fbi wa say is a real lack of respect for the offic of the presid,roth
9475,9476,what you ve got here in thi assassin is a veri disrespect person and i would agre probabl a madman to boot,do you have ani idea congressman whi the white hous continu at thi late hour to refus to confirm the stori of the assassin,roth
9477,9478,i think it goe without say that we re in a sensit area here and consequ they want to move cautious on thi whole thing,i think they want first off to gaug the public reaction here at home and then of cours there is the reaction around the world to consid,roth
9479,9480,on the one hand you ve got our alli who depend upon us for support and on the other hand you ve got our enemi who are alway on the lookout for some chink in our armor and if you keep all that in mind then i think you have to agre that in the long run it is probabl in the interest of our integr and our credibl to cover thi whole thing up,i would think that some such reason as that is go on behind the scene at the white hous right now,roth
9481,9482,ha the first ladi been notifi,oh of cours,roth
9483,9484,what wa her reaction,well she wa understand quit overcom in the first moment,roth
9485,9486,consequ her immedi reaction wa to note that the manner in which the assassin went about the assassin wa in extrem bad tast,she said she just had to wonder about the upbring of a person who would forget someth like that,roth
9487,9488,she said she did nt want to blame the assassin s famili until she knew all the fact but it wa clear she felt there probabl could have been a wee bit more attent given to good groom in hi hous when the assassin wa grow up,what do you think of that idea,roth
9489,9490,not veri much,can you explain,roth
9491,9492,well it just doe nt make ani sens,now he did nt have to do that you knowbut he did becaus he want the peopl to have all the fact,roth
9493,9494,so i just do nt see how you can fault him there,no i just ca nt see where somebodi is go to assassin the presid for a sound polici decis such as thi one and that even goe for a madman,roth
9495,9496,no he had the mandat of the peopl here lunat includ,and the mandat of the congress as well,roth
9497,9498,in their behalf howev let me say that even they would not be so reckless as to assassin the presid becaus of a differ of opinion over some thing like bomb site,i mean nobodi s perfect,roth
9499,9500,and by and larg i think you can say that in the end the mistak in judgment and so on shake themselv out and we pretti much destroy the place that need destroy,it seem to me in fact that as regard the destruct of copenhagen you ll find that even among the presid s staunchest critic in the senat there wa a sens that a decis of that magnitud simpli could nt have been arriv at lightli or arbitrarili,roth
9501,9502,i think most of the truli respons member of the congress feel as i do that have made a strong show of strength such as thi in scandinavia now we are not go to get ourselv bog down there later the way we did in southeast asia,so you see no connect between the someth is rotten in denmark speech and the assassin,roth

9609,9610,of cours none of it is worth the paper it s written on,some of it s kind of laughabl in fact it s so unprofession and obvious a slapdash lastminut job,roth
9611,9612,but still and all you got to give them credit for their fortitud,they grab hold of my men just like they had the good on themselv and actual tri to handcuff themselv to the offic with their own handcuff and get cart off to prison that way,roth
9613,9614,we ca nt park a squad car anywher without half a dozen of them jump into the back seat and scream take me to j edgar heehawand step on it,we re sort of humor them howev the best we can and the one who just wo nt quit we tell them to wait right where they are and we ll round them up later,roth

9811,9812,perhap that is what he wa to the rest of the world,but to we who knew him noth so majest or formal could begin to commun the kind of man he wa and the esteem in which he wa held,roth
9813,9814,becaus to us he wa not a leader in the ordinari senseh wa a leader in the extraordinari sens,i m go to ask that we bow our head again,roth
9815,9816,and how appropri that it is a name even a puppi could bear for we all rememb as much as anyth about him the deep rever he had for dog,the name wa a simpl one my friend,roth
9817,9818,the name wa tricki,ye to you to me and to all american for gener to come tricki he wa and tricki he shall be,roth
9819,9820,and now all head bow and everi eye close let us pray,oh god who alon art ever merci in spare of punish humbl we pray thee on behalf of thi servant a man call tricki,roth
9821,9822,for let there be no mistak about it we are engag in a deadli competit with the kingdom of righteous,i could not agre more with satan when he say that our goal is not just to keep wicked for ourselv but to extend it to all creation becaus that is hell s destini,roth

9825,9826,my disagr with satan then is not about the goal for hell but about the mean to reach those goal,now satan ha said that we are ahead in thi competit with righteous,roth
9827,9828,i can not agre with that apprais of the situat,as i look at hell today i believ that we are follow program of an outdat leadership,roth
9829,9830,i believ we are follow program mani of which have not work in the past and will not work in the futur,i say that the program and leadership that have fail under satan s administr are not the program and the leadership that hell need now,roth
9831,9832,i say that the damn and the doom do not want to go back to the polici of the garden of eden,i say that the son and daughter of disobedi deserv a devil of consumm deprav a devil who will devot himself not to old and wornout iniqu but to bold new program in evil that will overturn god s kingdom and plung men into etern death,roth
9833,9834,what we need down here is not just high hope,what we need is crafti wile and untir zeal,roth
9835,9836,in the field of execut leadership i believ it is essenti that the devil not onli set the tone but he also must lead he must act as he talk,frankli i do nt think thi is the kind of leadership we have been get,roth
9837,9838,now sinc my arriv i have travel to the veri edg of the outer dark,i have been down to the bottom of the bottomless pit,roth

10443,10444,he himself didn t say much then and there but often on the follow day he would find occas while sit around the motorpool offic where he wa suppli clerk to talk over some of the thing he had heard with sergeant hickey,to be sure he didn t swallow everyth thi lingelbach said that wa critic of america,roth
10445,10446,sergeant hickey wa perfectli right anybodi could make destruct critic anybodi could just go ahead and start knock thing left and right all day long to sergeant hickey s way of think if you didn t have someth construct to say then mayb you shouldn t say anyth at all especi if you happen to be wear the uniform and eat the chow and draw the pay check of the countri you thought wa so terribl and aw,roy agre that sergeant hickey wa perfectli right there were some guy in the world who would never be satisfi even if you fed them all day long with a silver spoon but still you had to give thi guy from boston not lingelbach who wa an outright loner and oddbal but bellwood a lot of credit for hi argument about the way they did thing in sweden,roth
10447,10448,roy agre right down the line with sergeant hickey and hi uncl julian about commun but as bellwood said social wa as differ from commun as day from night,and sweden wasn t even that socialist,roth
10449,10450,what had made roy begin to wonder if after hi discharg a person like himself might not be happi live in a place like sweden wa they had a high standard of live and it wa a real democraci with the four freedom but they weren t moneymad bellwood said the way peopl in america were which wasn t a critic it wa a fact and they didn t believ in war which roy didn t believ in either,actual if he hadn t just return from sixteen month in the aleutian he might have gone off and gotten himself a job as a deckhand aboard a freighter bound for sweden and onc there found some kind of good honest work and not in stockholm either but in some fish villag such as he had seen photograph of in holiday,roth
10451,10452,he might even have settl down there and marri a swedish girl and had swedish children and never have return to the unit state again,wouldn t that be someth,roth

10455,10456,probabl that s what got to the swede someth did,sergeant hickey who saw all the magazin befor they were put in the day room came into the offic one morn and announc that in the new issu of look it said that more peopl jump off of build in sweden than in ani outandout capitalist countri in the world,roth
10457,10458,when roy later brought thi up with bellwood he didn t realli have much to say in sweden s defens except to start quibbl over percentag,appar there wa a heck of a lot of gloom over there that bellwood hadn t mention and veri frankli for all roy s willing to sympath with their form of govern so long as it wa a democraci with free elect by and larg he would prefer at the end of a day s work to spend hi leisur time with peopl who knew how to relax and take it easi,roth
10459,10460,moder in all thing that wa hi motto,consequ he found that he would just as soon spend hi even at the sowerbi as hang around at home where he either had to keep the radio at a whisper becaus hi father wa upstair write some report for mr,roth

10467,10468,julian got a kick out of kid roy and roy got sort of a kick out of be kid sinc it realli put them on a buddi relationship,of cours sometim julian went too far with hi kid particularli the night roy had said he realli didn t think he could ever be satisfi as a human be unless he wa do someth creativ,roth
10469,10470,as it happen he wa onli repeat someth he had onc heard bellwood say but it appli equal as well to him even though he hadn t thought it up person,uncl julian howev chose deliber to miss the point and said it sound to him as though what roy need wa a good piec,roth
10471,10472,roy had laugh it off and tri to act nonchal even though hi aunt iren wa in the dine room where she could hear everi word they said,julian s sens of humor wasn t alway up roy s alley,roth
10473,10474,it wa one thing if you were in the barrack or the motorpool offic to say f thi and f that and anoth when there were women around,where uncl julian s languag wa concern roy felt hi father had hi strongest case,roth

12125,12126,they spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one head for the part of the ocean where he hope to find fish,the old man knew he wa go far out and he left the smell of the land behind and row out into the clean earli morn smell of the ocean,hemingway
12127,12128,he saw the phosphoresc of the gulf weed in the water as he row over the part of the ocean that the fishermen call the great well becaus there wa a sudden deep of seven hundr fathom where all sort of fish congreg becaus of the swirl the current made against the steep wall of the floor of the ocean,here there were concentr of shrimp and bait fish and sometim school of squid in the deepest hole and these rose close to the surfac at night where all the wander fish fed on them,hemingway
12129,12130,in the dark the old man could feel the morn come and as he row he heard the trembl sound as fli fish left the water and the hiss that their stiff set wing made as they soar away in the dark,he wa veri fond of fli fish as they were hi princip friend on the ocean,hemingway
12131,12132,he wa sorri for the bird especi the small delic dark tern that were alway fli and look and almost never find and he thought the bird have a harder life than we do except for the robber bird and the heavi strong one,whi did they make bird so delic and fine as those sea swallow when the ocean can be so cruel,hemingway
12133,12134,she is kind and veri beauti,but she can be so cruel and it come so suddenli and such bird that fli dip and hunt with their small sad voic are made too delic for the sea,hemingway
12135,12136,he alway thought of the sea as la mar which is what peopl call her in spanish when they love her,sometim those who love her say bad thing of her but they are alway said as though she were a woman,hemingway
12137,12138,some of the younger fishermen those who use buoy as float for their line and had motorboat bought when the shark liver had brought much money spoke of her as el mar which is masculin,they spoke of her as a contest or a place or even an enemi,hemingway
12139,12140,but the old man alway thought of her as feminin and as someth that gave or withheld great favour and if she did wild or wick thing it wa becaus she could not help them,the moon affect her as it doe a woman he thought,hemingway
12141,12142,he wa row steadili and it wa no effort for him sinc he kept well within hi speed and the surfac of the ocean wa flat except for the occasion swirl of the current,he wa let the current do a third of the work and as it start to be light he saw he wa alreadi further out than he had hope to be at thi hour,hemingway
12143,12144,i work the deep well for a week and did noth he thought,today i ll work out where the school of bonito and albacor are and mayb there will be a big one with them,hemingway
12145,12146,befor it wa realli light he had hi bait out and wa drift with the current,one bait wa down forti fathom,hemingway
12147,12148,the second wa at seventyf and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundr and one hundr and twentyf fathom,each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook insid the bait fish tie and sew solid and all the project part of the hook the curv and the point wa cover with fresh sardin,hemingway
12149,12150,each sardin wa hook through both eye so that they made a halfgarland on the project steel,there wa no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which wa not sweet smell and good tast,hemingway
12151,12152,the boy had given him two fresh small tuna or albacor which hung on the two deepest line like plummet and on the other he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been use befor but they were in good condit still and had the excel sardin to give them scent and attract,each line as thick around as a big pencil wa loop onto a greensap stick so that ani pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two fortyfathom coil which could be made fast to the other spare coil so that if it were necessari a fish could take out over three hundr fathom of line,hemingway
12153,12154,now the man watch the dip of the three stick over the side of the skiff and row gentli to keep the line straight up and down and at their proper depth,it wa quit light and ani moment now the sun would rise,hemingway
12155,12156,the sun rose thinli from the sea and the old man could see the other boat low on the water and well in toward the shore spread out across the current,then the sun wa brighter and the glare came on the water and then as it rose clear the flat sea sent it back at hi eye so that it hurt sharpli and he row without look into it,hemingway
12157,12158,he look down into the water and watch the line that went straight down into the dark of the water,he kept them straighter than anyon did so that at each level in the dark of the stream there would be a bait wait exactli where he wish it to be for ani fish that swam there,hemingway
12159,12160,other let them drift with the current and sometim they were at sixti fathom when the fishermen thought they were at a hundr,but he thought i keep them with precis,hemingway
12161,12162,onli i have no luck anymor,but who know,hemingway
12163,12164,mayb today,everi day is a new day,hemingway
12165,12166,it is better to be lucki,but i would rather be exact,hemingway
12167,12168,then when luck come you are readi,the sun wa two hour higher now and it did not hurt hi eye so much to look into the east,hemingway
12169,12170,there were onli three boat in sight now and they show veri low and far inshor,all my life the earli sun ha hurt my eye he thought,hemingway
12171,12172,yet they are still good,in the even i can look straight into it without get the black,hemingway
12173,12174,it ha more forc in the even too,but in the morn it is pain,hemingway
12175,12176,just then he saw a manofwar bird with hi long black wing circl in the sky ahead of him,he made a quick drop slant down on hi backswept wing and then circl again,hemingway
12177,12178,he s got someth the old man said aloud,he did not hurri and he kept hi line straight up and down,hemingway
12179,12180,but he crowd the current a littl so that he wa still fish correctli though faster than he would have fish if he wa not tri to use the bird,the bird went higher in the air and circl again hi wing motionless,hemingway
12181,12182,then he dove suddenli and the old man saw fli fish spurt out of the water and sail desper over the surfac,dolphin the old man said aloud,hemingway
12183,12184,it had a wire leader and a mediums hook and he bait it with one of the sardin,he let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern,hemingway
12185,12186,then he bait anoth line and left it coil in the shade of the bow,he went back to row and to watch the longwing black bird who wa work now low over the water,hemingway
12187,12188,as he watch the bird dip again slant hi wing for the dive and then swing them wildli and ineffectu as he follow the fli fish,the old man could see the slight bulg in the water that the big dolphin rais as they follow the escap fish,hemingway
12189,12190,the dolphin were cut through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water drive at speed when the fish drop,it is a big school of dolphin he thought,hemingway
12191,12192,they are widespread and the fli fish have littl chanc,the bird ha no chanc,hemingway
12193,12194,the fli fish are too big for him and they go too fast,he watch the fli fish burst out again and again and the ineffectu movement of the bird,hemingway
12195,12196,that school ha gotten away from me he thought,they are move out too fast and too far,hemingway
12197,12198,but perhap i will pick up a stray and perhap my big fish is around them,my big fish must be somewher,hemingway
12199,12200,the cloud over the land now rose like mountain and the coast wa onli a long green line with the gray blue hill behind it,the water wa a dark blue now so dark that it wa almost purpl,hemingway
12201,12202,as he look down into it he saw the red sift of the plankton in the dark water and the strang light the sun made now,he watch hi line to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he wa happi to see so much plankton becaus it meant fish,hemingway
12203,12204,the strang light the sun made in the water now that the sun wa higher meant good weather and so did the shape of the cloud over the land,but the bird wa almost out of sight now and noth show on the surfac of the water but some patch of yellow sunbleach sargasso weed and the purpl formal iridesc gelatin bladder of a portugues manofwar float close besid the boat,hemingway
12205,12206,it turn on it side and then right itself,it float cheer as a bubbl with it long deadli purpl filament trail a yard behind it in the water,hemingway
12207,12208,agua mala the man said,they were immun to it poison,hemingway
12209,12210,but men were not and when some of the filament would catch on a line and rest there slimi and purpl while the old man wa work a fish he would have welt and sore on hi arm and hand of the sort that poison ivi or poison oak can give,but these poison from the agua mala came quickli and struck like a whiplash,hemingway
12211,12212,the iridesc bubbl were beauti,but they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man love to see the big sea turtl eat them,hemingway
12213,12214,the turtl saw them approach them from the front then shut their eye so they were complet carapac and ate them filament and all,the old man love to see the turtl eat them and he love to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he step on them with the horni sole of hi feet,hemingway
12215,12216,he love green turtl and hawkbil with their eleg and speed and their great valu and he had a friendli contempt for the huge stupid loggerhead yellow in their armourpl strang in their lovemak and happili eat the portugues menofwar with their eye shut,he had no mystic about turtl although he had gone in turtl boat for mani year,hemingway
12217,12218,he wa sorri for them all even the great trunk back that were as long as the skiff and weigh a ton,most peopl are heartless about turtl becaus a turtl s heart will beat for hour after he ha been cut up and butcher,hemingway
12219,12220,but the old man thought i have such a heart too and my feet and hand are like their,he ate the white egg to give himself strength,hemingway
12221,12222,he ate them all through may to be strong in septemb and octob for the truli big fish,he also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where mani of the fishermen kept their gear,hemingway
12223,12224,it wa there for all fishermen who want it,most fishermen hate the tast,hemingway
12225,12226,but it wa no wors than get up at the hour that they rose and it wa veri good against all cold and gripp and it wa good for the eye,now the old man look up and saw that the bird wa circl again,hemingway
12227,12228,he s found fish he said aloud,no fli fish broke the surfac and there wa no scatter of bait fish,hemingway
12229,12230,but as the old man watch a small tuna rose in the air turn and drop head first into the water,the tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had drop back into the water anoth and anoth rose and they were jump in all direct churn the water and leap in long jump after the bait,hemingway
12231,12232,they were circl it and drive it,if they don t travel too fast i will get into them the old man thought and he watch the school work the water white and the bird now drop and dip into the bait fish that were forc to the surfac in their panic,hemingway
12233,12234,the bird is a great help the old man said,just then the stern line came taut under hi foot where he had kept a loop of the line and he drop hi oar and felt the weight of the small tuna s shiver pull as he held the line firm and commenc to haul it in,hemingway
12235,12236,the shiver increas as he pull in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of hi side befor he swung him over the side and into the boat,he lay in the stern in the sun compact and bullet shape hi big unintellig eye stare as he thump hi life out against the plank of the boat with the quick shiver stroke of hi neat fastmov tail,hemingway
12237,12238,the old man hit him on the head for kind and kick him hi bodi still shudder under the shade of the stern,albacor he said aloud,hemingway
12239,12240,he ll make a beauti bait,he had sung when he wa by himself in the old day and he had sung at night sometim when he wa alon steer on hi watch in the smack or in the turtl boat,hemingway
12241,12242,he had probabl start to talk aloud when alon when the boy had left,but he did not rememb,hemingway
12243,12244,when he and the boy fish togeth they usual spoke onli when it wa necessari,they talk at night or when they were stormbound by bad weather,hemingway
12245,12246,it wa consid a virtu not to talk unnecessarili at sea and the old man had alway consid it so and respect it,but now he said hi thought aloud mani time sinc there wa no one that they could annoy,hemingway
12247,12248,if the other heard me talk out loud they would think that i am crazi he said aloud,but sinc i am not crazi i do not care,hemingway
12249,12250,now is the time to think of onli one thing,that which i wa born for,hemingway
12251,12252,there might be a big one around that school he thought,i pick up onli a straggler from the albacor that were feed,hemingway
12253,12254,but they are work far out and fast,everyth that show on the surfac today travel veri fast and to the northeast,hemingway
12255,12256,can that be the time of day,or is it some sign of weather that i do not know,hemingway
12257,12258,he could not see the green of the shore now but onli the top of the blue hill that show white as though they were snowcap and the cloud that look like high snow mountain abov them,the sea wa veri dark and the light made prism in the water,hemingway
12259,12260,the myriad fleck of the plankton were annul now by the high sun and it wa onli the great deep prism in the blue water that the old man saw now with hi line go straight down into the water that wa a mile deep,the tuna the fishermen call all the fish of that speci tuna and onli distinguish among them by their proper name when they came to sell them or to trade them for bait were down again,hemingway
12261,12262,the sun wa hot now and the old man felt it on the back of hi neck and felt the sweat trickl down hi back as he row,i could just drift he thought and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me,hemingway
12263,12264,but today is eightyf day and i should fish the day well,just then watch hi line he saw one of the project green stick dip sharpli,hemingway
12265,12266,ye he said,ye and ship hi oar without bump the boat,hemingway
12267,12268,he reach out for the line and held it softli between the thumb and forefing of hi right hand,he felt no strain nor weight and he held the line lightli,hemingway
12269,12270,then it came again,thi time it wa a tent pull not solid nor heavi and he knew exactli what it wa,hemingway
12271,12272,one hundr fathom down a marlin wa eat the sardin that cover the point and the shank of the hook where the handforg hook project from the head of the small tuna,the old man held the line delic and softli with hi left hand unleash it from the stick,hemingway
12273,12274,now he could let it run through hi finger without the fish feel ani tension,thi far out he must be huge in thi month he thought,hemingway
12275,12276,eat them fish,eat them,hemingway
12277,12278,pleas eat them,how fresh they are and you down there six hundr feet in that cold water in the dark,hemingway
12279,12280,make anoth turn in the dark and come back and eat them,he felt the light delic pull and then a harder pull when a sardin s head must have been more difficult to break from the hook,hemingway
12281,12282,then there wa noth,come on the old man said aloud,hemingway
12283,12284,make anoth turn,just smell them,hemingway
12285,12286,aren t they love,eat them good now and then there is the tuna,hemingway
12287,12288,hard and cold and love,don t be shi fish,hemingway
12289,12290,then came the same delic pull touch again,he ll take it the old man said aloud,hemingway
12291,12292,he wa gone and the old man felt noth,he can t have gone he said,hemingway
12293,12294,christ know he can t have gone,he s make a turn,hemingway
12295,12296,it wa onli hi turn he said,it wa the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down down down unrol off the first of the two reserv coil,hemingway
12297,12298,as it went down slip lightli through the old man s finger he still could feel the great weight though the pressur of hi thumb and finger were almost impercept,what a fish he said,hemingway
12299,12300,he did not say that becaus he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen,he knew what a huge fish thi wa and he thought of him move away in the dark with the tuna held crosswis in hi mouth,hemingway
12301,12302,at that moment he felt him stop move but the weight wa still there,then the weight increas and he gave more line,hemingway
12303,12304,he tighten the pressur of hi thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increas and wa go straight down,he s taken it he said,hemingway
12305,12306,now he wa readi,he had three fortyfathom coil of line in reserv now as well as the coil he wa use,hemingway
12307,12308,eat it a littl more he said,come up easi and let me put the harpoon into you,hemingway
12309,12310,all right,are you readi,hemingway
12311,12312,have you been long enough at tabl,now he said aloud and struck hard with both hand gain a yard of line and then struck again and again swing with each arm altern on the cord with all the strength of hi arm and the pivot weight of hi bodi,hemingway
12313,12314,noth happen,the fish just move away slowli and the old man could not rais him an inch,hemingway
12315,12316,hi line wa strong and made for heavi fish and he held it against hi back until it wa so taut that bead of water were jump from it,then it began to make a slow hiss sound in the water and he still held it brace himself against the thwart and lean back against the pull,hemingway
12317,12318,the boat began to move slowli off toward the northwest,the fish move steadili and they travel slowli on the calm water,hemingway
12319,12320,the other bait were still in the water but there wa noth to be done,i wish i had the boy the old man said aloud,hemingway
12321,12322,i m be tow by a fish and i m the tow bitt,i could make the line fast,hemingway
12323,12324,but then he could break it,i must hold him all i can and give him line when he must have it,hemingway
12325,12326,what i ll do if he sound and die i don t know,but i ll do someth,hemingway
12327,12328,there are plenti of thing i can do,he held the line against hi back and watch it slant in the water and the skiff move steadili to the northwest,hemingway
12329,12330,thi will kill him the old man thought,he can t do thi forev,hemingway
12331,12332,but four hour later the fish wa still swim steadili out to sea tow the skiff and the old man wa still brace solidli with the line across hi back,it wa noon when i hook him he said,hemingway
12333,12334,he wa thirsti too and he got down on hi knee and be care not to jerk on the line move as far into the bow as he could get and reach the water bottl with one hand,he open it and drank a littl,hemingway
12335,12336,then he rest against the bow,he rest sit on the unstep mast and sail and tri not to think but onli to endur,hemingway
12337,12338,then he look behind him and saw that no land wa visibl,that make no differ he thought,hemingway
12339,12340,i can alway come in on the glow from havana,there are two more hour befor the sun set and mayb he will come up befor that,hemingway
12341,12342,if he doesn t mayb he will come up with the moon,if he doe not do that mayb he will come up with the sunris,hemingway
12343,12344,i have no cramp and i feel strong,it is he that ha the hook in hi mouth,hemingway
12345,12346,but what a fish to pull like that,he must have hi mouth shut tight on the wire,hemingway
12347,12348,i wish i could see him,i wish i could see him onli onc to know what i have against me,hemingway
12349,12350,the fish never chang hi cours nor hi direct all that night as far as the man could tell from watch the star,it wa cold after the sun went down and the old man s sweat dri cold on hi back and hi arm and hi old leg,hemingway
12351,12352,dure the day he had taken the sack that cover the bait box and spread it in the sun to dri,after the sun went down he tie it around hi neck so that it hung down over hi back and he cautious work it down under the line that wa across hi shoulder now,hemingway
12353,12354,the sack cushion the line and he had found a way of lean forward against the bow so that he wa almost comfort,the posit actual wa onli somewhat less intoler but he thought of it as almost comfort,hemingway
12355,12356,i can do noth with him and he can do noth with me he thought,not as long as he keep thi up,hemingway
12357,12358,onc he stood up and urin over the side of the skiff and look at the star and check hi cours,the line show like a phosphoresc streak in the water straight out from hi shoulder,hemingway
12359,12360,they were move more slowli now and the glow of havana wa not so strong so that he knew the current must be carri them to the eastward,if i lose the glare of havana we must be go more to the eastward he thought,hemingway
12361,12362,for if the fish s cours held true i must see it for mani more hour,i wonder how the basebal came out in the grand leagu today he thought,hemingway
12363,12364,it would be wonder to do thi with a radio,then he thought think of it alway,hemingway
12365,12366,think of what you are do,you must do noth stupid,hemingway
12367,12368,then he said aloud i wish i had the boy,but it is unavoid,hemingway
12369,12370,i must rememb to eat the tuna befor he spoil in order to keep strong,rememb no matter how littl you want to that you must eat him in the morn,hemingway
12371,12372,rememb he said to himself,dure the night two porpois came around the boat and he could hear them roll and blow,hemingway
12373,12374,he could tell the differ between the blow nois the male made and the sigh blow of the femal,they are good he said,hemingway
12375,12376,they play and make joke and love one anoth,he is wonder and strang and who know how old he is he thought,hemingway
12377,12378,never have i had such a strong fish nor one who act so strang,perhap he is too wise to jump,hemingway
12379,12380,he could ruin me by jump or by a wild rush,but perhap he ha been hook mani time befor and he know that thi is how he should make hi fight,hemingway
12381,12382,he can not know that it is onli one man against him nor that it is an old man,but what a great fish he is and what he will bring in the market if the flesh is good,hemingway
12383,12384,he took the bait like a male and he pull like a male and hi fight ha no panic in it,i wonder if he ha ani plan or if he is just as desper as i am,hemingway
12385,12386,he rememb the time he had hook one of a pair of marlin,the male fish alway let the femal fish feed first and the hook fish the femal made a wild panicstricken despair fight that soon exhaust her and all the time the male had stay with her cross the line and circl with her on the surfac,hemingway
12387,12388,he had stay so close that the old man wa afraid he would cut the line with hi tail which wa sharp as a scyth and almost of that size and shape,when the old man had gaf her and club her hold the rapier bill with it sandpap edg and club her across the top of her head until her colour turn to a colour almost like the back of mirror and then with the boy s aid hoist her aboard the male fish had stay by the side of the boat,hemingway
12389,12390,then while the old man wa clear the line and prepar the harpoon the male fish jump high into the air besid the boat to see where the femal wa and then went down deep hi lavend wing that were hi pector fin spread wide and all hi wide lavend stripe show,he wa beauti the old man rememb and he had stay,hemingway
12391,12392,that wa the saddest thing i ever saw with them the old man thought,the boy wa sad too and we beg her pardon and butcher her promptli,hemingway
12393,12394,i wish the boy wa here he said aloud and settl himself against the round plank of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across hi shoulder move steadili toward whatev he had chosen,when onc through my treacheri it had been necessari to him to make a choic the old man thought,hemingway
12395,12396,hi choic had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snare and trap and treacheri,my choic wa to go there to find him beyond all peopl,hemingway
12397,12398,beyond all peopl in the world,now we are join togeth and have been sinc noon,hemingway
12399,12400,and no one to help either one of us,perhap i should not have been a fisherman he thought,hemingway
12401,12402,but that wa the thing that i wa born for,i must sure rememb to eat the tuna after it get light,hemingway
12403,12404,some time befor daylight someth took one of the bait that were behind him,he heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwal of the skiff,hemingway
12405,12406,in the dark he loosen hi sheath knife and take all the strain of the fish on hi left shoulder he lean back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwal,then he cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loos end of the reserv coil fast,hemingway
12407,12408,he work skill with the one hand and put hi foot on the coil to hold them as he drew hi knot tight,now he had six reserv coil of line,hemingway
12409,12410,there were two from each bait he had sever and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all connect,after it is light he thought i will work back to the fortyfathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserv coil,hemingway
12411,12412,i will have lost two hundr fathom of good catalan cardel and the hook and leader,that can be replac,hemingway
12413,12414,but who replac thi fish if i hook some fish and it cut him off,i don t know what that fish wa that took the bait just now,hemingway
12415,12416,it could have been a marlin or a broadbil or a shark,i never felt him,hemingway
12417,12418,i had to get rid of him too fast,you have onli yourself and you had better work back to the last line now in the dark or not in the dark and cut it away and hook up the two reserv coil,hemingway
12419,12420,so he did it,it wa difficult in the dark and onc the fish made a surg that pull him down on hi face and made a cut below hi eye,hemingway
12421,12422,the blood ran down hi cheek a littl way,but it coagul and dri befor it reach hi chin and he work hi way back to the bow and rest against the wood,hemingway
12423,12424,he adjust the sack and care work the line so that it came across a new part of hi shoulder and hold it anchor with hi shoulder he care felt the pull of the fish and then felt with hi hand the progress of the skiff through the water,i wonder what he made that lurch for he thought,hemingway
12425,12426,the wire must have slip on the great hill of hi back,certainli hi back can not feel as badli as mine doe,hemingway
12427,12428,but he can not pull thi skiff forev no matter how great he is,now everyth is clear away that might make troubl and i have a big reserv of line all that a man can ask,hemingway
12429,12430,it wa cold now in the time befor daylight and he push against the wood to be warm,i can do it as long as he can he thought,hemingway
12431,12432,and in the first light the line extend out and down into the water,the boat move steadili and when the first edg of the sun rose it wa on the old man s right shoulder,hemingway
12433,12434,he s head north the old man said,the current will have set us far to the eastward he thought,hemingway
12435,12436,i wish he would turn with the current,that would show that he wa tire,hemingway
12437,12438,when the sun had risen further the old man realiz that the fish wa not tire,there wa onli one favor sign,hemingway
12439,12440,the slant of the line show he wa swim at a lesser depth,that did not necessarili mean that he would jump,hemingway
12441,12442,but he might,god let him jump the old man said,hemingway
12443,12444,now that it is daylight let him jump so that he ll fill the sack along hi backbon with air and then he can not go deep to die,he tri to increas the tension but the line had been taut up to the veri edg of the break point sinc he had hook the fish and he felt the harsh as he lean back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it,hemingway
12445,12446,i must not jerk it ever he thought,each jerk widen the cut the hook make and then when he doe jump he might throw it,hemingway
12447,12448,anyway i feel better with the sun and for onc i do not have to look into it,there wa yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that onli made an ad drag and he wa pleas,hemingway
12449,12450,it wa the yellow gulf weed that had made so much phosphoresc in the night,fish he said i love you and respect you veri much,hemingway
12451,12452,a small bird came toward the skiff from the north,he wa a warbler and fli veri low over the water,hemingway
12453,12454,the old man could see that he wa veri tire,the bird made the stern of the boat and rest there,hemingway
12455,12456,then he flew around the old man s head and rest on the line where he wa more comfort,how old are you the old man ask the bird,hemingway
12457,12458,he wa too tire even to examin the line and he teeter on it as hi delic feet grip it fast,it s steadi the old man told him,hemingway
12459,12460,it s too steadi,you shouldn t be that tire after a windless night,hemingway
12461,12462,but he said noth of thi to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawk soon enough,take a good rest small bird he said,hemingway
12463,12464,stay at my hous if you like bird he said,i am sorri i can not hoist the sail and take you in with the small breez that is rise,hemingway
12465,12466,the bird had flown up when the line jerk and the old man had not even seen him go,he felt the line care with hi right hand and notic hi hand wa bleed,hemingway
12467,12468,someth hurt him then he said aloud and pull back on the line to see if he could turn the fish,but when he wa touch the break point he held steadi and settl back against the strain of the line,hemingway
12469,12470,you re feel it now fish he said,the bird wa gone,hemingway
12471,12472,you did not stay long the man thought,but it is rougher where you are go until you make the shore,hemingway
12473,12474,how did i let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made,i must be get veri stupid,hemingway
12475,12476,or perhap i wa look at the small bird and think of him,now i will pay attent to my work and then i must eat the tuna so that i will not have a failur of strength,hemingway
12477,12478,i wish the boy were here and that i had some salt he said aloud,shift the weight of the line to hi left shoulder and kneel care he wash hi hand in the ocean and held it there submerg for more than a minut watch the blood trail away and the steadi movement of the water against hi hand as the boat move,hemingway
12479,12480,he ha slow much he said,the old man would have like to keep hi hand in the salt water longer but he wa afraid of anoth sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and brace himself and held hi hand up against the sun,hemingway
12481,12482,it wa onli a line burn that had cut hi flesh,but it wa in the work part of hi hand,hemingway
12483,12484,he knew he would need hi hand befor thi wa over and he did not like to be cut befor it start,now he said when hi hand had dri i must eat the small tuna,hemingway
12485,12486,hold the line with hi left shoulder again and brace on hi left hand and arm he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place,he put one knee on the fish and cut strip of dark red meat longitudin from the back of the head to the tail,hemingway
12487,12488,they were wedgeshap strip and he cut them from next to the backbon down to the edg of the belli,when he had cut six strip he spread them out on the wood of the bow wipe hi knife on hi trouser and lift the carcass of the bonito by the tail and drop it overboard,hemingway
12489,12490,i don t think i can eat an entir one he said and drew hi knife across one of the strip,he could feel the steadi hard pull of the line and hi left hand wa cramp,hemingway
12491,12492,it drew up tight on the heavi cord and he look at it in disgust,what kind of a hand is that he said,hemingway
12493,12494,cramp then if you want,make yourself into a claw,hemingway
12495,12496,eat it now and it will strengthen the hand,it is not the hand s fault and you have been mani hour with the fish,hemingway
12497,12498,but you can stay with him forev,eat the bonito now,hemingway
12499,12500,he pick up a piec and put it in hi mouth and chew it slowli,it wa not unpleas,hemingway
12501,12502,chew it well he thought and get all the juic,it would not be bad to eat with a littl lime or with lemon or with salt,hemingway
12503,12504,how do you feel hand he ask the cramp hand that wa almost as stiff as rigor morti,he chew it care and then spat out the skin,hemingway
12505,12506,how doe it go hand,it is a strong fullblood fish he thought,hemingway
12507,12508,i wa lucki to get him instead of dolphin,dolphin is too sweet,hemingway
12509,12510,i wish i had some salt,and i do not know whether the sun will rot or dri what is left so i had better eat it all although i am not hungri,hemingway
12511,12512,the fish is calm and steadi,i will eat it all and then i will be readi,hemingway
12513,12514,be patient hand he said,he is my brother,hemingway
12515,12516,but i must kill him and keep strong to do it,slowli and conscienti he ate all of the wedgeshap strip of fish,hemingway
12517,12518,he straighten up wipe hi hand on hi trouser,now he said,hemingway
12519,12520,you can let the cord go hand and i will handl him with the right arm alon until you stop that nonsense he put hi left foot on the heavi line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against hi back,god help me to have the cramp go he said,hemingway
12521,12522,but what is hi plan he thought,and what is mine,hemingway
12523,12524,mine i must improvis to hi becaus of hi great size,if he will jump i can kill him,hemingway
12525,12526,but he stay down forev,then i will stay down with him forev,hemingway
12527,12528,he rub the cramp hand against hi trouser and tri to gentl the finger,but it would not open,hemingway
12529,12530,mayb it will open with the sun he thought,mayb it will open when the strong raw tuna is digest,hemingway
12531,12532,if i have to have it i will open it cost whatev it cost,but i do not want to open it now by forc,hemingway
12533,12534,let it open by itself and come back of it own accord,after all i abus it much in the night when it wa necessari to free and unti the variou line,hemingway
12535,12536,he look across the sea and knew how alon he wa now,but he could see the prism in the deep dark water and the line stretch ahead and the strang undul of the calm,hemingway
12537,12538,the cloud were build up now for the trade wind and he look ahead and saw a flight of wild duck etch themselv against the sky over the water then blur then etch again and he knew no man wa ever alon on the sea,he thought of how some men fear be out of sight of land in a small boat and knew they were right in the month of sudden bad weather,hemingway
12539,12540,but now they were in hurrican month and when there are no hurrican the weather of hurrican month is the best of all the year,if there is a hurrican you alway see the sign of it in the sky for day ahead if you are at sea,hemingway
12541,12542,they do not see it ashor becaus they do not know what to look for he thought,the land must make a differ too in the shape of the cloud,hemingway
12543,12544,but we have no hurrican come now,he look at the sky and saw the white cumulu built like friendli pile of ice cream and high abov were the thin feather of the cirru against the high septemb sky,hemingway
12545,12546,light brisa he said,i hate a cramp he thought,hemingway
12547,12548,it is a treacheri of one s own bodi,it is humili befor other to have a diarrhoea from ptomain poison or to vomit from it,hemingway
12549,12550,but a cramp he thought of it as a calambr humili oneself especi when one is alon,if the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm he thought,hemingway
12551,12552,but it will loosen up,then with hi right hand he felt the differ in the pull of the line befor he saw the slant chang in the water,hemingway
12553,12554,then as he lean against the line and slap hi left hand hard and fast against hi thigh he saw the line slant slowli upward,he s come up he said,hemingway
12555,12556,come on hand,he came out unendingli and water pour from hi side,hemingway
12557,12558,he wa bright in the sun and hi head and back were dark purpl and in the sun the stripe on hi side show wide and a light lavend,hi sword wa as long as a basebal bat and taper like a rapier and he rose hi full length from the water and then reent it smoothli like a diver and the old man saw the great scytheblad of hi tail go under and the line commenc to race out,hemingway
12559,12560,he is two feet longer than the skiff the old man said,the line wa go out fast but steadili and the fish wa not panick,hemingway
12561,12562,the old man wa tri with both hand to keep the line just insid of break strength,he knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steadi pressur the fish could take out all the line and break it,hemingway
12563,12564,he is a great fish and i must convinc him he thought,i must never let him learn hi strength nor what he could do if he made hi run,hemingway
12565,12566,if i were him i would put in everyth now and go until someth broke,but thank god they are not as intellig as we who kill them although they are more nobl and more abl,hemingway
12567,12568,the old man had seen mani great fish,he had seen mani that weigh more than a thousand pound and he had caught two of that size in hi life but never alon,hemingway
12569,12570,now alon and out of sight of land he wa fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of and hi left hand wa still as tight as the grip claw of an eagl,it will uncramp though he thought,hemingway
12571,12572,sure it will uncramp to help my right hand,there are three thing that are brother the fish and my two hand,hemingway
12573,12574,it must uncramp,it is unworthi of it to be cramp,hemingway
12575,12576,the fish had slow again and wa go at hi usual pace,i wonder whi he jump the old man thought,hemingway
12577,12578,he jump almost as though to show me how big he wa,i know now anyway he thought,hemingway
12579,12580,i wish i could show him what sort of man i am,but then he would see the cramp hand,hemingway
12581,12582,let him think i am more man than i am and i will be so,i wish i wa the fish he thought with everyth he ha against onli my will and my intellig,hemingway
12583,12584,he settl comfort against the wood and took hi suffer as it came and the fish swam steadili and the boat move slowli through the dark water,there wa a small sea rise with the wind come up from the east and at noon the old man s left hand wa uncramp,hemingway
12585,12586,bad news for you fish he said and shift the line over the sack that cover hi shoulder,he wa comfort but suffer although he did not admit the suffer at all,hemingway
12587,12588,i am not religi he said,but i will say ten our father and ten hail mari that i should catch thi fish and i promis to make a pilgrimag to the virgin of cobr if i catch him,hemingway
12589,12590,sometim he would be so tire that he could not rememb the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automat,hail mari are easier to say than our father he thought,hemingway
12591,12592,hail mari full of grace the lord is with thee,bless art thou among women and bless is the fruit of thi womb jesu,hemingway
12593,12594,holi mari mother of god pray for us sinner now and at the hour of our death,amen then he ad bless virgin pray for the death of thi fish,hemingway
12595,12596,the sun wa hot now although the breez wa rise gentli,i had better rebait that littl line out over the stern he said,hemingway
12597,12598,if the fish decid to stay anoth night i will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottl,i don t think i can get anyth but a dolphin here,hemingway
12599,12600,but if i eat him fresh enough he won t be bad,i wish a fli fish would come on board tonight,hemingway
12601,12602,but i have no light to attract them,a fli fish is excel to eat raw and i would not have to cut him up,hemingway
12603,12604,i must save all my strength now,but i will show him what a man can do and what a man endur,hemingway
12605,12606,i told the boy i wa a strang old man he said,now he wa prove it again,hemingway
12607,12608,each time wa a new time and he never thought about the past when he wa do it,i wish he d sleep and i could sleep and dream about the lion he thought,hemingway
12609,12610,whi are the lion the main thing that is left,don t think old man he said to himself,hemingway
12611,12612,rest gentli now against the wood and think of noth,he is work,hemingway
12613,12614,work as littl as you can,it wa get into the afternoon and the boat still move slowli and steadili,hemingway
12615,12616,but there wa an ad drag now from the easterli breez and the old man rode gentli with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across hi back came to him easili and smoothli,onc in the afternoon the line start to rise again,hemingway
12617,12618,but the fish onli continu to swim at a slightli higher level,the sun wa on the old man s left arm and shoulder and on hi back,hemingway
12619,12620,so he knew the fish had turn east of north,now that he had seen him onc he could pictur the fish swim in the water with hi purpl pector fin set wide as wing and the great erect tail slice through the dark,hemingway
12621,12622,i wonder how much he see at that depth the old man thought,hi eye is huge and a hors with much less eye can see in the dark,hemingway
12623,12624,onc i could see quit well in the dark,not in the absolut dark,hemingway
12625,12626,but almost as a cat see,the sun and hi steadi movement of hi finger had uncramp hi left hand now complet and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrug the muscl of hi back to shift the hurt of the cord a littl,hemingway
12627,12628,he thought of the big leagu to him they were the gran liga and he knew that the yanke of new york were play the tigr of detroit,thi is the second day now that i do not know the result of the juego he thought,hemingway
12629,12630,but i must have confid and i must be worthi of the great dimaggio who doe all thing perfectli even with the pain of the bone spur in hi heel,what is a bone spur,hemingway
12631,12632,he ask himself,un espuela de hueso,hemingway
12633,12634,we do not have them,can it be as pain as the spur of a fight cock in one s heel,hemingway
12635,12636,i do not think i could endur that or the loss of the eye and of both eye and continu to fight as the fight cock do,man is not much besid the great bird and beast,hemingway
12637,12638,still i would rather be that beast down there in the dark of the sea,unless shark come he said aloud,hemingway
12639,12640,he thought,i am sure he would and more sinc he is young and strong,hemingway
12641,12642,also hi father wa a fisherman,but would the bone spur hurt him too much,hemingway
12643,12644,i do not know he said aloud,they had gone one day and one night with their elbow on a chalk line on the tabl and their forearm straight up and their hand grip tight,hemingway
12645,12646,each one wa tri to forc the other s hand down onto the tabl,there wa much bet and peopl went in and out of the room under the kerosen light and he had look at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro s face,hemingway
12647,12648,they chang the refere everi four hour after the first eight so that the refere could sleep,blood came out from under the fingernail of both hi and the negro s hand and they look each other in the eye and at their hand and forearm and the bettor went in and out of the room and sat on high chair against the wall and watch,hemingway
12649,12650,the wall were paint bright blue and were of wood and the lamp threw their shadow against them,the negro s shadow wa huge and it move on the wall as the breez move the lamp,hemingway
12651,12652,the odd would chang back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and light cigarett for him,then the negro after the rum would tri for a tremend effort and onc he had the old man who wa not an old man then but wa santiago el campeón nearli three inch off balanc,hemingway
12653,12654,but the old man had rais hi hand up to dead even again,he wa sure then that he had the negro who wa a fine man and a great athlet beaten,hemingway
12655,12656,and at daylight when the bettor were ask that it be call a draw and the refere wa shake hi head he had unleash hi effort and forc the hand of the negro down and down until it rest on the wood,the match had start on a sunday morn and end on a monday morn,hemingway
12657,12658,mani of the bettor had ask for a draw becaus they had to go to work on the dock load sack of sugar or at the havana coal compani,otherwis everyon would have want it to go to a finish,hemingway
12659,12660,but he had finish it anyway and befor anyon had to go to work,for a long time after that everyon had call him the champion and there had been a return match in the spring,hemingway
12661,12662,but not much money wa bet and he had won it quit easili sinc he had broken the confid of the negro from cienfuego in the first match,after that he had a few match and then no more,hemingway
12663,12664,he decid that he could beat anyon if he want to badli enough and he decid that it wa bad for hi right hand for fish,he had tri a few practic match with hi left hand,hemingway
12665,12666,but hi left hand had alway been a traitor and would not do what he call on it to do and he did not trust it,the sun will bake it out well now he thought,hemingway
12667,12668,it should not cramp on me again unless it get too cold in the night,i wonder what thi night will bring,hemingway
12669,12670,an airplan pass overhead on it cours to miami and he watch it shadow scare up the school of fli fish,with so much fli fish there should be dolphin he said and lean back on the line to see if it wa possibl to gain ani on hi fish,hemingway
12671,12672,but he could not and it stay at the hard and waterdrop shiver that preced break,the boat move ahead slowli and he watch the airplan until he could no longer see it,hemingway
12673,12674,it must be veri strang in an airplan he thought,i wonder what the sea look like from that height,hemingway
12675,12676,they should be abl to see the fish well if they do not fli too high,i would like to fli veri slowli at two hundr fathom high and see the fish from abov,hemingway
12677,12678,in the turtl boat i wa in the crosstre of the masthead and even at that height i saw much,the dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripe and their purpl spot and you can see all of the school as they swim,hemingway
12679,12680,whi is it that all the fastmov fish of the dark current have purpl back and usual purpl stripe or spot,the dolphin look green of cours becaus he is realli golden,hemingway
12681,12682,but when he come to feed truli hungri purpl stripe show on hi side as on a marlin,can it be anger or the greater speed he make that bring them out,hemingway
12683,12684,just befor it wa dark as they pass a great island of sargasso weed that heav and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were make love with someth under a yellow blanket hi small line wa taken by a dolphin,he saw it first when it jump in the air true gold in the last of the sun and bend and flap wildli in the air,hemingway
12685,12686,it jump again and again in the acrobat of it fear and he work hi way back to the stern and crouch and hold the big line with hi right hand and arm he pull the dolphin in with hi left hand step on the gain line each time with hi bare left foot,when the fish wa at the stern plung and cut from side to side in desper the old man lean over the stern and lift the burnish gold fish with it purpl spot over the stern,hemingway
12687,12688,it jaw were work convuls in quick bite against the hook and it pound the bottom of the skiff with it long flat bodi it tail and it head until he club it across the shine golden head until it shiver and wa still,the old man unhook the fish rebait the line with anoth sardin and toss it over,hemingway
12689,12690,then he work hi way slowli back to the bow,he wash hi left hand and wipe it on hi trouser,hemingway
12691,12692,then he shift the heavi line from hi right hand to hi left and wash hi right hand in the sea while he watch the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord,he hasn t chang at all he said,hemingway
12693,12694,but watch the movement of the water against hi hand he note that it wa percept slower,i ll lash the two oar togeth across the stern and that will slow him in the night he said,hemingway
12695,12696,i can do that a littl later and lash the oar to make a drag at the same time,i had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset,hemingway
12697,12698,the set of the sun is a difficult time for all fish,he let hi hand dri in the air then grasp the line with it and eas himself as much as he could and allow himself to be pull forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much or more than he did,hemingway
12699,12700,i m learn how to do it he thought,thi part of it anyway,hemingway
12701,12702,then too rememb he hasn t eaten sinc he took the bait and he is huge and need much food,i have eaten the whole bonito,hemingway
12703,12704,tomorrow i will eat the dolphin,he call it dorado,hemingway
12705,12706,perhap i should eat some of it when i clean it,it will be harder to eat than the bonito,hemingway
12707,12708,but then noth is easi,how do you feel fish he ask aloud,hemingway
12709,12710,i feel good and my left hand is better and i have food for a night and a day,but i have had wors thing than that he thought,hemingway
12711,12712,my hand is onli cut a littl and the cramp is gone from the other,my leg are all right,hemingway
12713,12714,also now i have gain on him in the question of susten,it wa dark now as it becom dark quickli after the sun set in septemb,hemingway
12715,12716,he lay against the worn wood of the bow and rest all that he could,the first star were out,hemingway
12717,12718,he did not know the name of rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all hi distant friend,the fish is my friend too he said aloud,hemingway
12719,12720,i have never seen or heard of such a fish,but i must kill him,hemingway
12721,12722,the moon run away,but imagin if a man each day should have to tri to kill the sun,hemingway
12723,12724,we were born lucki he thought,then he wa sorri for the great fish that had noth to eat and hi determin to kill him never relax in hi sorrow for him,hemingway
12725,12726,how mani peopl will he feed he thought,but are they worthi to eat him,hemingway
12727,12728,no of cours not,there is no one worthi of eat him from the manner of hi behaviour and hi great digniti,hemingway
12729,12730,i do not understand these thing he thought,but it is good that we do not have to tri to kill the sun or the moon or the star,hemingway
12731,12732,it is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brother,now he thought i must think about the drag,hemingway
12733,12734,it ha it peril and it merit,i may lose so much line that i will lose him if he make hi effort and the drag made by the oar is in place and the boat lose all her light,hemingway
12735,12736,her light prolong both our suffer but it is my safeti sinc he ha great speed that he ha never yet employ,no matter what pass i must gut the dolphin so he doe not spoil and eat some of him to be strong,hemingway
12737,12738,now i will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steadi befor i move back to the stern to do the work and make the decis,in the meantim i can see how he act and if he show ani chang,hemingway
12739,12740,the oar are a good trick but it ha reach the time to play for safeti,he is much fish still and i saw that the hook wa in the corner of hi mouth and he ha kept hi mouth tight shut,hemingway
12741,12742,the punish of the hook is noth,the punish of hunger and that he is against someth that he doe not comprehend is everyth,hemingway
12743,12744,rest now old man and let him work until your next duti come,he rest for what he believ to be two hour,hemingway
12745,12746,the moon did not rise now until late and he had no way of judg the time,nor wa he realli rest except compar,hemingway
12747,12748,he wa still bear the pull of the fish across hi shoulder but he place hi left hand on the gunwal of the bow and confid more and more of the resist to the fish to the skiff itself,how simpl it would be if i could make the line fast he thought,hemingway
12749,12750,but with one small lurch he could break it,i must cushion the pull of the line with my bodi and at all time be readi to give line with both hand,hemingway
12751,12752,but you have not slept yet old man he said aloud,it is half a day and a night and now anoth day and you have not slept,hemingway
12753,12754,you must devis a way so that you sleep a littl if he is quiet and steadi,too clear,hemingway
12755,12756,i am as clear as the star that are my brother,still i must sleep,hemingway
12757,12758,they sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleep sometim on certain day when there is no current and a flat calm,but rememb to sleep he thought,hemingway
12759,12760,make yourself do it and devis some simpl and sure way about the line,now go back and prepar the dolphin,hemingway
12761,12762,it is too danger to rig the oar as a drag if you must sleep,i could go without sleep he told himself,hemingway
12763,12764,but it would be too danger,he start to work hi way back to the stern on hi hand and knee be care not to jerk against the fish,hemingway
12765,12766,he may be half asleep himself he thought,but i do not want him to rest,hemingway
12767,12768,he must pull until he die,back in the stern he turn so that hi left hand held the strain of the line across hi shoulder and drew hi knife from it sheath with hi right hand,hemingway
12769,12770,the star were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearli and he push the blade of hi knife into hi head and drew him out from under the stern,he put one of hi feet on the fish and slit him quickli from the vent up to the tip of hi lower jaw,hemingway
12771,12772,then he put hi knife down and gut him with hi right hand scoop him clean and pull the gill clear,he felt the maw heavi and slipperi in hi hand and he slit it open,hemingway
12773,12774,there were two fli fish insid,they were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and drop the gut and the gill over the stern,hemingway
12775,12776,they sank leav a trail of phosphoresc in the water,the dolphin wa cold and a leprou graywhit now in the starlight and the old man skin one side of him while he held hi right foot on the fish s head,hemingway
12777,12778,then he turn him over and skin the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail,he slid the carcass overboard and look to see if there wa ani swirl in the water,hemingway
12779,12780,but there wa onli the light of it slow descent,he turn then and place the two fli fish insid the two fillet of fish and put hi knife back in it sheath he work hi way slowli back to the bow,hemingway
12781,12782,hi back wa bent with the weight of the line across it and he carri the fish in hi right hand,back in the bow he laid the two fillet of fish out on the wood with the fli fish besid them,hemingway
12783,12784,after that he settl the line across hi shoulder in a new place and held it again with hi left hand rest on the gunwal,then he lean over the side and wash the fli fish in the water note the speed of the water against hi hand,hemingway
12785,12786,hi hand wa phosphoresc from skin the fish and he watch the flow of the water against it,the flow wa less strong and as he rub the side of hi hand against the plank of the skiff particl of phosphoru float off and drift slowli astern,hemingway
12787,12788,he is tire or he is rest the old man said,what an excel fish dolphin is to eat cook he said,hemingway
12789,12790,and what a miser fish raw,but then i did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset,hemingway
12791,12792,still it wa a lack of prepar,but i have chew it all well and i am not nauseat,hemingway
12793,12794,the sky wa cloud over to the east and one after anoth the star he knew were gone,it look now as though he were move into a great canyon of cloud and the wind had drop,hemingway
12795,12796,there will be bad weather in three or four day he said,but not tonight and not tomorrow,hemingway
12797,12798,then he pass the line a littl lower on hi shoulder and brace hi left hand on it,my right hand can hold it as long as it is brace he thought,hemingway
12799,12800,if it relax in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goe out,it is hard on the right hand,hemingway
12801,12802,but he is use to punish,even if i sleep twenti minut or a half an hour it is good,hemingway
12803,12804,he lay forward cramp himself against the line with all of hi bodi put all hi weight onto hi right hand and he wa asleep,he did not dream of the lion but instead of a vast school of porpois that stretch for eight or ten mile and it wa in the time of their mate and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leap,hemingway
12805,12806,then he dream that he wa in the villag on hi bed and there wa a norther and he wa veri cold and hi right arm wa asleep becaus hi head had rest on it instead of a pillow,after that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lion come down onto it in the earli dark and then the other lion came and he rest hi chin on the wood of the bow where the ship lay anchor with the even offshor breez and he wait to see if there would be more lion and he wa happi,hemingway
12807,12808,the moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish pull on steadili and the boat move into the tunnel of cloud,he woke with the jerk of hi right fist come up against hi face and the line burn out through hi right hand,hemingway
12809,12810,he had no feel of hi left hand but he brake all he could with hi right and the line rush out,final hi left hand found the line and he lean back against the line and now it burn hi back and hi left hand and hi left hand wa take all the strain and cut badli,hemingway
12811,12812,he look back at the coil of line and they were feed smoothli,just then the fish jump make a great burst of the ocean and then a heavi fall,hemingway
12813,12814,then he jump again and again and the boat wa go fast although line wa still race out and the old man wa rais the strain to break point and rais it to break point again and again,he had been pull down tight onto the bow and hi face wa in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move,hemingway
12815,12816,thi is what we wait for he thought,so now let us take it,hemingway
12817,12818,make him pay for the line he thought,make him pay for it,hemingway
12819,12820,he could not see the fish s jump but onli heard the break of the ocean and the heavi splash as he fell,the speed of the line wa cut hi hand badli but he had alway known thi would happen and he tri to keep the cut across the callous part and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the finger,hemingway
12821,12822,if the boy wa here he would wet the coil of line he thought,ye,hemingway
12823,12824,if the boy were here,if the boy were here,hemingway
12825,12826,the line went out and out and out but it wa slow now and he wa make the fish earn each inch of it,now he got hi head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that hi cheek had crush,hemingway
12827,12828,then he wa on hi knee and then he rose slowli to hi feet,he wa cede line but more slowli all he time,hemingway
12829,12830,he work back to where he could feel with hi foot the coil of line that he could not see,there wa plenti of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water,hemingway
12831,12832,ye he thought,and now he ha jump more than a dozen time and fill the sack along hi back with air and he can not go down deep to die where i can not bring him up,hemingway
12833,12834,he will start circl soon and then i must work on him,i wonder what start him so suddenli,hemingway
12835,12836,could it have been hunger that made him desper or wa he frighten by someth in the night,mayb he suddenli felt fear,hemingway
12837,12838,but he wa such a calm strong fish and he seem so fearless and so confid,it is strang,hemingway
12839,12840,you better be fearless and confid yourself old man he said,you re hold him again but you can not get line,hemingway
12841,12842,he wa afraid that it might nauseat him and he would vomit and lose hi strength,when hi face wa clean he wash hi right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watch the first light come befor the sunris,hemingway
12843,12844,he s head almost east he thought,that mean he is tire and go with the current,hemingway
12845,12846,soon he will have to circl,then our true work begin,hemingway
12847,12848,after he judg that hi right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and look at it,it is not bad he said,hemingway
12849,12850,you did not do so badli for someth worthless he said to hi left hand,he thought,hemingway
12851,12852,perhap it wa my fault in not train that one properli,but god know he ha had enough chanc to learn,hemingway
12853,12854,he did not do so badli in the night though and he ha onli cramp onc,if he cramp again let the line cut him off,hemingway
12855,12856,when he thought that he knew that he wa not be clearhead and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin,but i can t he told himself,hemingway
12857,12858,it is better to be lighthead than to lose your strength from nausea,and i know i can not keep it if i eat it sinc my face wa in it,hemingway
12859,12860,i will keep it for an emerg until it goe bad,but it is too late to tri for strength now through nourish,hemingway
12861,12862,you re stupid he told himself,eat the other fli fish,hemingway
12863,12864,it wa there clean and readi and he pick it up with hi left hand and ate it chew the bone care and eat all of it down to the tail,it ha more nourish than almost ani fish he thought,hemingway
12865,12866,at least the kind of strength that i need,now i have done what i can he thought,hemingway
12867,12868,let him begin to circl and let the fight come,the sun wa rise for the third time sinc he had put to sea when the fish start to circl,hemingway
12869,12870,he could not see by the slant of the line that the fish wa circl,it wa too earli for that,hemingway
12871,12872,he just felt a faint slacken of the pressur of the line and he commenc to pull on it gentli with hi right hand,it tighten as alway but just when he reach the point where it would break line began to come in,hemingway
12873,12874,he slip hi shoulder and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadili and gentli,he use both of hi hand in a swing motion and tri to do the pull as much as he could with hi bodi and hi leg,hemingway
12875,12876,hi old leg and shoulder pivot with the swing of the pull,it is a veri big circl he said,hemingway
12877,12878,then it start out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingli back into the dark water,he is make the far part of hi circl now he said,hemingway
12879,12880,i must hold all i can he thought,the strain will shorten hi circl each time,hemingway
12881,12882,perhap in an hour i will see him,now i must convinc him and then i must kill him,hemingway
12883,12884,but the fish kept on circl slowli and the old man wa wet with sweat and tire deep into hi bone two hour later,but the circl were much shorter now and from the way the line slant he could tell the fish had risen steadili while he swam,hemingway
12885,12886,for an hour the old man had been see black spot befor hi eye and the sweat salt hi eye and salt the cut over hi eye and on hi forehead,he wa not afraid of the black spot,hemingway
12887,12888,they were normal at the tension that he wa pull on the line,twice though he had felt faint and dizzi and that had worri him,hemingway
12889,12890,i could not fail myself and die on a fish like thi he said,now that i have him come so beauti god help me endur,hemingway
12891,12892,i ll say a hundr our father and a hundr hail mari,i ll say them later,hemingway
12893,12894,just then he felt a sudden bang and jerk on the line he held with hi two hand,it wa sharp and hardfeel and heavi,hemingway
12895,12896,he is hit the wire leader with hi spear he thought,that wa bound to come,hemingway
12897,12898,he had to do that,it may make him jump though and i would rather he stay circl now,hemingway
12899,12900,the jump were necessari for him to take air,but after that each one can widen the open of the hook wound and he can throw the hook,hemingway
12901,12902,don t jump fish he said,i must hold hi pain where it is he thought,hemingway
12903,12904,mine doe not matter,i can control mine,hemingway
12905,12906,but hi pain could drive him mad,after a while the fish stop beat at the wire and start circl slowli again,hemingway
12907,12908,the old man wa gain line steadili now,but he felt faint again,hemingway
12909,12910,he lift some sea water with hi left hand and put it on hi head,then he put more on and rub the back of hi neck,hemingway
12911,12912,i have no cramp he said,he ll be up soon and i can last,hemingway
12913,12914,you have to last,i ll rest now while he goe out on the circl and then stand up and work on him when he come in he decid,hemingway
12915,12916,it wa a great temptat to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circl by himself without recov ani line,but when the strain show the fish had turn to come toward the boat the old man rose to hi feet and start the pivot and the weav pull that brought in all the line he gain,hemingway
12917,12918,i m tired than i have ever been he thought and now the trade wind is rise,but that will be good to take him in with,hemingway
12919,12920,i need that badli,i ll rest on the next turn as he goe out he said,hemingway
12921,12922,i feel much better,you work now fish he thought,hemingway
12923,12924,i ll take you at the turn,the sea had risen consider,hemingway
12925,12926,but it wa a fairweath breez and he had to have it to get home,i ll just steer south and west he said,hemingway
12927,12928,he saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believ it length,no he said,hemingway
12929,12930,it wa higher than a big scyth blade and a veri pale lavend abov the dark blue water,it rake back and as the fish swam just below the surfac the old man could see hi huge bulk and the purpl stripe that band him,hemingway
12931,12932,hi dorsal fin wa down and hi huge pector were spread wide,on thi circl the old man could see the fish s eye and the two gray suck fish that swam around him,hemingway
12933,12934,sometim they attach themselv to him,sometim they dart off,hemingway
12935,12936,sometim they would swim easili in hi shadow,they were each over three feet long and when they swam fast they lash their whole bodi like eel,hemingway
12937,12938,the old man wa sweat now but from someth els besid the sun,on each calm placid turn the fish made he wa gain line and he wa sure that in two turn more he would have a chanc to get the harpoon in,hemingway
12939,12940,but i must get him close close close he thought,i mustn t tri for the head,hemingway
12941,12942,i must get the heart,be calm and strong old man he said,hemingway
12943,12944,on the next circl the fish s back wa out but he wa a littl too far from the boat,on the next circl he wa still too far away but he wa higher out of water and the old man wa sure that by gain some more line he could have him alongsid,hemingway
12945,12946,he had rig hi harpoon long befor and it coil of light rope wa in a round basket and the end wa made fast to the bitt in the bow,the fish wa come in on hi circl now calm and beauti look and onli hi great tail move,hemingway
12947,12948,the old man pull on him all that he could to bring him closer,for just a moment the fish turn a littl on hi side,hemingway
12949,12950,then he straighten himself and began anoth circl,i move him the old man said,hemingway
12951,12952,i move him he thought,mayb thi time i can get him over,hemingway
12953,12954,pull hand he thought,hold up leg,hemingway
12955,12956,last for me head,last for me,hemingway
12957,12958,you never went,thi time i ll pull him over,hemingway
12959,12960,but when he put all of hi effort on start it well out befor the fish came alongsid and pull with all hi strength the fish pull part way over and then right himself and swam away,fish the old man said,hemingway
12961,12962,fish you are go to have to die anyway,hi mouth wa too dri to speak but he could not reach for the water now,hemingway
12963,12964,i must get him alongsid thi time he thought,i am not good for mani more turn,hemingway
12965,12966,ye you are he told himself,you re good for ever,hemingway
12967,12968,on the next turn he nearli had him,but again the fish right himself and swam slowli away,hemingway
12969,12970,you are kill me fish the old man thought,but you have a right to,hemingway
12971,12972,never have i seen a greater or more beauti or a calmer or more nobl thing than you brother,come on and kill me,hemingway
12973,12974,i do not care who kill who,now you are get confus in the head he thought,hemingway
12975,12976,you must keep your head clear,keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man,hemingway
12977,12978,or a fish he thought,clear up head he said in a voic he could hardli hear,hemingway
12979,12980,i do not know the old man thought,he had been on the point of feel himself go each time,hemingway
12981,12982,i do not know,but i will tri it onc more,hemingway
12983,12984,he tri it onc more and he felt himself go when he turn the fish,the fish right himself and swam off again slowli with the great tail weav in the air,hemingway
12985,12986,i ll tri it again the old man promis although hi hand were mushi now and he could onli see well in flash,he tri it again and it wa the same,hemingway
12987,12988,so he thought and he felt himself go befor he start i will tri it onc again,he took all hi pain and what wa left of hi strength and hi long gone pride and he put it against the fish s agoni and the fish came over onto hi side and swam gentli on hi side hi bill almost touch the plank of the skiff and start to pass the boat long deep wide silver and bar with purpl and intermin in the water,hemingway
12989,12990,the old man drop the line and put hi foot on it and lift the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all hi strength and more strength he had just summon into the fish s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitud of the man s chest,he felt the iron go in and he lean on it and drove it further and then push all hi weight after it,hemingway
12991,12992,then the fish came aliv with hi death in him and rose high out of the water show all hi great length and width and all hi power and hi beauti,he seem to hang in the air abov the old man in the skiff,hemingway
12993,12994,then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff,the old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well,hemingway
12995,12996,but he clear the harpoon line and let it run slowli through hi raw hand and when he could see he saw the fish wa on hi back with hi silver belli up,the shaft of the harpoon wa project at an angl from the fish s shoulder and the sea wa discolour with the red of the blood from hi heart,hemingway
12997,12998,first it wa dark as a shoal in the blue water that wa more than a mile deep,then it spread like a cloud,hemingway
12999,13000,the fish wa silveri and still and float with the wave,the old man look care in the glimps of vision that he had,hemingway
13001,13002,then he took two turn of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid hi head on hi hand,keep my head clear he said against the wood of the bow,hemingway
13003,13004,i am a tire old man,even if we were two and swamp her to load him and bail her out thi skiff would never hold him,hemingway
13005,13006,i must prepar everyth then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home,he start to pull the fish in to have him alongsid so that he could pass a line through hi gill and out hi mouth and make hi head fast alongsid the bow,hemingway
13007,13008,i want to see him he thought and to touch and to feel him,he is my fortun he thought,hemingway
13009,13010,but that is not whi i wish to feel him,i think i felt hi heart he thought,hemingway
13011,13012,when i push on the harpoon shaft the second time,bring him in now and make him fast and get the noos around hi tail and anoth around hi middl to bind him to the skiff,hemingway
13013,13014,get to work old man he said,he took a veri small drink of the water,hemingway
13015,13016,he look at the sun care,it is not much more than noon he thought,hemingway
13017,13018,and the trade wind is rise,the line all mean noth now,hemingway
13019,13020,the boy and i will splice them when we are home,come on fish he said,hemingway
13021,13022,but the fish did not come,instead he lay there wallow now in the sea and the old man pull the skiff up onto him,hemingway
13023,13024,when he wa even with him and had the fish s head against the bow he could not believ hi size,but he unti the harpoon rope from the bitt pass it through the fish s gill and out hi jaw made a turn around hi sword then pass the rope through the other gill made anoth turn around the bill and knot the doubl rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow,hemingway
13025,13026,he cut the rope then and went astern to noos the tail,the fish had turn silver from hi origin purpl and silver and the stripe show the same pale violet colour as hi tail,hemingway
13027,13028,they were wider than a man s hand with hi finger spread and the fish s eye look as detach as the mirror in a periscop or as a saint in a process,it wa the onli way to kill him the old man said,hemingway
13029,13030,he wa feel better sinc the water and he knew he would not go away and hi head wa clear,he s over fifteen hundr pound the way he is he thought,hemingway
13031,13032,mayb much more,if he dress out twothird of that at thirti cent a pound,hemingway
13033,13034,i need a pencil for that he said,my head is not that clear,hemingway
13035,13036,but i think the great dimaggio would be proud of me today,i had no bone spur,hemingway
13037,13038,but the hand and the back hurt truly i wonder what a bone spur is he thought,mayb we have them without know of it,hemingway
13039,13040,he made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middl thwart,he wa so big it wa like lash a much bigger skiff alongsid,hemingway
13041,13042,he cut a piec of line and tie the fish s lower jaw against hi bill so hi mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanli as possibl,then he step the mast and with the stick that wa hi gaff and with hi boom rig the patch sail drew the boat began to move and half lie in the stern he sail southwest,hemingway
13043,13044,he did not need a compass to tell him where southwest wa,he onli need the feel of the trade wind and the draw of the sail,hemingway
13045,13046,i better put a small line out with a spoon on it and tri and get someth to eat and drink for the moistur,but he could not find a spoon and hi sardin were rotten,hemingway
13047,13048,so he hook a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they pass and shook it so that the small shrimp that were in it fell onto the plank of the skiff,there were more than a dozen of them and they jump and kick like sand flea,hemingway
13049,13050,the old man pinch their head off with hi thumb and forefing and ate them chew up the shell and the tail,they were veri tini but he knew they were nourish and they tast good,hemingway
13051,13052,the old man still had two drink of water in the bottl and he use half of one after he had eaten the shrimp,the skiff wa sail well consid the handicap and he steer with the tiller under hi arm,hemingway
13053,13054,he could see the fish and he had onli to look at hi hand and feel hi back against the stern to know that thi had truli happen and wa not a dream,at one time when he wa feel so badli toward the end he had thought perhap it wa a dream,hemingway
13055,13056,then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky befor he fell he wa sure there wa some great strang and he could not believ it,then he could not see well although now he saw as well as ever,hemingway
13057,13058,now he knew there wa the fish and hi hand and back were no dream,the hand cure quickli he thought,hemingway
13059,13060,i bled them clean and the salt water will heal them,the dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that there is,hemingway
13061,13062,all i must do is keep the head clear,the hand have done their work and we sail well,hemingway
13063,13064,with hi mouth shut and hi tail straight up and down we sail like brother,then hi head start to becom a littl unclear and he thought is he bring me in or am i bring him in,hemingway
13065,13066,if i were tow him behind there would be no question,nor if the fish were in the skiff with all digniti gone there would be no question either,hemingway
13067,13068,but they were sail togeth lash side by side and the old man thought let him bring me in if it pleas him,i am onli better than him through trickeri and he meant me no harm,hemingway
13069,13070,they sail well and the old man soak hi hand in the salt water and tri to keep hi head clear,there were high cumulu cloud and enough cirru abov them so that the old man knew the breez would last all night,hemingway
13071,13072,the old man look at the fish constantli to make sure it wa true,it wa an hour befor the first shark hit him,hemingway
13073,13074,the shark wa not an accid,he had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settl and dispers in the mile deep sea,hemingway
13075,13076,he had come up so fast and absolut without caution that he broke the surfac of the blue water and wa in the sun,then he fell back into the sea and pick up the scent and start swim on the cours the skiff and the fish had taken,hemingway
13077,13078,sometim he lost the scent,but he would pick it up again or have just a trace of it and he swam fast and hard on the cours,hemingway
13079,13080,he wa a veri big mako shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everyth about him wa beauti except hi jaw,hi back wa as blue as a sword fish s and hi belli wa silver and hi hide wa smooth and handsom,hemingway
13081,13082,he wa built as a sword fish except for hi huge jaw which were tight shut now as he swam fast just under the surfac with hi high dorsal fin knife through the water without waver,insid the close doubl lip of hi jaw all of hi eight row of teeth were slant inward,hemingway
13083,13084,they were not the ordinari pyramidshap teeth of most shark,they were shape like a man s finger when they are crisp like claw,hemingway
13085,13086,they were nearli as long as the finger of the old man and they had razorsharp cut edg on both side,thi wa a fish built to feed on all the fish in the sea that were so fast and strong and well arm that they had no other enemi,hemingway
13087,13088,now he speed up as he smell the fresher scent and hi blue dorsal fin cut the water,when the old man saw him come he knew that thi wa a shark that had no fear at all and would do exactli what he wish,hemingway
13089,13090,he prepar the harpoon and made the rope fast while he watch the shark come on,the rope wa short as it lack what he had cut away to lash the fish,hemingway
13091,13092,the old man s head wa clear and good now and he wa full of resolut but he had littl hope,it wa too good to last he thought,hemingway
13093,13094,he took one look at the great fish as he watch the shark close in,it might as well have been a dream he thought,hemingway
13095,13096,i can not keep him from hit me but mayb i can get him,dentuso he thought,hemingway
13097,13098,bad luck to your mother,the shark close fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw hi mouth open and hi strang eye and the click chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just abov the tail,hemingway
13099,13100,the shark s head wa out of water and hi back wa come out and the old man could hear the nois of skin and flesh rip on the big fish when he ram the harpoon down onto the shark s head at a spot where the line between hi eye intersect with the line that ran straight back from hi nose,there were no such line,hemingway
13101,13102,there wa onli the heavi sharp blue head and the big eye and the click thrust allswallow jaw,but that wa the locat of the brain and the old man hit it,hemingway
13103,13104,he hit it with hi blood mush hand drive a good harpoon with all hi strength,he hit it without hope but with resolut and complet malign,hemingway
13105,13106,the shark swung over and the old man saw hi eye wa not aliv and then he swung over onc again wrap himself in two loop of the rope,the old man knew that he wa dead but the shark would not accept it,hemingway
13107,13108,then on hi back with hi tail lash and hi jaw click the shark plow over the water as a speedboat doe,the water wa white where hi tail beat it and threequart of hi bodi wa clear abov the water when the rope came taut shiver and then snap,hemingway
13109,13110,the shark lay quietli for a littl while on the surfac and the old man watch him,then he went down veri slowli,hemingway
13111,13112,he took about forti pound the old man said aloud,he took my harpoon too and all the rope he thought and now my fish bleed again and there will be other,hemingway
13113,13114,he did not like to look at the fish anymor sinc he had been mutil,when the fish had been hit it wa as though he himself were hit,hemingway
13115,13116,but i kill the shark that hit my fish he thought,and he wa the biggest dentuso that i have ever seen,hemingway
13117,13118,and god know that i have seen big one,it wa too good to last he thought,hemingway
13119,13120,i wish it had been a dream now and that i had never hook the fish and wa alon in bed on the newspap,but man is not made for defeat he said,hemingway
13121,13122,a man can be destroy but not defeated i am sorri that i kill the fish though he thought,now the bad time is come and i do not even have the harpoon,hemingway
13123,13124,the dentuso is cruel and abl and strong and intellig,but i wa more intellig than he wa,hemingway
13125,13126,perhap not he thought,perhap i wa onli better arm,hemingway
13127,13128,don t think old man he said aloud,becaus it is all i have left,hemingway
13129,13130,that and basebal,i wonder how the great dimaggio would have like the way i hit him in the brain,hemingway
13131,13132,it wa no great thing he thought,ani man could do it,hemingway
13133,13134,but do you think my hand were as great a handicap as the bone spur,i can not know,hemingway
13135,13136,i never had anyth wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it when i step on him when swim and paralyz the lower leg and made the unbear pain,think about someth cheer old man he said,hemingway

13143,13144,it is silli not to hope he thought,besid i believ it is a sin,hemingway
13145,13146,do not think about sin he thought,there are enough problem now without sin,hemingway
13147,13148,also i have no understand of it,i have no understand of it and i am not sure that i believ in it,hemingway
13149,13150,perhap it wa a sin to kill the fish,i suppos it wa even though i did it to keep me aliv and feed mani peopl,hemingway
13151,13152,but then everyth is a sin,do not think about sin,hemingway
13153,13154,it is much too late for that and there are peopl who are paid to do it,let them think about it,hemingway
13155,13156,you were born to be a fisherman as the fish wa born to be a fish,san pedro wa a fisherman as wa the father of the great dimaggio,hemingway
13157,13158,but he like to think about all thing that he wa involv in and sinc there wa noth to read and he did not have a radio he thought much and he kept on think about sin,you did not kill the fish onli to keep aliv and to sell for food he thought,hemingway
13159,13160,you kill him for pride and becaus you are a fisherman,you love him when he wa aliv and you love him after,hemingway
13161,13162,if you love him it is not a sin to kill him,or is it more,hemingway
13163,13164,you think too much old man he said aloud,but you enjoy kill the dentuso he thought,hemingway
13165,13166,he live on the live fish as you do,he is not a scaveng nor just a move appetit as some shark are,hemingway
13167,13168,he is beauti and nobl and know no fear of anyth,i kill him in selfdefens the old man said aloud,hemingway
13169,13170,fish kill me exactli as it keep me aliv,the boy keep me aliv he thought,hemingway
13171,13172,i must not deceiv myself too much,he lean over the side and pull loos a piec of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut him,hemingway
13173,13174,he chew it and note it qualiti and it good tast,it wa firm and juici like meat but it wa not red,hemingway
13175,13176,there wa no stringi in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market,but there wa no way to keep it scent out of the water and the old man knew that a veri bad time wa come,hemingway
13177,13178,the breez wa steadi,it had back a littl further into the northeast and he knew that meant that it would not fall off,hemingway
13179,13180,the old man look ahead of him but he could see no sail nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of ani ship,there were onli the fli fish that went up from hi bow sail away to either side and the yellow patch of gulf weed,hemingway
13181,13182,he could not even see a bird,he had sail for two hour rest in the stern and sometim chew a bit of the meat from the marlin tri to rest and to be strong when he saw the first of the two shark,hemingway
13183,13184,ay he said aloud,there is no translat for thi word and perhap it is just a nois such as a man might make involuntarili feel the nail go through hi hand and into the wood,hemingway
13185,13186,galano he said aloud,he had seen the second fin now come up behind the first and had identifi them as shovelnos shark by the brown triangular fin and the sweep movement of the tail,hemingway
13187,13188,they had the scent and were excit and in the stupid of their great hunger they were lose and find the scent in their excit,but they were close all the time,hemingway
13189,13190,the old man made the sheet fast and jam the tiller,then he took up the oar with the knife lash to it,hemingway
13191,13192,he lift it as lightli as he could becaus hi hand rebel at the pain,then he open and close them on it lightli to loosen them,hemingway
13193,13194,he close them firmli so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watch the shark come,he could see their wide flatten shovelpoint head now and their whitetip wide pector fin,hemingway
13195,13196,they were hate shark bad smell scaveng as well as killer and when they were hungri they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat,it wa these shark that would cut the turtl leg and flipper off when the turtl were asleep on the surfac and they would hit a man in the water if they were hungri even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him,hemingway
13197,13198,ay the old man said,galano,hemingway
13199,13200,but they did not come as the mako had come,one turn and went out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerk and pull on the fish,hemingway
13201,13202,the other watch the old man with hi slit yellow eye and then came in fast with hi half circl of jaw wide to hit the fish where he had alreadi been bitten,the line show clearli on the top of hi brown head and back where the brain join the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the junctur withdrew it and drove it in again into the shark s yellow catlik eye,hemingway
13203,13204,the shark let go of the fish and slid down swallow what he had taken as he die,the skiff wa still shake with the destruct the other shark wa do to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadsid and bring the shark out from under,hemingway
13205,13206,when he saw the shark he lean over the side and punch at him,he hit onli meat and the hide wa set hard and he bare got the knife in,hemingway
13207,13208,the blow hurt not onli hi hand but hi shoulder too,but the shark came up fast with hi head out and the old man hit him squar in the center of hi flattop head as hi nose came out of water and lay against the fish,hemingway
13209,13210,the old man withdrew the blade and punch the shark exactli in the same spot again,he still hung to the fish with hi jaw hook and the old man stab him in hi left eye,hemingway
13211,13212,the shark still hung there,no the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebra and the brain,hemingway
13213,13214,it wa an easi shot now and he felt the cartilag sever,the old man revers the oar and put the blade between the shark s jaw to open them,hemingway
13215,13216,he twist the blade and as the shark slid loos he said go on galano,slide down a mile deep,hemingway
13217,13218,then he found the sheet and the sail fill and he brought the skiff onto her cours,they must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat he said aloud,hemingway
13219,13220,i wish it were a dream and that i had never hook him,i m sorri about it fish,hemingway
13221,13222,it make everyth wrong he stop and he did not want to look at the fish now,drain of blood and awash he look the colour of the silver back of a mirror and hi stripe still show,hemingway
13223,13224,i shouldn t have gone out so far fish he said,neither for you nor for me,hemingway
13225,13226,look to the lash on the knife and see if it ha been cut,then get your hand in order becaus there still is more to come,hemingway
13227,13228,i wish i had a stone for the knife the old man said after he had check the lash on the oar butt,i should have brought a stone you should have brought mani thing he thought,hemingway
13229,13230,but you did not bring them old man,now is no time to think of what you do not have,hemingway
13231,13232,think of what you can do with what there is,you give me much good counsel he said aloud,hemingway
13233,13234,god know how much that last one took he said,but she s much lighter now he did not want to think of the mutil undersid of the fish,hemingway
13235,13236,he knew that each of the jerk bump of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all shark as wide as a highway through the sea,he wa a fish to keep a man all winter he thought,hemingway
13237,13238,don t think of that,just rest and tri to get your hand in shape to defend what is left of him,hemingway
13239,13240,the blood smell from my hand mean noth now with all that scent in the water,besid they do not bleed much,hemingway
13241,13242,there is noth cut that mean anyth,the bleed may keep the left from cramp,hemingway
13243,13244,what can i think of now,he thought,hemingway
13245,13246,noth,i must think of noth and wait for the next one,hemingway
13247,13248,i wish it had realli been a dream he thought,but who know,hemingway
13249,13250,it might have turn out well,the next shark that came wa a singl shovelnos,hemingway
13251,13252,he came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it,the old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar down into hi brain,hemingway
13253,13254,but the shark jerk backward as he roll and the knife blade snap,the old man settl himself to steer,hemingway
13255,13256,he did not even watch the big shark sink slowli in the water show first lifes then small then tini,that alway fascin the old man,hemingway
13257,13258,but he did not even watch it now,i have the gaff now he said,hemingway
13259,13260,but it will do no good,i am too old to club shark to death,hemingway
13261,13262,but i will tri it as long as i have the oar and the short club and the tiller,he put hi hand in the water again to soak them,hemingway
13263,13264,it wa get late in the afternoon and he saw noth but the sea and the sky,there wa more wind in the sky than there had been and soon he hope that he would see land,hemingway
13265,13266,you re tire old man he said,the old man saw the brown fin come along the wide trail the fish must make in the water,hemingway
13267,13268,they were not even quarter on the scent,they were head straight for the skiff swim side by side,hemingway
13269,13270,he jam the tiller made the sheet fast and reach under the stern for the club,it wa an oar handl from a broken oar saw off to about two and a half feet in length,hemingway
13271,13272,he could onli use it effect with one hand becaus of the grip of the handl and he took good hold of it with hi right hand flex hi hand on it as he watch the shark come,they were both galano,hemingway
13273,13274,i must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head he thought,the two shark close togeth and as he saw the one nearest him open hi jaw and sink them into the silver side of the fish he rais the club high and brought it down heavi and slam onto the top of the shark s broad head,hemingway
13275,13276,he felt the rubberi solid as the club came down,but he felt the rigid of bone too and he struck the shark onc more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish,hemingway
13277,13278,the other shark had been in and out and now came in again with hi jaw wide,the old man could see piec of the meat of the fish spill white from the corner of hi jaw as he bump the fish and close hi jaw,hemingway
13279,13280,he swung at him and hit onli the head and the shark look at him and wrench the meat loos,the old man swung the club down on him again as he slip away to swallow and hit onli the heavi solid rubberi,hemingway
13281,13282,come on galano the old man said,he hit him solidli and from as high up as he could rais the club,hemingway
13283,13284,thi time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loos sluggishli and slid down from the fish,the old man watch for him to come again but neither shark show,hemingway
13285,13286,then he saw one on the surfac swim in circl,he did not see the fin of the other,hemingway
13287,13288,i could not expect to kill them he thought,i could have in my time,hemingway
13289,13290,but i have hurt them both badli and neither one can feel veri good,if i could have use a bat with two hand i could have kill the first one sure,hemingway
13291,13292,even now he thought,he did not want to look at the fish,hemingway
13293,13294,he knew that half of him had been destroy,the sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the shark,hemingway
13295,13296,it will be dark soon he said,then i should see the glow of havana,hemingway
13297,13298,i hope no one ha been too worri,there is onli the boy to worri of cours,hemingway
13299,13300,but i am sure he would have confid,mani of the older fishermen will worri,hemingway
13301,13302,mani other too he thought,i live in a good town,hemingway

13357,13358,they came in a pack and he could onli see the line in the water that their fin made and their phosphoresc as they threw themselv on the fish,he club at head and heard the jaw chop and the shake of the skiff as they took hold below,hemingway
13359,13360,he club desper at what he could onli feel and hear and he felt someth seiz the club and it wa gone,he jerk the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chop with it hold it in both hand and drive it down again and again,hemingway
13361,13362,but they were up to the bow now and drive in one after the other and togeth tear off the piec of meat that show glow below the sea as they turn to come onc more,one came final against the head itself and he knew that it wa over,hemingway
13363,13364,he swung the tiller across the shark s head where the jaw were caught in the heavi of the fish s head which would not tear,he swung it onc and twice and again,hemingway
13365,13366,he heard the tiller break and he lung at the shark with the splinter butt,he felt it go in and know it wa sharp he drove it in again,hemingway
13367,13368,the shark let go and roll away,that wa the last shark of the pack that came,hemingway
13369,13370,there wa noth more for them to eat,the old man could hardli breath now and he felt a strang tast in hi mouth,hemingway
13371,13372,it wa copperi and sweet and he wa afraid of it for a moment,but there wa not much of it,hemingway
13373,13374,he spat into the ocean and said eat that galano,he settl the sack around hi shoulder and put the skiff on her cours,hemingway
13375,13376,he sail lightli now and he had no thought nor ani feel of ani kind,he wa past everyth now and he sail the skiff to make hi home port as well and as intellig as he could,hemingway
13377,13378,in the night shark hit the carcass as someon might pick up crumb from the tabl,the old man paid no attent to them and did not pay ani attent to anyth except steer,hemingway
13379,13380,he onli notic how lightli and how well the skiff sail now there wa no great weight besid her,she s good he thought,hemingway

13387,13388,and the great sea with our friend and our enemi,and bed he thought,hemingway
13389,13390,bed is my friend,just bed he thought,hemingway
13391,13392,bed will be a great thing,it is easi when you are beaten he thought,hemingway

13395,13396,noth he said aloud,the breez had risen steadili and wa blow strongli now,hemingway
13397,13398,it wa quiet in the harbour though and he sail up onto the littl patch of shingl below the rock,there wa no one to help him so he pull the boat up as far as he could,hemingway
13399,13400,then he step out and made her fast to a rock,he unstep the mast and furl the sail and tie it,hemingway
13401,13402,then he shoulder the mast and start to climb,it wa then he knew the depth of hi tired,hemingway
13403,13404,he stop for a moment and look back and saw in the reflect from the street light the great tail of the fish stand up well behind the skiff s stern,he saw the white nake line of hi backbon and the dark mass of the head with the project bill and all the naked between,hemingway
13405,13406,he start to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across hi shoulder,he tri to get up,hemingway

13425,13426,sleep the boy call,he did not care that they saw him cri,hemingway
13427,13428,i believ it the boy said,he went into the terrac and ask for a can of coffe,hemingway

13453,13454,that afternoon there wa a parti of tourist at the terrac and look down in the water among the empti beer can and dead barracuda a woman saw a great long white spine with a huge tail at the end that lift and swung with the tide while the east wind blew a heavi steadi sea outsid the entranc to the harbour,what s that she ask a waiter and point to the long backbon of the great fish that wa now just garbag wait to go out with the tide,hemingway
13455,13456,tiburon the waiter said,eshark he wa mean to explain what had happen,hemingway
13457,13458,up the road in hi shack the old man wa sleep again,he wa still sleep on hi face and the boy wa sit by him watch him,hemingway
13459,13460,the old man wa dream about the lion,you will meet them do variou thing with resolv but their interest rare hold becaus after the other thing ordinari life is as flat as the tast of wine when the tast bud have been burn off your tongu,hemingway
13461,13462,wine when your tongu ha been burn clean with lye and water feel like puddl water in your mouth while mustard feel like axlegreas and you can smell crisp fri bacon but when you tast it there is onli a feel of crinkli lard,you can learn about thi matter of the tongu by come into the kitchen of a villa on the riviera late at night and take a drink from what should be a bottl of evian water and which turn out to be eau de javel a concentr lye product use for clean sink,hemingway
13463,13464,the tast bud on your tongu if burn off by eau de javel will begin to function again after about a week,at what rate other thing regener one doe not know sinc you lose track of friend and the thing one could learn in a week were mostli learn a long time ago,hemingway
13465,13466,the other night i wa talk with a good friend to whom all hunt is dull except eleph hunt,to him there is no sport in anyth unless there is great danger and if the danger is not enough he will increas it for hi own satisfact,hemingway
13467,13468,a hunt companion of hi had told me how thi friend wa not satisfi with the risk of ordinari eleph hunt but would if possibl have the eleph driven or turn so he could take them headon so it wa a choic of kill them with the difficult frontal shot as they came trumpet with their ear spread or have them run over him,thi is to eleph hunt what the german cult of suicid climb is to ordinari mountain and i suppos it is in a way an attempt to approxim the old hunt of the arm man who is hunt you,hemingway
13469,13470,thi friend wa speak of eleph hunt and urg me to hunt eleph as he said that onc you took it up no other hunt would mean anyth to you,i wa argu that i enjoy all hunt and shoot ani sort i could get and had no desir to wipe thi capac for enjoy out with the eau de javel of the old eleph come straight at you with hi trunk up and hi ear spread,hemingway
13471,13472,of cours you like that big fish too he said rather sadli,he s an eleph hunter and thi last year he s gone fish for big fish and he s goofi about it,hemingway
13473,13474,there must be someth about it but i can t see it,i wish you would he said,hemingway
13475,13476,becaus you peopl are sensibl on other subject,onc you are out of sight of land and of the other boat you are more alon than you can ever be hunt and the sea is the same as it ha been sinc befor men ever went on it in boat,hemingway
13477,13478,in a season fish you will see it oili flat as the becalm galleon saw it while they drift to the westward whitecap with a fresh breez as they saw it run with the trade and in high roll blue hill the top blow off them like snow as they were punish by it so that sometim you will see three great hill of water with your fish jump from the top of the farthest one and if you tri to make a turn to go with him without pick your chanc one of those break crest would roar down in on you with a thousand ton of water and you would hunt no more eleph richard my lad,there is no danger from the fish but anyon who goe on the sea the year around in a small power boat doe not seek danger,hemingway
13479,13480,you may be absolut sure that in a year you will have it without seek so you tri alway to avoid it all you can,becaus the gulf stream is an unexploit countri onli the veri fring of it ever be fish and then onli at a dozen place in thousand of mile of current no one know what fish live in it or how great size they reach or what age or even what kind of fish and anim live in it at differ depth,hemingway
13481,13482,when you are drift out of sight of land fish four line sixti eighti one hundr and one hundr fifti fathom down in water that is seven hundr fathom deep you never know what may take the small tuna that you use for bait and everi time the line start to run off the reel slowli first then with a scream of the click as the rod bend and you feel it doubl and the huge weight of the friction of the line rush through that depth of water while you pump and reel pump and reel pump and reel tri to get the belli out of the line befor the fish jump there is alway a thrill that need no danger to make it real,it may be a marlin that will jump high and clear off to your right and then go off in a seri of leap throw a splash like a speedboat in a sea as you shout for the boat to turn with him watch the line melt off the reel befor the boat can get around,hemingway
13483,13484,or it may be a broadbil that will show wag hi great broadsword,or it may be some fish that you will never see at all that will head straight out to the northwest like a submerg submarin and never show and at the end of five hour the angler ha a straightenedout hook,hemingway
13485,13486,there is alway a feel of excit when a fish take hold when you are drift deep,in hunt you know what you are after and the top you can get is an eleph,hemingway
13487,13488,but who can say what you will hook sometim when drift in a hundr and fifti fathom in the gulf stream,there are probabl marlin and swordfish to which the fish we have seen caught are pygmi and everi time a fish take the bait drift you have a feel perhap you are hook to one of these,hemingway
13489,13490,carlo our cuban mate who is fiftythre year old and ha been fish for marlin sinc he went in the bow of a skiff with hi father when he wa seven wa fish drift deep one time when he hook a white marlin,the fish jump twice and then sound and when he sound suddenli carlo felt a great weight and he could not hold the line which went out and down and down irresist until the fish had taken out over a hundr and fifti fathom,hemingway
13491,13492,carlo say it felt as heavi and solid as though he were hook to the bottom of the sea,then suddenli the strain wa loosen but he could feel the weight of hi origin fish and pull it up stone dead,hemingway
13493,13494,some toothless fish like a swordfish or marlin had close hi jaw across the middl of the eightypound white marlin and squeez it and held it so that everi bit of the insid of the fish had been crush out while the huge fish move off with the eightypound fish in it mouth,final it let go,hemingway
13495,13496,what size of a fish would that be,i thought it might be a giant squid but carlo said there were no sucker mark on the fish and that it show plainli the shape of the marlin s mouth where he had crush it,hemingway
13497,13498,anoth time an old man fish alon in a skiff out of cabaña hook a great marlin that on the heavi sashcord handlin pull the skiff far out to sea,two day later the old man wa pick up by fishermen sixti mile to the eastward the head and forward part of the marlin lash alongsid,hemingway
13499,13500,what wa left of the fish less than half weigh eight hundr pound,the old man had stay with him a day a night a day and anoth night while the fish swam deep and pull the boat,hemingway
13501,13502,when he had come up the old man had pull the boat up on him and harpoon him,lash alongsid the shark had hit him and the old man had fought them out alon in the gulf stream in a skiff club them stab at them lung at them with an oar until he wa exhaust and the shark had eaten all that they could hold,hemingway
13503,13504,he wa cri in the boat when the fishermen pick him up half crazi from hi loss and the shark were still circl the boat,but what is the excit in catch them from a launch,hemingway
13505,13506,it come from the fact that they are strang and wild thing of unbeliev speed and power and a beauti in the water and leap that is indescrib which you would never see if you did not fish for them and to which you are suddenli har so that you feel their speed their forc and their savag power as intim as if you were ride a buck hors,for half an hour an hour or five hour you are fasten to the fish as much as he is fasten to you and you tame him and break him the way a wild hors is broken and final lead him to the boat,hemingway
13507,13508,for pride and becaus the fish is worth plenti of money in the havana market you gaff him at the boat and bring him on board but the have him in the boat isn t the excit it is while you are fight him that is the fun,if the fish is hook in the boni part of the mouth i am sure the hook hurt him no more than the har hurt the angler,hemingway
13509,13510,a larg fish when he is hook often doe not feel the hook at all and will swim toward the boat unconcern to take anoth bait,at other time he will swim away deep complet unconsci of the hook and it is when he feel himself held and pressur exert to turn him that he know someth is wrong and start to make hi fight,hemingway
13511,13512,unless he is hook where it hurt he make hi fight not against the pain of the hook but against be captur and if when he is out of sight you figur what he is do in what direct he is pull when deep down and whi you can convinc him and bring him to the boat by the same system you break a wild hors,it is not necessari to kill him or even complet exhaust him to bring him to the boat,hemingway
13513,13514,to kill a fish that fight deep you pull against the direct he want to go until he is worn out and die,it take hour and when the fish die the shark are liabl to get him befor the angler can rais him to the top,hemingway
13515,13516,to catch such a fish quickli you figur by tri to hold him absolut which direct he is work a sound fish is go in the direct the line slant in the water when you have put enough pressur on the drag so the line would break if you held it ani tighter then get ahead of him on that direct and he can be brought to the boat without kill him,you do not tow him or pull him with the motor boat you use the engin to shift your posit just as you would walk up or down stream with a salmon,hemingway
13517,13518,a fish is caught most sure from a small boat such as a dori sinc the angler can shut down on hi drag and simpli let the fish pull the boat,tow the boat will kill him in time,hemingway
13519,13520,but the most satisfact is to domin and convinc the fish and bring him intact in everyth but spirit to the boat as rapidli as possibl,veri instruct say the friend,hemingway
13521,13522,marlin carlo yell from the top of the hous and stamp hi feet up and down the signal that a fish is rais,he swarm down to the wheel and you go back to where the rod rest in it socket and there come the shadow again fast as the shadow of a plane move over the water and the spear head fin and shoulder smash out of water and you hear the click the closepin make as the line pull out and the long bight of line whish through the water as the fish turn and as you hold the rod you feel it doubl and the butt kick you in the belli as you come back hard and feel hi weight as you strike him again and again and again,hemingway
13523,13524,then the heavi rod arc out toward the fish and the reel in a bandsaw zing scream the marlin leap clear and long silver in the sun long round as a hogshead and band with lavend stripe and when he goe into the water it throw a column of spray like a shell light,then he come out again and the spray roar and again then the line feel slack and out he burst head across and in then jump wildli twice more seem to hang high and stiff in the air befor fall to throw the column of water and you can see the hook in the corner of hi jaw,hemingway
13525,13526,then in a seri of jump like a greyhound he head to the northwest and stand up you follow him in the boat the line taut as a banjo string and littl drop come from it until you final get the belli of it clear of that friction against the water and have a straight pull out toward the fish,and all the time carlo is shout oh god the bread of my children,hemingway
13527,13528,oh look at the bread of my children,joseph and mari look at the bread of my children jump,hemingway
13529,13530,there it goe the bread of my children,then he sound and i said to carlo get me the har,hemingway

13535,13536,never say julio,thou and thi never say carlo,hemingway
13537,13538,the fish is nearli whip now and the dead ach is out of rais him and then while lift i feel someth slip,it hold for an instant and then the line is slack,hemingway
13539,13540,he s gone i say and unbuckl the har,the bread of your children julio say to carlo,hemingway

13549,13550,everi time he jump the hook cut the hole a littl bigger in hi jaw,ay how he could jump,hemingway
13551,13552,don t talk about that ani more said carlo,no it is not eleph hunt,hemingway
13553,13554,but we get a kick out of it,when you have a famili and children your famili or my famili or the famili of carlo you do not have to look for danger,hemingway
13555,13556,there is alway plenti of danger when you have a famili,and after a while the danger of other is the onli danger and there is no end to it nor ani pleasur in it nor doe it help to think about it,hemingway
13557,13558,but there is great pleasur in be on the sea in the unknown wild sudden of a great fish in hi life and death which he live for you in an hour while your strength is har to hi and there is satisfact in conquer thi thing which rule the sea it live in,then in the morn of the day after you have caught a good fish when the man who carri him to the market in a handcart bring the long roll of heavi silver dollar wrap in a newspap on board it is veri satisfactori money,hemingway

13715,13716,ernesto here want a waiter,they re in polit and in a year like this they were impress and a littl frighten,hemingway
13717,13718,in the morn when the first daylight from across the bay woke me i got up and start to write on a stori that i hope mr,josi would like,hemingway
13719,13720,it had the anita in it and the water front and the thing we knew that had happen and i tri to get into it the feel of the sea and the thing we saw and smelt and heard and felt each day,i work on the stori everi morn and we fish each day and caught good fish,hemingway
13721,13722,i train hard and fought all the fish stand instead of sit in a chair,and still the big fish had not come,hemingway
13723,13724,one day we saw one tow a commerci fisherman s dinghi with the dinghi down by the bow and the marlin make splash as a speed boat would each time he jump,that one broke off,hemingway
13725,13726,one day in a rain squall we saw four men tri to hoist one wide and deep and dark purpl into a skiff,that marlin dress out five hundr pound and i saw the huge steak cut from him on the marbl slab in the old market,hemingway
13727,13728,then on a sunni day with a heavi dark stream the water so clear and in so close that you could see the shoal in the mouth of the harbour ten fathom deep we hit our first big fish just outsid the morro,in those day there were no outrigg and no rod holder and i wa just let out a light rig hope to pick up a kingfish in the channel when thi fish hit,hemingway
13729,13730,he came out in a surg and hi bill look like a sawedoff billiard cue,behind it hi head show huge and wide and he look as wide as a dinghi,hemingway
13731,13732,then he pass us in a rush with the line cut parallel to the boat and the reel empti so fast that it wa hot to the touch,there were four hundr yard of fifteen thread line on the reel and half of it wa gone by the time i had gotten into the bow of the anita,hemingway
13733,13734,i got there by hold onto handhold we had built into the top of the hous,we had practic thi run forward and the scrambl over the forward deck to where you could brace against the stem of the boat with your feet,hemingway
13735,13736,but we had never practic it with a fish that pass you like a subway express when you are at a local station and with one arm hold the rod buck and dig into the butt rest and with the other hand and both bare feet brake on the deck as the fish haul you forward,hook her up josi i yell,hemingway
13737,13738,carlo wa hold me around the waist and ahead of us the fish wa jump,he look as big around as a big wine barrel when he jump,hemingway
13739,13740,he wa silver in the bright sun and i could see the broad purpl stripe down hi side,each time he jump he made a splash like a hors fall off a cliff and he jump and jump and jump,hemingway
13741,13742,the reel wa too hot to hold and the core of line on it wa get thinner and thinner in spite of the anita go full speed after the fish,can you get ani more out of her i call to mr,hemingway
13743,13744,josi,not in thi world he said,hemingway
13745,13746,he s the biggest marlin i ve ever seen,if he ll onli stop,hemingway
13747,13748,if he ll onli go down,that is about the way we went,hemingway
13749,13750,then with less than twenti yard of line on the reel he stop and we ran up on him recov line all the time,i rememb that there wa a grace line ship ahead of us with the black pilot boat go out to her and i wa worri that we might be on her cours as she came in,hemingway
13751,13752,then i rememb watch her while i reel and then work my way back to the stern and watch the ship pick up her speed,she wa come in well outsid of us and the pilot boat would not foul us either,hemingway
13753,13754,now i wa in the chair and the fish wa straight up and down and we had a third of the line on the reel,carlo had pour sea water on the reel to cool it and he pour a bucket of water over my head and shoulder,hemingway
13755,13756,how are you do cap mr,josi ask,hemingway
13757,13758,grand carlo kept say,he wa trembl like a bird dog a good bird dog,hemingway
13759,13760,i ve never seen such a fish,never,hemingway
13761,13762,never,the current wa veri strong and it had carri us down to opposit cojimar which is about six mile from where the fish first sound,hemingway
13763,13764,i wa tire but my hand and feet were in good shape and i wa get line on him now quit steadili be care never to pull harshli nor to jerk,i could move him now,hemingway
13765,13766,it wasn t easi,but it wa possibl if you kept the line just thi side of the break point,hemingway
13767,13768,he s go to come up carlo said,he s puzzl carlo said,hemingway
13769,13770,and you re lead him,he ll weigh dress out carlo said,hemingway
13771,13772,keep your mouth off of him mr,josi said,hemingway
13773,13774,you can not say it wa frighten,but it wa awesom,hemingway
13775,13776,we saw him slow and quiet and almost unmov in the water with hi great pector fin like two long purpl scyth blade,then he saw the boat and the line start to race off the reel as though we were hook to a motor car and he start jump out to the northwest with the water pour from him at each jump,hemingway
13777,13778,i had to go into the bow again and we chase him until he sound,thi time he went down almost opposit the morro,hemingway
13779,13780,then i work my way back to the stern again,do you want a drink cap mr,hemingway
13781,13782,josi ask,no i said,hemingway
13783,13784,when i got back to the stern and could sit down again mr,but now when i lift it did not straighten as it should,hemingway
13785,13786,she s still got some left mr,josi said,hemingway
13787,13788,you can stick with him forev cap,i m worri about the rod,hemingway
13789,13790,he s tire carlo said,he s go to come in easi now,hemingway
13791,13792,the rod s tip now touch the surfac of the water and when you lift to rais the fish and to reel to take up line the rod did not react,it wa not a rod anymor,hemingway
13793,13794,it wa like a project of the line,it wa still possibl to gain a few inch of line each time you lift,hemingway
13795,13796,but that wa all,the fish wa move in slow circl and as he move on the outgo half of the circl he took line off of the reel,hemingway
13797,13798,on the incom circl you gain it back,but with the temper gone out of the rod you could not punish him and you had no command over him at all,hemingway
13799,13800,it s bad cap i said to mr,josi,hemingway
13801,13802,he say he caught so much air jump he can t go deep and die,he say thi is the way the big one alway act at the end when they ve jump a lot,hemingway
13803,13804,josi make and i wa impress,just then the big fish start down and down and down,hemingway
13805,13806,i wa brake with both hand on the drum of the reel and keep the line almost at break point and feel the metal of the reel drum revolv in slow jerk under my finger,how s the time i ask mr,hemingway
13807,13808,josi,hemingway he ha to come up,hemingway
13809,13810,get him some water carlo mr,josi said,hemingway
13811,13812,the sweat salt the place on my shoulder where the har had rub them bare but it wa so hot in the sun that there wa no warm feel from the blood,it wa a juli day and the sun wa at noon,hemingway
13813,13814,put some more salt water on hi head mr,josi said,hemingway
13815,13816,he hung steadi for a time feel as solid as though you were hook to a concret pier and then slowli he start up,i recov the line reel with the wrist alon as there wa no spring in the rod at all and it wa limp as a weep willow,hemingway
13817,13818,when the fish wa about a fathom under the surfac so that we could see him look like a long purpl stripe cano with two great jut wing he start to circl slowli,i held all the tension i could on him to tri and shorten the circl,hemingway
13819,13820,i wa hold up to that absolut hard that indic the break strength of the line when the rod let go,it did not break sharpli or suddenli,hemingway
13821,13822,it just collaps,cut thirti fathom of line off the big rig i said to carlo,hemingway
13823,13824,but he wa a whip fish now and on the heavi gear we should get him,the onli problem wa that the big rod wa too stiff for the fifteen thread line,hemingway
13825,13826,that wa my problem and i would have to work it out,carlo wa strip white thirti six thread line off the big hardi reel measur it with hi arm extend as he pull it out through the guid of the rod and drop it on the deck,hemingway
13827,13828,i held the fish all that i could with the useless rod and saw carlo cut the white line and pull a long length of it through the guid,all right cap i said to mr,hemingway
13829,13830,josi,you take thi line now when he come in on hi circl and take in enough so carlo can make the two line fast,hemingway
13831,13832,josi brought the line in foot by foot and pass it to carlo who wa knot it to the white line,he s got them tie mr,hemingway
13833,13834,josi said,he still had about a yard of the green fifteen thread line to spare and wa hold the live line in hi finger as the fish came to the insid limit of hi circl,hemingway
13835,13836,i broke my hand loos from the small rod laid it down and took the big rod that carlo hand me,cut away when you are readi i said to carlo,hemingway
13837,13838,to mr,then i heard a cri such as i have never heard a sane human be make,hemingway
13839,13840,it wa as though you could distil all of despair and make it into a sound,then i saw the green line slowli go through mr,hemingway
13841,13842,josi s finger and then watch it go on down down and out of sight,carlo had cut the wrong loop of the knot he had made,hemingway
13843,13844,the fish wa out of sight,cap mr,hemingway
13845,13846,josi said,he did not look veri well,hemingway
13847,13848,then he look at hi watch,four hour and twenti two minut he said,hemingway

13851,13852,hi brown face wa all tie up and he wa talk in a low strang voic so you could hardli hear him,all my life fish and i never saw such a fish and i did that,hemingway
13853,13854,you mustn t talk nonsens like that,we ll catch plenti of bigger fish but we never did,hemingway

21059,21060,it wa as silli for him to think that he could trail with hi father as to think he could fight with him,he knew too that it wa not just that they were men,hemingway
21061,21062,they were profession hunter and he knew now that wa whi juma would not even wast a smile,they knew everyth the eleph had done point out the sign of it to each other without speak and when the track becam difficult hi father alway yield to juma,hemingway
21063,21064,when they stop to fill the water bottl at a stream hi father said just last the day out davey,then when they were final past the broken countri and climb again toward the forest the track of the eleph turn off to the right onto an old eleph trail,hemingway

21071,21072,david had kill two spur fowl with hi slingshot out of a small flock that had walk across the trail just befor the sunset,the bird had come into the old eleph trail to dust walk neatli and plumpli and when the pebbl broke the back of one and the bird began to jerk and toss with it wing thump anoth bird ran forward to peck at it and david pouch anoth pebbl and pull it back and sent it against the rib of the second bird,hemingway
21073,21074,as he ran forward to put hi hand on it the other bird whir off,juma had look back and smile thi time and david pick up the two bird warm and plump and smoothli feather and knock their head against the handl of hi hunt knife,hemingway

21077,21078,juma cook the bird spit on a stick over the coal of a veri small fire,hi father drank a whiskey and water from the cup top of hi flask as they lay and watch juma cook afterward juma gave them each a breast with the heart in it and ate the two neck and back and the leg himself,hemingway

21085,21086,it s an hour later tonight and two hour later than when you found him,whi doe juma think he know where he s go,hemingway
21087,21088,he wound him and kill hi askari not too far from here,when,hemingway
21089,21090,five year ago he say,that may mean anytim,hemingway

21103,21104,i wa veri proud of you,so wa juma,hemingway
21105,21106,in the night when he woke after the moon wa up he wa sure they were not proud of him except perhap for hi dexter in kill the two bird,he had found the eleph at night and follow him to see that he had both of hi tusk and then return to find the two men and put them on the trail,hemingway
21107,21108,david knew they were proud of that,but onc the deadli follow start he wa useless to them and a danger to their success just as kibo had been to him when he had gone up close to the eleph in the night and he knew they must each have hate themselv for not have sent him back when there wa time,hemingway
21109,21110,the tusk of the eleph weigh two hundr pound apiec,ever sinc these tusk had grown beyond their normal size the eleph had been hunt for them and now the three of them would kill him,hemingway
21111,21112,david wa sure that they would kill him now becaus he david had last through the day and kept up after the pace had destroy him by noon,so they probabl were proud of him do that,hemingway
21113,21114,but he had brought noth use to the hunt and they would have been far better off without him,mani time dure the day he had wish that he had never betray the eleph and in the afternoon he rememb wish that he had never seen him,hemingway

21119,21120,but hi feel about the eleph had been the hardest part and he knew he would have to get away from it and then come back to it to be certain it wa as it had been not later but on that day,he knew the feel had begun to form but he had been too exhaust to rememb it exactli,hemingway
21121,21122,still involv in thi problem and live in the stori he lock up hi suitcas and came out of the room onto the hagston that led down to the terrac where marita wa sit in a chair under one of the pine face out toward the sea,she wa read and as he wa walk barefoot she did not hear him,hemingway

26403,26404,she lad never been pure religi not even after that summer at the camp meet when brother whitfield wrestl with her spirit singl her out and strove with the vaniti in her mortal heart and i said to her mani a time god gave you children to comfort your hard human lot and for a token of hi own suffer and love for in love you conceiv and bore them,i said that becaus she took god s love and her duti to him too much as a matter of cours and such conduct is not pleas to him,faulkner
26405,26406,i said he gave us the gift to rais our voic in hi undi prais becaus i said there is more rejoic in heaven over one sinner than over a hundr that never sin,and she said my daili life is an acknowledg and expiat of my sin and i said who are you to say what is sin and what is not sin,faulkner
26407,26408,it is the lord s part to judg our to prais hi merci and hi holi name in the hear of our fellow mortal becaus he alon can see into the heart and just becaus a woman s me is right in the sight of man she cant know if there is no sin in her heart without she open her heart to the lord and receiv hi grace,i said just becaus you have been a faith wife is no sign that there is no sin in your heart and just becaus your me is hard is no sign that the lord s grace is absolv you,faulkner

26417,26418,but you d think from the way she talk that she knew more about sin and salvat than the lord god himself than them who have strove and labor with the sin in thi human world,when the onli sin she ever commit wa be partial to jewel that never love her and wa it own punish in prefer to darl that wa touch by god himself and consid queer by us mortal and that did love her,faulkner
26419,26420,i said there is your sin,and your punish too,faulkner

26431,26432,how do you know without you open your heart to him and lift your voic in hi prais,i said,faulkner
26433,26434,then i realis that she did not mean god,i realis that out of the vaniti of her heart she had spoken sacrileg,faulkner
26435,26436,and i went down on my knee right there,i beg her to kneel and open her heart and cast from ft the devil of vaniti and cast herself upon the merci of the lord,faulkner
26437,26438,but she would nt,she just sat there lost in her vaniti and her pride that had close her heart to god and set that selfish mortal boy in hi place,faulkner
26439,26440,kneel there i pray for her,i pray for that poor blind woman as i had never pray for me and mine,faulkner
26441,26442,it would he quiet there then with the water bubbl up and away and the sun slant quiet in the tree and the quiet smell of damp and rot leav and new earth especi in the earli spring for it wa worst then,i could just rememb how my father use to say that the reason for live wa to get readi to stay dead a long time and when i would have to look at them day after day each with hi and her secret and selfish thought and blood strang to each other blood and strang to mine and think that thi seem to be the onli way i could get readi to stay dead i would hate my father for have ever plant me,faulkner
26443,26444,i would look forward to the time when they fault so i could whip them,when the switch fell i could feel it upon my flesh when it welt and ridg it wa my blood that ran and i would think with each blow of the switch now you are awar of me now i am someth in your secret and selfish life who have mark your blood with my own for ever and ever,faulkner
26445,26446,and so i took ans,i saw him pass the school hous three or four time befor i learn that he wa drive four mile out of hi way to do it,faulkner
26447,26448,i notic then how he wa begin to hump a tall man and young so that he look alreadi like a tall bird hunch in the cold weather on the wagon seat he would pass the school hous the wagon creak slow hi head turn slow to watch the door of the school hous as the wagon pass until he went on around the curv and out of sight,one day i went to the door and stood there when he pass,faulkner
26449,26450,when he saw me he look quickli away and did not look back again,in the earli spring it wa worst,faulkner
26451,26452,sometim i thought that i could not bear it lie in bed at night with the wild gees go north and their honk come faint and high and wild out of the wild dark and dure the day it would seem as though i could nt wait for the last one to go so i could go down to the spring,i aint got none he said,faulkner
26453,26454,you have nt got ani,but you ve got a hous,faulkner
26455,26456,they tell me you ve got a hous and a good farm,and you live there alon do for yourself do you,faulkner

26463,26464,i dont reckon you can say the same,no,faulkner
26465,26466,i have peopl,in jefferson,faulkner
26467,26468,hi face fell a littl,well i got a littl properti,faulkner
26469,26470,i m forehand i got a good honest name,i know how town folk are but mayb when they talk to me,faulkner
26471,26472,they might listen i said,but they ll be hard to talk to,faulkner
26473,26474,he wa watch my face,they re in the cemeteri,faulkner
26475,26476,but your live kin he said,they ll be differ,faulkner
26477,26478,will they,i said,faulkner
26479,26480,dont know,i never had ani other kind,faulkner
26481,26482,so i took ans,and when i knew that i had cash i knew that live wa terribl and that thi wa the answer to it,faulkner
26483,26484,that wa when i learn that word are no good that word dont ever fit even what they are tri to say at,when he wa born i knew that motherhood wa invent by someon who had to have a word for it becaus the one that had the children did nt care whether there wa a word for it or not,faulkner
26485,26486,i knew that fear wa invent by someon that had never had the fear pride who never had the pride,i knew that it had been not that they had dirti nose but that we had had to use one anoth by word like spider dangl by their mouth from a beam swing and twist and never touch and that onli through the blow of die switch could my blood and their blood flow as one stream,faulkner
26487,26488,i knew that it had,been not that my alon had to be violat over and over each day but that it had never been violat until cash came,faulkner
26489,26490,not even by ans in the night,he had a word too,faulkner
26491,26492,love he call it,but i had been use to word for a long time,faulkner
26493,26494,i knew that that word wa like the other just a shape to fill a lack that when the right time came you would nt need a word for that anymor than for pride or fear,cash did not need to say it to me nor i to him and i would say let ans use it if he want to,faulkner
26495,26496,so that it wa ans or love love or ans it did nt matter,i would think that even while i lay with him in the dark and cash asleep in the cradl within the swing of my hand,faulkner
26497,26498,i would think that if he were to wake and cri i would suckl him too,ans or love it did nt matter,faulkner
26499,26500,my alon had been violat and then made whole again by the violat time ans love what you will outsid the circl,then i found that i had darl at first i would not believ it,faulkner
26501,26502,then i believ that i would kill ans,it wa as though he had trick me hidden within a word like within a paper screen and struck me in the back through it,faulkner
26503,26504,but then i realis that i had been trick by word older than ans or love and that the same word had trick ans too and that my reveng would be that he would never know i wa take reveng,and when darl wa born i ask ans to promis to take me back to jefferson when i die becaus i knew that father had been right even when he could nt have known he wa right anymor than i could have known i wa wrong,faulkner
26505,26506,nonsens ans said you and me aint nigh done chap yet with just two,he did not know that he wa dead then a sometim i would lie by him in the dark hearingdi land that wa now of my blood and flesh and i would mink ans,faulkner
26507,26508,whi ans,whi are you ans,faulkner
26509,26510,i would think about hi name until after a while i could see the word as a shape a vessel and i would watch him liquefi and flow into it like cold molass flow out of the dark into the vessel until the jar stood full and motionless a signific shape profoundli without me like an empti door frame and then i would find that i had forgotten the name of the jar,i would think the shape of my bodi where i use to be a virgin is in the shape of a and i could nt think ans could nt rememb ans,faulkner
26511,26512,it wa not that i could think of myself as no longer unvirgin becaus i wa three now,and when i would think cash and darl that way until their name would die and solidifi into a shape and then fade away i would say all light,faulkner
26513,26514,it doe nt matter,it doe nt matter what they call them,faulkner
26515,26516,and so when cora tull would tell me i wa not a true mother i would think how word go straight up in a thin line quick and harmless and how terribl do goe along the earth cling to it so that after a while the two line are too far apart for the same person to straddl from one to the other and that sin and love and fear arejust sound that peopl who never sin nor love nor fear have for what they never had and can not have until they forget the word lake cora who could never even cook,i gave ans the children,faulkner
26517,26518,i did not ask for them,i did not even ask him for what he could have given me notans,faulkner
26519,26520,that wa my duti to him to not ask that and that duti i fulfil,i would be i i would let him be the shape and echo of hi word,faulkner
26521,26522,that wa more than he ask becaus he could not have ask for that and been ans use himself so with a word,and then he die,faulkner
26523,26524,he did not know he wa dead,i would lie by him in the dark hear the dark land talk of cod s love and hi beauti and hi sin hear the dark voiceless in which the word are the deed and the other word that are not deed that are just the gap in peopl lack come down like the cri of the gees out of the wild dark in the old terribl night fumbl at the deed like orphan to whom are point out in a crowd two face and told that is your father your mother,faulkner

26527,26528,i would think of sin as i would think of the cloth we both wore in the world s face of the circumspect necessari becaus he wa he and i wa i the sin the more utter and terribl sinc he wa the instrument ordain by god who creat the sin to sanctifi that sin he had creat,while i wait for him in the wood wait for him befor he saw me i would think of him as dress in sin,faulkner
26529,26530,i would think of him as think of me as dress also in sin he the more beauti sinc the garment which he had exchang for sin wa sanctifi,i would think of the sin as garment which we would remov in order to shape and coerc the terribl blood to the forlorn echo of the dead word high in the air,faulkner

26535,26536,i mere took the precaut that he thought necessari for hi sake not for my safeti but just as i wore cloth in the world s face,and i would think then when cora talk to me of how the high dead word in time seem to lose even the signific of their dead sound,faulkner
26537,26538,then it wa over,over in the sens that he wa gone and i knew that see him again though i would i would never again see him come swift and secret to me in the wood dress in sin like a gallant garment alreadi blow asid with the speed of hi secret come,faulkner

34761,34762,i wa wonder if she d have so littl respect for me that she d not onli play out of school when i told her not to but would walk right past the store dare me not to see her,onli she could nt see into the door becaus the sun fell straight into it and it wa like tri to see through an automobil searchlight so i stood there and watch her go on past with her face paint up like a dam clown s and her hair all gum and twist and a dress that if a woman had come out door even on gayoso or beal street when i wa a young fellow with no more than that to cover her leg and behind she d been thrown in jail,faulkner
34763,34764,i ll be damn if they dont dress like they were tri to make everi man they pass on the street want to reach out and clap hi hand on it,and so i wa think what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie when all of a sudden i knew he wa one of those show folk well as if she d told me,faulkner

34771,34772,and there i wa without ani hat look like i wa crazi too,like a man would natur think one of them is crazi and anoth one drown himself and the other one wa turn out into the street by her husband what s the reason the rest of them are not crazi too,faulkner
34773,34774,all the time i could see them watch me like a hawk wait for a chanc to say well i m not surpris i expect it all the time the whole famili s crazi,sell land to send him to harvard and pay tax to support a state univers all the time that i never saw except twice at a basebal game and not let her daughter s name be spoken on the place until after a while father would nt even come down town anymor but just sat there all day with the decant i could see the bottom of hi nightshirt and hi bare leg and hear the decant clink until final tp,faulkner

34777,34778,saw me come and dodg into anoth alley run up and down the alley with a dam show man in a red tie that everybodi would look at and think what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie,well the boy kept speak to me and so i took the telegram without know i had taken it,faulkner
34779,34780,i did nt realis what it wa until i wa sign for it and i tore it open without even care much what it wa,i knew all the time what it would be i reckon,faulkner
34781,34782,that wa the onli thing els that could happen especi hold it up until i had alreadi had the check enter on the pass book,i dont see how a citi no bigger than new york can hold enough peopl to take the money away from us countri sucker,faulkner

35113,35114,mayb they d have enough music to entertain them while they drove fourteen or fifteen mile home and unhar in the dark and fed the stock and milk,all they d have to do would be to whistl the music and tell the joke to the live stock in the barn and then they could count up how much they d made by not take the stock to the show too,faulkner
35115,35116,they could figur that if a man had five children and seven mule he clear a quarter by take hi famili to the show,just like that,faulkner

35131,35132,they are as big a nuisanc as the pigeon to my notion,you cant even sit in the courthous yard for them,faulkner
35133,35134,first thing you know bing,right on your hat,faulkner
35135,35136,but it would take a millionair to afford to shoot them at five cent a shot,if they d just put a littl poison out there in the squar they d get rid of them in a day becaus if a merchant cant keep hi stock from run around the squar he d better tri to deal in someth besid chicken someth that dont eat like plow or onion,faulkner
