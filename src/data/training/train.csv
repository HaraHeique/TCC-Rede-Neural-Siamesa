1931,1932,push me up versh,your paw told you to stay out that tree,faulkner
1933,1934,versh said,that was a long time ago,faulkner

1937,1938,besides he said to mind me tonight,did not he did not he say to mind me tonight,faulkner

1947,1948,versh said,you the one going to get whipped,faulkner
1949,1950,i aint,he went and pushed caddy up into the tree to the first limb,faulkner
1951,1952,we watched the muddy bottom of her drawers,then we could not see her,faulkner
1953,1954,we could hear the tree thrashing,mr jason said if you break that tree he whip you,faulkner
1955,1956,versh said,i am going to tell on her too,faulkner
1957,1958,jason said,the tree quit thrashing,faulkner
1959,1960,we looked up into the still branches,what you seeing,faulkner
1961,1962,frony whispered,i saw them,faulkner
1963,1964,then i saw caddy with flowers in her hair and a long veil like shining wind,caddy caddy hush,faulkner
1965,1966,t,p,faulkner

1977,1978,he said,hush,faulkner
1979,1980,come on here quick,he pulled me on,faulkner

1985,1986,we can say dan drank it,mr quentin always saying he so smart we can say he sassprilluh dog too,faulkner
1987,1988,the moonlight came down the cellar stairs,we drank some more sassprilluh,faulkner
1989,1990,you know what i wish,t,faulkner
1991,1992,p,said,faulkner
1993,1994,i wish a bear would walk in that cellar door,you know what i do,faulkner
1995,1996,i walk right up to him and spit in he eye,gimme that bottle to stop my mouth before i holler,faulkner
1997,1998,t,p,faulkner
1999,2000,fell down,he began to laugh and the cellar door and the moonlight jumped away and something hit me,faulkner
2001,2002,he had lost his magic,the impulse was spent,routh
2003,2004,he had never failed in the theater everything he had done had been strong and successful and then the terrible thing happened he could not act,going onstage became agony,routh
2005,2006,instead of the certainty that he was going to be wonderful he knew he was going to fail,it happened three times in a row and by the last time nobody was interested nobody came,routh
2007,2008,he could not get over to the audience,his talent was dead,routh
2009,2010,of course if you have had it you always have something unlike anyone else is,i will always be unlike anyone else axler told himself because i am who i am,routh
2011,2012,i carry that with methat people will always remember,but the aura he had had all his mannerisms and eccentricities and personal peculiarities what had worked for falstaff and peer gynt and vanyawhat had gained simon axler his reputation as the last of the best of the classical american stage actorsnone of it worked for any role now,routh
2013,2014,all that had worked to make him himself now worked to make him look like a lunatic,he was conscious of every moment he was on the stage in the worst possible way,routh
2015,2016,in the past when he was acting he was not thinking about anything,what he did well he did out of instinct,routh
2017,2018,now he was thinking about everything and everything spontaneous and vital was killedhe tried to control it with thinking and instead he destroyed it,all right axler told himself he had hit a bad period,routh
2019,2020,though he was already in his sixties maybe it would pass while he was still recognizably himself,he would not be the first experienced actor to go through it,routh
2021,2022,a lot of people did,i have done this before he thought so i will find some way,routh
2023,2024,i do not know how i am going to get it this time but i will find itthis will pass,it did not pass,routh
2025,2026,he could not act,the ways he could once rivet attention on the stage,routh
2027,2028,and now he dreaded every performance and dreaded it all day long,he spent the entire day thinking thoughts he had never thought before a performance in his life i wo not make it i wo not be able to do it i am playing the wrong roles i am overreaching i am faking i have no idea even of how to do the first line,routh
2029,2030,and meanwhile he tried to occupy the hours doing a hundred seemingly necessary things to prepare i have to look at this speech again i have to rest i have to exercise i have to look at that speech again and by the time he got to the theater he was exhausted,and dreading going out there,routh
2031,2032,he would hear the cue coming closer and closer and know that he could not do it,he waited for the freedom to begin and the moment to become real he waited to forget who he was and to become the person doing it but instead he was standing there completely empty doing the kind of acting you do when you do not know what you are doing,routh
2033,2034,he could not give and he could not withhold he had no fluidity and he had no reserve,acting became a nightafternight exercise in trying to get away with something,routh
2035,2036,it had started with people speaking to him,he could not have been more than three or four when he was already mesmerized by speaking and being spoken to,routh
2037,2038,he had felt he was in a play from the outset,he could use intensity of listening concentration as lesser actors used fireworks,routh
2039,2040,he had that power offstage too particularly when younger with women who did not realize that they had a story until he revealed to them that they had a story a voice and a style belonging to no other,they became actresses with axler they became the heroines of their own lives,routh
2041,2042,few stage actors could speak and be spoken to the way he could yet he could do neither anymore,the sound that used to go into his ear felt as though it were going out and every word he uttered seemed acted instead of spoken,routh
2043,2044,the initial source in his acting was in what he heard his response to what he heard was at the core of it and if he could not listen could not hear he had nothing to go on,he was asked to play prospero and macbeth at the kennedy centerit was hard to think of a more ambitious double billand he failed appallingly in both but especially as macbeth,routh
2045,2046,he could not do lowintensity shakespeare and he could not do highintensity shakespeareand he had been doing shakespeare all his life,his macbeth was ludicrous and everyone who saw it said as much and so did many who had not seen it,routh
2047,2048,no they do not even have to have been there he said to insult you,a lot of actors would have turned to drink to help themselves out an old joke had it that there was an actor who would always drink before he went onstage and when he was warned you must not drink he replied what and go out there alone,routh
2049,2050,but axler did not drink and so he collapsed instead,his breakdown was colossal,routh
2051,2052,the worst of it was that he saw through his breakdown the same way he could see through his acting,the suffering was excruciating and yet he doubted that it was genuine which made it even worse,routh
2053,2054,he did not know how he was going to get from one minute to the next his mind felt as though it were melting he was terrified to be alone he could not sleep more than two or three hours a night he scarcely ate he thought every day of killing himself with the gun in the attica remington 870 pumpaction shotgun that he kept in the isolated farmhouse for selfdefenseand still the whole thing seemed to be an act a bad act,when you are playing the role of somebody coming apart it has organization and order when you are observing yourself coming apart playing the role of your own demise that is something else something awash with terror and fear,routh
2055,2056,he could not convince himself he was mad any more than he had been able to convince himself or anyone else he was prospero or macbeth,he was an artificial madman too,routh
2057,2058,the only role available to him was the role of someone playing a role,a sane man playing an insane man,routh
2059,2060,a stable man playing a broken man,a selfcontrolled man playing a man out of control,routh
2061,2062,a man of solid achievement of theatrical renowna large burly actor standing six feet four inches tall with a big bald head and the strong hairy body of a brawler with a face that could convey so much a decisive jaw and stern dark eyes and a sizable mouth he could twist every which way and a low commanding voice emanating from deep down that always had a little growl in it a man conscientiously on the grand scale who looked as if he could stand up to anything and easily fulfill all of a man is roles the embodiment of invulnerable resistance who looked to have absorbed into his being the egoism of a dependable giantplaying an insignificant mite,he screamed aloud when he awakened in the night and found himself still locked inside the role of the man deprived of himself his talent and his place in the world a loathsome man who was nothing more than the inventory of his defects,routh
2063,2064,in the mornings he hid in bed for hours but instead of hiding from the role he was merely playing the role,and when finally he got up all he could think about was suicide and not its simulation either,routh
2065,2066,a man who wanted to live playing a man who wanted to die,meanwhile prospero is most famous words would not let him be perhaps because he had so recently mangled them,routh
2067,2068,they repeated themselves so regularly in his head that they soon became a hubbub of sounds tortuously empty of meaning and pointing at no reality yet carrying the force of a spell full of personal significance,our revels now are ended,routh
2069,2070,these our actors  as i foretold you were all spirits and  are melted into air into thin air,he could do nothing to blot out thin air the two syllables that were chaotically repeated while he lay powerless in his bed in the morning and that had the aura of an obscure indictment even as they came to make less and less sense,routh
2071,2072,his whole intricate personality was entirely at the mercy of thin air,victoria axler is wife could no longer care for him and by now needed tending herself,routh
2073,2074,she would cry whenever she saw him at the kitchen table his head in his hands unable to eat the meal she had prepared,try something she begged but he ate nothing said nothing and soon victoria began to panic,routh
2075,2076,she had never seen him give way like this before not even eight years earlier when his elderly parents had died in an automobile crash with his father at the wheel,he wept then and he went on,routh
2077,2078,he always went on,he took the losses hard but the performance never faltered,routh
2079,2080,and when victoria was in turmoil it was he who kept her tough and got her through,there was always a drug drama with her errant son,routh
2081,2082,there was the permanent hardship of aging and the end of her career,so much disappointment but he was there and so she could bear it,routh
2083,2084,if only he were here now that the man on whom she had depended was gone,in the 1950s victoria powers had been balanchine is youngest favorite,routh
2085,2086,then she hurt her knee had an operation danced again hurt it again had another operation and by the time she was rehabilitated the second time round someone else was balanchine is youngest favorite,she never recovered her place,routh
2087,2088,there was a marriage the son a divorce a second marriage a second divorce and then she met and fell in love with simon axler who when he had first come from college two decades earlier to make a career on the new york stage used to go to the city center to see her dance not because he loved ballet but because of his youthful susceptibility to the capacity she had to stir him to lust through the pathway of the tenderest emotions she remained in his memory for years afterward as the very incarnation of erotic pathos,when they met as fortyyearolds in the late seventies it was a long time since anyone had asked her to perform though pluckily she went off every day to her workout at a local dance studio,routh
2089,2090,she had done all she could to keep herself fit and looking youthful but by then her pathos exceeded any ability she had ever had to master it artistically,after the kennedy center debacle and his unexpected collapse victoria fell apart and fled to california to be close to her son,routh
2091,2092,all at once axler was alone in the house in the country and terrified of killing himself,now there was nothing stopping him,routh
2093,2094,now he could go ahead and do what he had found himself unable to do while she was still there walk up the stairs to the attic load the gun put the barrel in his mouth and reach down with his long arms to pull the trigger,the gun as the sequel to the wife,routh
2095,2096,but once she had left he did not make it through the first hour alonedid not even go up the first flight of stairs toward the atticbefore he had phoned his doctor and asked him to arrange for his admission to a psychiatric hospital that very day,within only minutes the doctor had found him a place at hammerton a small hospital with a good reputation a few hours to the north,routh
2097,2098,he was there for twentysix days,once interviewed unpacked relieved of his sharps by a nurse and his valuables taken to the business office for safekeeping once alone and in the room assigned him he sat down on the bed and remembered role after role that he had played with absolute assurance since he had become a professional in his early twentieswhat had destroyed his confidence now,routh
2099,2100,what was he doing in this hospital room,a selftravesty had come into being who did not exist before a selftravesty grounded in nothing and he was that selftravesty and how had it happened,routh
2101,2102,was it purely the passage of time bringing on decay and collapse,was it a manifestation of aging,routh
2103,2104,his appearance was still impressive,his aims as an actor had not changed nor had his painstaking manner of preparation for a role,routh
2105,2106,there was no one more thorough and studious and serious no one who took better care of his talent or who better accommodated himself to the changing conditions of a career in the theater over so many decades,to cease so precipitously being the actor he wasit was inexplicable as though he had been disarmed of the weight and substance of his professional existence one night while he slept,routh
2107,2108,the ability to speak and be spoken to on a stagethat is what it came down to and that is what was gone,the psychiatrist he saw dr,routh
2109,2110,farr questioned whether what had befallen him could truly be causeless and in their twiceweekly sessions asked him to examine the circumstances of his life preceding the sudden onset of what the doctor described as a universal nightmare,by this he meant that the actor is misfortune in the theatergoing out on the stage and finding himself unable to perform the shock of that losswas the content of troubling dreams any number of people had about themselves people who unlike simon axler were not professional actors,routh
2111,2112,going out on the stage and being unable to perform was among the stock set of dreams that most every patient reported at one time or another,that and walking naked down a busy city street or being unprepared for a crucial exam or falling off a cliff or finding on the highway that your brakes do not work,routh
2113,2114,dr,farr asked axler to talk about his marriage about his parents death about his relations with his drugaddicted stepson his boyhood his adolescence his beginnings as an actor an older sister who had died of lupus when he was twenty,routh
2115,2116,the doctor wanted to hear in particular detail about the weeks and months leading up to his appearance at the kennedy center and to know if he remembered anything out of the ordinary large or small occurring during that period,axler worked hard to be truthful and thereby to reveal the origins of his conditionand with that to recover his powersbut as far as he could tell no cause for the universal nightmare presented itself in anything he said sitting across from the sympathetic and attentive psychiatrist,routh
2117,2118,and that made it all the more a nightmare,yet he talked to the doctor anyway each time he showed up,routh
2119,2120,why not,at a certain stage of misery you will try anything to explain what is going on with you even if you know it does not explain a thing and it is one failed explanation after another,routh
2121,2122,some twenty days into his stay at the hospital a night came when instead of waking at two or three and lying sleepless in the midst of his terror till dawn he slept right through until eight in the morning so late by hospital standards that a nurse had to come to his room to awaken him so that he could join the other patients for 745 breakfast in the dining hall and then begin the day which included group therapy art therapy a consultation with dr,farr and a session with the physical therapist who was doing her best to treat his perennial spinal pain,routh
2123,2124,every waking hour was filled with activities and appointments to prevent the patients from retiring to their rooms to lie depressed and miserable on their beds or to sit around with one another as a number of them did in the evenings anyway discussing the ways they had tried to kill themselves,several times he sat in the corner of the rec room with the small gang of suicidal patients and listened to them recalling the ardor with which they had planned to die and bemoaning how they had failed,routh
2125,2126,each of them remained immersed in the magnitude of his or her suicide attempt and the ignominy of having survived it,that people could really do it that they could control their own death was a source of fascination to them allit was their natural subject like boys talking about sports,routh
2127,2128,several described feeling something akin to the rush that a psychopath must get when he kills someone else sweeping over them when they attempted to kill themselves,a young woman said you seem to yourself and to everyone around you paralyzed and wholly ineffectual and yet you can decide to commit the most difficult act there is,routh
2129,2130,it is exhilarating,it is invigorating,routh
2131,2132,it is euphoric,yes said someone else there is a grim euphoria to it,routh
2133,2134,your life is falling apart it has no center and suicide is the one thing you can control,one elderly man a retired schoolteacher who had tried to hang himself in his garage gave them a lecture on the ways outsiders think about suicide,routh
2135,2136,the one thing that everyone wants to do with suicide is explain it,explain it and judge it,routh
2137,2138,it is so appalling for the people that are left behind that there has to be a way of thinking about it,some people think of it as an act of cowardice,routh
2139,2140,some people think of it as criminal as a crime against the survivors,another school of thought finds it heroic and an act of courage,routh
2141,2142,then there are the purists,the question for them is was it justified was there sufficient cause,routh
2143,2144,the more clinical point of view which is neither punitive nor idealizing is the psychologist is which attempts to describe the state of mind of the suicide what state of mind he was in when he did it,he went tediously on in this vein more or less every night as though he were not an anguished patient like the rest of them but a guest lecturer who had been brought in to elucidate the subject that obsessed them night and day,routh
2145,2146,one evening axler spoke upto perform he realized before his largest audience since he had given up acting,suicide is the role you write for yourself he told them,routh
2147,2148,you inhabit it and you enact it,all carefully stagedwhere they will find you and how they will find you,routh
2149,2150,then he added but one performance only,in their conversation everything private was revealed easily and shamelessly suicide seemed like a very huge aim and living a hateful condition,routh
2151,2152,among the patients he met there were some who knew him right off because of his handful of movies but they were too immersed in their own struggles to take much more notice of him than they did of anyone other than themselves,and the staff was too busy to be distracted for long by his theatrical renown,routh
2153,2154,he was all but unrecognizable in the hospital not only to others but to himself,from the moment that he had rediscovered the miracle of a night is sleep and had to be awakened for breakfast by the nurse he began to feel the dread subside,routh
2155,2156,they had given him one medication for depression that did not agree with him then a second and finally a third that caused no intolerable side effects but whether it did him any good he could not tell,he could not believe that his improvement had anything to do with pills or with psychiatric consultations or group therapy or art therapy all of which felt like empty exercises,routh
2157,2158,what continued to frighten him as the day of his discharge approached was that nothing that was happening to him seemed to have to do with anything else,as he had told dr,routh
2159,2160,farrand further convinced himself by having tried to the best of his ability to search for a cause during their sessionshe had lost his magic as an actor for no good reason and it was just as arbitrarily that the desire to end his life began to ebb at least for the time being,nothing has a good reason for happening he said to the doctor later that day,routh
2161,2162,you lose you gainit is all caprice,the omnipotence of caprice,routh
2163,2164,the likelihood of reversal,yes the unpredictable reversal and its power,routh
2165,2166,near the end of his stay he made a friend and each night they had dinner together she repeated her story to him,he had met her first in art therapy and after that they would sit across from each other at a table for two in the dining hall chatting like a couple on a date orgiven the thirtyyear age differencelike a father and daughter albeit about her suicide attempt,routh
2167,2168,the day they meta couple of days after her arrivalthere had been only the two of them in the art room along with the therapist who as though they were kindergarteners had handed each sheets of white paper and a box of crayons to play with and told them to draw whatever they wanted,all that was missing from the room he thought were the little tables and chairs,routh
2169,2170,to satisfy the therapist they worked in silence for fifteen minutes and then again for the sake of the therapist listened attentively to the response each offered to the other is drawing,she had drawn a house and a garden and he a picture of himself drawing a picture a picture he told the therapist when she asked him what he had done of a man who has broken down and who commits himself to a psychiatric hospital and goes to art therapy and is asked there by the therapist to draw a picture,routh
2171,2172,and suppose you were to give your picture a title simon,what would it be,routh
2173,2174,that is easy,what the hell am i doing here,routh
2175,2176,the five other patients scheduled to be at art therapy either were back on their beds unable to do anything except lie there and weep or as though an emergency had befallen them had rushed off without an appointment to their doctors offices and were sitting in the waiting room preparing to lament over the wife the husband the child the boss the mother the father the boyfriend the girlfriendwhomever it was they never wanted to see again or whom they would be willing to see again so long as the doctor was present and there was no shouting or violence or threats of violence or whom they missed horribly and could not live without and whom they would do anything to get back,each of them sat waiting a turn to denounce a parent to vilify a sibling to belittle a mate to vindicate or excoriate or pity themselves,routh
2177,2178,one or two of them who could still concentrateor pretend to concentrate or strain to concentrateon something other than the misery of their grievance would while waiting for the doctor leaf through a copy of time or sports illustrated or pick up the local paper and try to do the crossword puzzle,everybody else would be sitting there gloomily silent inwardly intense and rehearsing to themselvesin the lexicon of pop psychology or gutter obscenity or christian suffering or paranoid pathologythe ancient themes of dramatic literature incest betrayal injustice cruelty vengeance jealousy rivalry desire loss dishonor and grief,routh
2179,2180,she was an elfin paleskinned brunette with the bony frailty of a sickly girl of about a quarter her age,her name was sybil van buren,routh
2181,2182,in the eyes of the actor hers was a thirtyfiveyearold body that not only refused to be strong but dreaded even the appearance of strength,and yet for all her delicacy she had said to him on the way up the path to the main residence hall from art therapy will you eat dinner with me simon,routh
2183,2184,amazing,still some kind of wish in her not to be swallowed up,routh
2185,2186,or maybe she had asked to stay on at his side in the hope that with a little luck something would ignite between them that would complete the doing in of her,he was big enough for the job more than whale enough for a tiny bundle of flotsam like her,routh
2187,2188,even herewhere without assistance from the pharmacopoeia any show of stability let alone bravado was unlikely to quell for long the maelstrom of terror swirling back of the gullethe had not lost the loose swaggering gait of the ominous man that had once gone toward making him such an original othello,and so yes if there was still any hope for her of going completely under perhaps it lay in cozying up to him,routh
2189,2190,that is what he thought at the outset anyway,i had lived for so long in the constraints of caution sybil told him at dinner that first night,routh
2191,2192,the efficient housewife who gardens and sews and can repair everything and throws glorious dinner parties as well,the quiet steady loyal sidekick of the rich and powerful man with her unambiguous wholehearted oldfashioned devotion to the rearing of children,routh
2193,2194,the ordinary existence of an insignificant mortal,well i went off to go shopping for grocerieswhat could be more mundane than that,routh
2195,2196,why would anyone in the world have to worry about that,i had left my daughter playing out back in the yard and our little boy upstairs sleeping in his crib and my rich and powerful second husband watching a golf tournament on tv,routh
2197,2198,i turned around and came home because when i got to the supermarket i realized i had forgotten my wallet,the little one was still sleeping,routh
2199,2200,and in the living room the golf game was still going but my eightyearold daughter my little alison was sitting up on the sofa without her underpants and my rich and powerful second husband was kneeling on the floor his head between her plump little legs,what was he doing there,routh
2201,2202,what men do there,axler watched her cry and said nothing,routh
2203,2204,you have seen my artwork she finally told him,the sun shining down on a pretty house and the garden all in bloom,routh
2205,2206,you know me,everybody knows me,routh
2207,2208,i think the best of everything,i prefer it that way and so does everyone around me,routh
2209,2210,he got up off his knees completely unruffled and told me that she had been complaining about an itch and she would not stop scratching herself and so before she did herself any harm he had taken a look to be sure she was all right,and she was he assured me,routh
2211,2212,he could see nothing not a blemish not a sore not a rash,she was fine,routh
2213,2214,good i said,i came back for my wallet,routh
2215,2216,and instead of getting his hunting rifle from the basement and pumping him full of bullets i found my wallet in the kitchen said bye again everyone and went off to the store as if what i had witnessed was a commonplace occurrence,in a daze dumbfounded i filled two shopping carts,routh
2217,2218,i would have filled two more four more six more if the store manager had not seen me blubbering away and come over to ask if i was all right,he drove me home in his car,routh
2219,2220,i left our car in the lot there and was driven home,i could not negotiate the stairs,routh
2221,2222,i had to be carried up to bed,there i lay for four days unable to speak or eat barely able to drag myself to the bathroom,routh
2223,2224,the story was that i had come down with a fever and been ordered to bed,my rich and powerful second husband could not have been more solicitous,routh
2225,2226,my little darling alison sweetly brought me a vase of cut flowers from my garden,i could not ask her i could not bring myself to say who removed your underpants,routh
2227,2228,what do you want to tell me,if you really had some kind of itch you would have waited would not you until i came home from shopping to show me,routh
2229,2230,but dear if you did not have an itch,dear if there is something you are not telling me because you are afraid to,routh
2231,2232,,,routh
2233,2234,,but i was the one who was afraid,routh
2235,2236,i could not do it,by the fourth day i had convinced myself that i had imagined everything and two weeks later when alison was at school and he was at work and the little one was taking his nap i got out the wine and the valium and the plastic garbage bag,routh
2237,2238,but i could not stand suffocating,i panicked,routh
2239,2240,i took the pills and the wine but then i remember not getting any air and hurrying to rip the bag off,and i do not know what i regret more horriblyhaving tried to do it or having failed to do it,routh
2241,2242,all i want to do is shoot him,only now he is alone with them and i am here,routh
2243,2244,he is all alone with my sweet little girl,it ca not be,routh
2245,2246,i called my sister and asked her to stay at the house with them but he would not let her sleep there,he said there was no need,routh
2247,2248,and so she left,and what can i do,routh
2249,2250,i am here and alison is there,i was paralyzed,routh
2251,2252,i did nothing that i should have done,nothing that anyone would have done,routh
2253,2254,i should have rushed the child to the doctor,i should have called the police,routh
2255,2256,it was a criminal act,there are laws against such things,routh
2257,2258,instead i did nothing,but he said nothing had happened you see,routh
2259,2260,he says that i am hysterical that i am deluded that i am mad but i am not,i swear to you simon i am not mad,routh
2261,2262,i saw him doing it,that is horrible,routh
2263,2264,a horrible transgression axler said,i see why it is done what it did to you,routh
2265,2266,it is evil,i need someone she confided in a murmur to kill this evil man,routh
2267,2268,i am sure you could find a willing party,you,routh
2269,2270,asked sybil in a tiny voice,i had pay,routh
2271,2272,if i was a killer i would do it pro bono he said taking the hand she extended to him,people become infected with the rage when an innocent child is violated,routh
2273,2274,but i am an outofwork actor,i had botch the job and we had both go to jail,routh
2275,2276,oh what should i do,she asked him,routh
2277,2278,what would you do,get strong,routh
2279,2280,cooperate with the doctor and try to get strong as fast as you can so you can go home to your children,you believe me do not you,routh
2281,2282,i am sure you saw what you saw,can we have dinner together,routh
2283,2284,for as long as i am here he said,i knew in art therapy that you had understand,routh
2285,2286,there is so much suffering in your eyes,within months of his leaving the hospital his wife is son died of an overdose and the marriage of the occupationless dancer to the occupationless actor ended in divorce completing yet one more of the many millions of stories of unhappily entwined men and women,routh
2287,2288,one day around noon a black town car pulled into the driveway and parked beside the barn,it was a chauffeurdriven mercedes and the small whitehaired man who stepped out of the back seat was jerry oppenheim his agent,routh
2289,2290,after the hospital internment jerry had phoned him every week from new york to see how he was doing but many months had gone by without their speakingthe actor having chosen at one point to stop taking the agent is calls along with most everyone else isand the visit was unexpected,he watched jerry who was over eighty and walked cautiously negotiate the stone path to the front door a package in one hand and flowers in the other,routh
2291,2292,he opened the door before jerry even had a chance to knock,suppose i had not been home,routh
2293,2294,he said helping jerry over the sill,i took my chances jerry said smiling gently,routh
2295,2296,he had a gentle face altogether and a courteous demeanor that did not however compromise his tenacity in behalf of his clients,well you seem all right physically at least,routh
2297,2298,except for that hopeless look on your face simon you do not look bad at all,and youneat as a pin axler said having himself neither changed his clothes nor shaved for days,routh
2299,2300,i brought you flowers,i brought us a box lunch from dean and deluca,routh
2301,2302,have you had lunch,he had not even had breakfast so he merely shrugged and took the gifts and helped jerry out of his coat,routh
2303,2304,you drove up from new york he said,yes,routh
2305,2306,to see how you are doing and talk to you facetoface,i have news for you,routh
2307,2308,the guthrie is doing long day is journey,they called to ask about you,routh
2309,2310,why me,i ca not act jerry and everyone knows it,routh
2311,2312,nobody knows any such thing,perhaps people know that you had an emotional setback but that does not set you apart from the human race,routh
2313,2314,they are doing the play next winter,it gets awfully cold out there but you had be a wonderful james tyrone,routh
2315,2316,james tyrone is a lot of lines that you have to say and i ca not say them,james tyrone is a character that you have to be and i ca not be him,routh
2317,2318,there is no way i can play james tyrone,i ca not play anyone,routh
2319,2320,look you took a tumble in washington,that happens to practically everyone sooner or later,routh
2321,2322,there is no ironclad security in any art,people run into an obstacle for reasons no one knows,routh
2323,2324,but the obstacle is a temporary impediment,the obstacle disappears and you go on,routh
2325,2326,there is not a firstrate actor who has not felt discouraged and that his career was over and that he was unable to come out of the bad period he was in,there is not an actor who has not gone up in the middle of a speech and not known where he was,routh
2327,2328,but every time you go out on the stage there is a new chance,actors can recover their talent,routh
2329,2330,you do not lose the skills if you have been out there for forty years,you still know how to enter and sit down in a chair,routh
2331,2332,john gielgud used to say that there were times he wished he were like a painter or a writer,then he could retrieve the bad performance he gave that evening and take it out at midnight and redo it,routh
2333,2334,but he could not,he had to do it there,routh
2335,2336,gielgud went through a very bad time when he could do nothing right,so did olivier,routh
2337,2338,olivier went through a terrible period,he had a terrible problem,routh
2339,2340,he could not look any of the other actors in the eye,he told the other actors please do not look at me because it will throw me,routh
2341,2342,for a while he could not be alone on the stage,he said to the other actors  hado not leave me alone out there,routh
2343,2344,i know the stories jerry,i have heard them all,routh
2345,2346,they do not have to do with me,in the past i never had more than two or three bad nights when i could not recover,routh
2347,2348,for two or three nights i would think i know i am good i am just not doing it,maybe nobody in the audience knew it but i knew itit was not there,routh
2349,2350,and on those nights when it is not there for you it is a labor i know that and yet somehow you get by,you can get very good at getting by on what you get by on when you do not have anything else,routh
2351,2352,but that is something different entirely,when i had a truly wretched performance i would lie awake all night afterward thinking i have lost it i have no talent i ca not do anything,routh
2353,2354,hours would go by but then all of a sudden at five or six in the morning i had understand what went wrong and i could not wait to get to the theater that evening and go on,and i had go on and i could not make a mistake,routh
2355,2356,a beautiful feeling,there are days when you ca not wait to get there when the marriage between you and the role is perfect and there is never a time when you are not happy to sail out onto the stage,routh
2357,2358,those are important days,and for years i had them one after the other,routh
2359,2360,well that is over,now if i were to go out on the stage i would not know what i was out there for,routh
2361,2362,would not know where to begin,in the old days i had do three hours of preparation in the theater for an eight oclock curtain,routh
2363,2364,by eight i was deeply inside that roleit was like a trance like a useful trance,in the family reunion i was in the theater two and a half hours before the first entrance working up to how to enter when you are pursued by the furies,routh
2365,2366,that was hard for me but i did it,you can do it again jerry said,routh
2367,2368,you are forgetting who you are and what you have achieved,your life has hardly come to nothing,routh
2369,2370,endlessly you would do things on the stage in a way i never expected and over the years that was thrilling thousands of times for the audience and always thrilling for me,you went as far away as possible from the obvious thing that any other actor would do,routh
2371,2372,you could not be routine,you wanted to go everywhere,routh
2373,2374,out out out as far out as you could go,and the audience believed in you in every moment wherever you took them,routh
2375,2376,sure nothing is permanently established but so is nothing permanently lost,your talent is been mislaid that is all,routh
2377,2378,no it is gone jerry,i ca not do any of it again,routh
2379,2380,you are either free or you are not,you are either free and it is genuine it is real it is alive or it is nothing,routh
2381,2382,i am not free anymore,okay let is have some lunch then,routh
2383,2384,and put the flowers in some water,the house looks fine,routh
2385,2386,you look fine,a little too slimmed down i would say but you still look like yourself,routh
2387,2388,you are eating i hope,i eat,routh
2389,2390,but when they sat down to lunch in the kitchen with the flowers in a vase between them axler was unable to eat,he saw himself stepping out on the stage to play james tyrone and the audience bursting into laughter,routh
2391,2392,the anxiety and fear were as naked as that,people would laugh at him because it was him,routh
2393,2394,what do you do with the days,jerry asked,routh
2395,2396,walk,sleep,routh
2397,2398,stare into space,try to read,routh
2399,2400,try to forget myself for at least one minute of each hour,i watch the news,routh
2401,2402,i am up to date on the news,who do you see,routh
2403,2404,you,this is no way for someone of your accomplishment to live,routh
2405,2406,you were kind to come all the way out here jerry but i ca not do the play at the guthrie,i am finished with all that,routh
2407,2408,you are not,you are scared of failing,routh
2409,2410,but that is behind you,you do not realize how onesided and monomaniacal your perspective has become,routh
2411,2412,did i write the reviews,did this monomaniac write those reviews,routh
2413,2414,did i write what they wrote about my macbeth,i was ludicrous and they said as much,routh
2415,2416,i would just think i got through that line thank god i got through that line,i would try to think that was not as bad as last night when in fact it was worse,routh
2417,2418,everything i did was false raucous,i heard this horrible tone in my voice and yet nothing could stop me from fucking up,routh
2419,2420,hideous,hideous,routh
2421,2422,i never gave a good performance not one,so you could not do macbeth to your satisfaction,routh
2423,2424,well you are not the first,he is a horrible person for an actor to live with,routh
2425,2426,i defy anyone to play him and not be warped by the effort,he is a murderer he is a killer,routh
2427,2428,everything is magnified in that play,frankly i never understood all that evil,routh
2429,2430,forget macbeth,forget those reviews jerry said,routh
2431,2432,it is time to move on,you should come down to new york and begin to work in his studio with vincent daniels,routh
2433,2434,you wo not be the first whose confidence he is restored,look you have done all that tough stuff shakespeare the classicsthere is no way this can happen to you with your biography,routh
2435,2436,it is a momentary loss of confidence,it is not a matter of confidence replied axler,routh
2437,2438,i always had a sneaking suspicion that i have no talent whatsoever,well that is nonsense,routh
2439,2440,that is the depression talking,you hear actors saying it a lot when they are down the way you are,routh
2441,2442,i do not have any real talent,i can memorize the lines,routh
2443,2444,that is about it,i have heard it a thousand times,routh
2445,2446,no listen to me,when i was fully honest with myself i had think okay all right i have a modicum of talent or i can at least imitate a talented person,routh
2447,2448,but it was all a fluke jerry a fluke that a talent was given to me a fluke that it was taken away,this life is a fluke from start to finish,routh
2449,2450,oh stop this simon,you can still hold attention the way a big star actor does on the stage,routh
2451,2452,you are a titan for god is sake,no it is a matter of falseness sheer falseness so pervasive that all i can do is stand on the stage and tell the audience i am a liar,routh
2453,2454,and i ca not even lie well,i am a fraud,routh
2455,2456,and that is more nonsense,think for a moment of all the bad actorsthere are lots of them and they somehow get by,routh
2457,2458,so to tell me that simon axler jerry said with his talent ca not get by is absurd,i have seen you in the past times when you were not so happy times when you were in psychic torment in every other way but put a script in front of you allow you to access this thing that you do so wonderfully allow you to become another person and always it is been liberating for you,routh
2459,2460,well that is happened before and it can happen again,the love of what you do wellit can return and it will return,routh
2461,2462,look vincent daniels is an ace at dealing with problems like yours a tough canny intuitive teacher highly intelligent and a scrapper himself,i know his name he told jerry,routh
2463,2464,but i have never met him,i never had to meet him,routh
2465,2466,he is a maverick he is a scrapper and he will get you back to contending,he will put the fight back in you,routh
2467,2468,he will start from scratch if he has to,he will get you to give up everything you have done before if he must,routh
2469,2470,it will be a struggle but in the end he will get you back to where you should be,i have been to his studio and watched vincent work,routh
2471,2472,he says  hado one moment,we are only dealing with the single moment,routh
2473,2474,play the moment play whatever plays for you in that moment and then go on to the next moment,it does not matter where you are going,routh
2475,2476,do not worry about that,just take it moment moment moment moment,routh
2477,2478,the job is to be in that moment with no concern about the rest and no idea where you are going next,because if you can make one moment work you can go anywhere,routh
2479,2480,now it sounds i know like the simplest notion and that is why it is hardit is so simple that it is the thing that everybody misses,i believe that vincent daniels is the perfect man for you right now,routh
2481,2482,i have complete faith in him for you in your predicament,here is his card,routh
2483,2484,i came up here to give you this,jerry handed him the business card and so he took it at the same time that he said ca not do it,routh
2485,2486,what will you do instead,what will you do about all the roles you are ripe to play,routh
2487,2488,it breaks my heart when i think of all those parts you were made for,if you accepted the role of james tyrone then you could work with vincent and find your way through it with him,routh
2489,2490,this is the work he does with actors every day,i ca not count the number of times at the tonys or the oscars that i heard the winning actor say i want to thank vincent daniels,routh
2491,2492,he is the best,in response axler simply shook his head,routh
2493,2494,look jerry said everyone knows the feeling i ca not do it everyone knows the feeling that they will be revealed to be falseit is every actor is terror,they have found me out,routh
2495,2496,i have been found out,let is face it there is a panic that comes with age,routh
2497,2498,i am that much older than you and i have been dealing with it for years,one you get slower,routh
2499,2500,in everything,even in reading you get slower,routh
2501,2502,if i go fast in reading now too much of it goes away,my speech is slower my memory is slower,routh
2503,2504,all these things start to happen,in the process you start to distrust yourself,routh
2505,2506,you are not as quick as you used to be,and especially if you are an actor,routh
2507,2508,you were a young actor and you memorized scripts one after the other after the other and you never even thought about it,it was just easy to do,routh
2509,2510,and then all of a sudden it is not as easy and things do not happen so fast anymore,memorizing becomes a big anxiety for stage actors going into their sixties and seventies,routh
2511,2512,once you could memorize a script in a daynow you are lucky to memorize a page in a day,so you start to feel afraid to feel soft to feel that you do not have that raw live power anymore,routh
2513,2514,it scares you,with the result as you say that you are not free anymore,routh
2515,2516,there is nothing happeningand that is terrifying,jerry i ca not go on with this conversation,routh
2517,2518,we could talk all day and to no avail,you are good to come and see me and bring me lunch and flowers and to try to help me and encourage me and comfort me and make me feel better,routh
2519,2520,it was tremendously thoughtful,i am pleased to see you looking well,routh
2521,2522,but the momentum of a life is the momentum of a life,i am now incapable of acting,routh
2523,2524,something fundamental has vanished,maybe it had to,routh
2525,2526,things go,do not think that my career is been cut short,routh
2527,2528,think of how long i lasted,when i started out in college i was just fooling around you know,routh
2529,2530,acting was a chance to meet girls,then i took my first theatrical breath,routh
2531,2532,suddenly i was alive on the stage and breathing like an actor,i started young,routh
2533,2534,i was twentytwo and came to new york for an audition,and i got the part,routh
2535,2536,i began to take classes,sensememory exercises,routh
2537,2538,practice making things real,before your performance create a reality for yourself to step into,routh
2539,2540,i remember that when i began taking class we had have a pretend teacup and pretend to drink from it,how hot is it how full is it is there a saucer is there a spoon are you going to put sugar in it how many lumps,routh
2541,2542,and then you sip it and others were transported by this stuff but i never found any of it helpful,what is more i could not do it,routh
2543,2544,i was no good at the exercises no good at all,i had try to do this stuff and it never would work,routh
2545,2546,everything i did well was coming out of instinct and doing those exercises and knowing those things were making me look like an actor,i would look ridiculous as i held my pretend teacup and pretended to drink from it,routh
2547,2548,there was always a sly voice inside me saying there is no teacup,well that sly voice has now taken over,routh
2549,2550,no matter how i prepare and what i attempt to do once i am on the stage there is that sly voice all the timethere is no teacup,jerry it is over i can no longer make a play real for people,routh
2551,2552,i can no longer make a role real for myself,after jerry had left axler went into his study and found his copy of long day is journey into night,routh
2553,2554,he tried to read it but the effort was unbearable,he did not get beyond page 4he put vincent daniels is card there as a bookmark,routh
2555,2556,at the kennedy center it was as though he had never acted before and now it was as though he had never read a play beforeas though he had never read this play before,the sentences unfolded without meaning,routh
2557,2558,he could not keep straight who was speaking the lines,sitting there amid his books he tried to remember plays in which there is a character who commits suicide,routh
2559,2560,hedda in hedda gabler julie in miss julie phaedra in hippolytus jocasta in oedipus the king almost everyone in antigone willy loman in death of a salesman joe keller in all my sons don parritt in the iceman cometh simon stimson in our town ophelia in hamlet othello in othello cassius and brutus in julius caesar goneril in king lear antony cleopatra enobarbus and charmian in antony and cleopatra the grandfather in awake and sing,ivanov in ivanov konstantin in the seagull,routh
2561,2562,and this astonishing list was only of plays in which he had at one time performed,there were more many more,routh
2563,2564,what was remarkable was the frequency with which suicide enters into drama as though it were a formula fundamental to the drama not necessarily supported by the action as dictated by the workings of the genre itself,deirdre in deirdre of the sorrows hedvig in the wild duck rebecca west in rosmersholm christine and orin in mourning becomes electra both romeo and juliet sophocles ajax,routh
2565,2566,suicide is a subject dramatists have been contemplating with awe since the fifth century b,c,routh
2567,2568,beguiled by the human beings who are capable of generating emotions that can inspire this most extraordinary act,he should set himself the task of rereading these plays,routh
2569,2570,yes everything gruesome must be squarely faced,nobody should be able to say that he did not think it through,routh
2571,2572,jerry had brought a manila envelope containing a handful of mail addressed to him in care of the oppenheim agency,there was a time when a dozen letters from fans would come to him that way every couple of weeks,routh
2573,2574,now these few were all that had arrived at jerry is during the past half year,he sat in the living room idly tearing the envelopes open reading each letter is first few lines and then balling the page up and throwing it onto the floor,routh
2575,2576,they were all requests for autographed photosall but one which took him by surprise and which he read in its entirety,i do not know if you will remember me the letter began,routh
2577,2578,i was a patient at hammerton,i had dinner with you several times,routh
2579,2580,we were in art therapy together,maybe you wo not remember me,routh
2581,2582,i have just finished watching a latenight movie on tv and to my amazement you were in it,you were playing a hardened criminal,routh
2583,2584,it was so startling to see you on the screen especially in such a menacing role,how different from the man i met,routh
2585,2586,i remember telling you my story,i remember how you listened to me meal after meal,routh
2587,2588,i could not stop talking,i was in agony,routh
2589,2590,i thought my life was over,i wanted it to be over,routh
2591,2592,you may not know it but your listening to my story the way you did contributed to my getting through back then,not that it is been easy,routh
2593,2594,not that it is now,not that it ever will be,routh
2595,2596,the monster i was married to has done ineradicable damage to my family,the disaster was worse than i knew when i was hospitalized,routh
2597,2598,terrible things had been going on for a long time without my knowing anything about them,tragic things involving my little girl,routh
2599,2600,i remember asking you if you would kill him for me,i told you i would pay,routh
2601,2602,i thought because you were so big you could do it,mercifully you did not tell me that i was crazy when i said that but sat there listening to my madness as though i were sane,routh
2603,2604,i thank you for that,but a part of me will never be sane again,routh
2605,2606,it ca not be,it could not be,routh
2607,2608,it should not be,stupidly i sentenced the wrong person to death,routh
2609,2610,the letter went on a single handwritten paragraph stretching loosely over three more big sheets of paper and it was signed sybil van buren,he remembered listening to her storysummoning up his concentration and listening like that to someone other than himself was as close as he had come to acting in a long time and may even have helped him to recover,routh
2611,2612,yes he remembered her and her story and her asking him to kill her husband as though he were a gangster in a movie rather than another patient in a psychiatric hospital who big as he was was as incapable as she of violently ending his own suffering with a gun,people go around killing people in movies all the time but the reason they make all those movies is that for 99,routh
2613,2614,9 percent of the audience it is impossible to do,and if it is that hard to kill someone else someone you have every reason to want to destroy imagine how hard it is to succeed in killing yourself,routh
2615,2616,he had known pegeens parents as good friends before pegeen was born and had seen her first in the hospital as a tiny infant nursing at her mother is breast,they had met when axler and the newly married staplefordshe from michigan she from kansasappeared together in a greenwich village church basement production of playboy of the western world,routh
2617,2618,axler had played the wonderfully wild lead role of christy mahon the wouldbe parricide while the female lead pegeen mike flaherty the strongminded barmaid in her father is pub on the west coast of county mayo had been played by carol stapleford then two months pregnant with a first child asa stapleford had played shawn keogh pegeen is betrothed,when the play is run ended axler had been at the closingnight party to cast his vote for christy as the name for a son and pegeen mike as the name for a daughter when the staplefords baby arrived,routh
2619,2620,it was not likelyparticularly as pegeen mike stapleford had lived as a lesbian since she was twentythreethat when she was forty years old and axler was sixtyfive they would become lovers who would speak on the phone every morning upon awakening and would eagerly spend their free time together at his house where to his delight she appropriated two rooms for her own one of the three bedrooms on the second floor for her things and the downstairs study off the living room for her laptop,there were fireplaces in all the downstairs rooms even one in the kitchen and when pegeen was working in the study she had a fire going all the time,routh
2621,2622,she lived a little over an hour away journeying along winding hilly roads that carried her across farm country to his fifty acres of open fields and the large old blackshuttered white farmhouse enclosed by ancient maples and big ashes and long uneven stone walls,there was nobody but the two of them anywhere nearby,routh
2623,2624,during the first few months they rarely got out of bed before noon,they could not leave each other alone,routh
2625,2626,yet before her arrival he had been sure he was finished finished with acting with women with people finished forever with happiness,he had been in serious physical distress for over a year barely able to walk any distance or to stand or sit for very long because of the spinal pain that he had put up with all his adult life but whose debilitating progress had accelerated with ageand so he was sure he was finished with everything,routh
2627,2628,one of his legs would intermittently go dead so that he could not raise it properly while walking and he would miss a step or a curb and fall opening cuts on his hands and even landing on his face bloodying his lip or his nose,only a few months earlier his best and only local friend an eightyyearold judge who had retired some years back had died of cancer as a result though axler had been based two hours from the city amid the trees and fields for thirty yearsliving there when he was not out somewhere in the world performinghe did not have anyone with whom to talk or to eat a meal let alone share a bed,routh
2629,2630,and he was thinking again about killing himself as often as he had been before being hospitalized a year earlier,every morning when he awoke to his emptiness he determined he could not go another day shorn of his skills alone workless and in persistent pain,routh
2631,2632,once again the focus was down to suicide at the center of the dispossession there was only that,on a frigid gray morning after a week of heavy snowstorms axler left the house for the carport to drive the four miles into town and stock up on groceries,routh
2633,2634,pathways around the house had been kept clear every day by a farmer who did his snowplowing for him but he walked carefully nonetheless wearing snow boots with thick treads and carrying a cane and taking tiny steps to prevent himself from slipping and falling,under his layers of clothes his midsection was enveloped for safety is sake in a stiff back brace,routh
2635,2636,as he started out of the house and headed for the carport he spotted a small longtailed whitish animal standing in the snow between the carport and the barn,it looked at first like a very large rat and then he realized from the shape and color of the furless tail and from the snout that it was a possum about ten inches long,routh
2637,2638,possums are ordinarily nocturnal but this one whose coat looked discolored and scruffy was down on the snowcovered ground in broad daylight,as axler approached the possum waddled feebly off in the direction of the barn and then disappeared into a mound of snow up against the barn is stone foundation,routh
2639,2640,he followed the animalwhich was probably sick and nearing its endand when he got to the mound of snow saw that there was an entry hole cleared at the front,supporting himself with both hands on his cane he kneeled down in the snow to peer inside,routh
2641,2642,the possum had retreated too far back into the hole to be seen but strewn about the front of the cavelike interior was a collection of sticks,he counted them,routh
2643,2644,six sticks,so that is how it is done axler thought,routh
2645,2646,i have got too much,all you need are six,routh
2647,2648,the following morning while he was making his coffee he saw the possum through the kitchen window,the animal was standing on its hind legs by the barn eating snow from a drift pushing gobs of it into its mouth with its front paws,routh
2649,2650,hurriedly he put on his boots and his coat picked up his cane went out the front door and came around to the cleared path by the side of the house facing the barn,from some twenty feet away he called across to the possum in full voice how would you like to play james tyrone,routh
2651,2652,at the guthrie,the possum just kept eating snow,routh
2653,2654,you had be a wonderful james tyrone,after that day nature is little caricature of him came to an end,routh
2655,2656,he never saw the possum againeither it disappeared or perishedthough the snow cave with the six sticks remained intact until the next thaw,then pegeen stopped by,routh
2657,2658,she phoned from the little house she had rented a few miles from prescott a small progressive women is college in western vermont where she had recently taken a teaching job,he lived an hour west across the state line in rural new york,routh
2659,2660,it was twenty years or more since he had seen her as a cheerful undergraduate traveling during her vacation with her mother and father,they had be in his vicinity and stop off for a couple of hours to say hello,routh
2661,2662,every few years they all got together like that,asa ran a regional theater in lansing michigan the town where he had been born and raised and carol acted in the repertory company and taught an acting class at the state university,routh
2663,2664,he had seen pegeen on another visit once before a smiling shy sweetfaced kid of ten who had climbed his trees and swum rapid laps in his pool a skinny athletic tomboy who laughed helplessly at all her father is jokes,and before that he had seen her suckling on the maternity floor of st,routh
2665,2666,vincent is hospital in new york,now he saw a lithe fullbreasted woman of forty though with something of the child still in her smilea smile in which she automatically raised her upper lip to reveal her prominent front teethand a lot of the tomboy still in her rocking gait,routh
2667,2668,she was dressed for the countryside in wellworn work boots and a red zippered jacket and her hair which he had incorrectly remembered as blond like her mother is was a deep brown and cut close to her skull so short at the back as to appear clipped by a barber is trimmer,she had the invulnerable air of a happy person and though her prototype was rough gamine she spoke in an appealingly modulated voice as if imitating her actress mother is diction,routh
2669,2670,as he would eventually learn it had been some time since she had had what she wanted rather than its grotesque inversion,she had spent the last two years of a sixyear affair suffering in a painfully lonely household in bozeman montana,routh
2671,2672,the first four years she told him one night after they had become lovers priscilla and i had this wonderfully cozy companionship,we used to go camping and hiking all the time even when it snowed,routh
2673,2674,in the summers we had go off to places like alaska and hike and camp up there,it was exciting,routh
2675,2676,we went to new zealand we went to malaysia,there was something childlike about us adventurously roaming around the world together that i loved,routh
2677,2678,we were like two runaways,then starting around year five she slowly drifted away into the computer and i was left with no one to talk to except the cats,routh
2679,2680,until then we had done everything side by side,we had be tucked up in bed readingreading to ourselves reading passages aloud to each other for such a long time there was the rapturous rapport,routh
2681,2682,priscilla would never tell people i liked that book but rather we liked that book or about some place we liked going there or about our plans that is what we are going to do this summer,we,routh
2683,2684,we,we,routh
2685,2686,and then we were not wewe was over,we was she and her mac,routh
2687,2688,we was she and her festering secret that blotted out everything elsethat she was going to mutilate the body i loved,the two of them taught at the university in bozeman and during their final two years as a couple when priscilla got home from work she sat in front of her computer until it was time for bed,routh
2689,2690,she spent her weekends in front of the computer,she ate and drank in front of the computer,routh
2691,2692,there was no more talk no more sex even hiking and camping in the mountains pegeen had to undertake on her own or with people other than priscilla whom she rounded up for companionship,then one day six years after they had met in montana and pooled their resources and set themselves up as a couple priscilla announced that she had begun taking hormonal injections to promote facial hair growth and deepen her voice,routh
2693,2694,her plan was to have her breasts surgically removed and become a man,alone priscilla admitted she had been dreaming this up for a long time and she would not turn back however much pegeen pleaded,routh
2695,2696,the very next morning pegeen moved out of the house they jointly owned taking with her one of the two catsnot so great for the cats said pegeen but that was the least of itand she settled into a room at a local motel,she could barely gather enough composure to meet with her classes,routh
2697,2698,lonely as it had become living with priscilla the wound of the betrayal the nature of the betrayal was far worse,she cried all the time and began to write letters to colleges hundreds of miles from montana looking for a new job,routh
2699,2700,she went to a conference where colleges were interviewing people in environmental science and found a position in the east after sleeping with the dean who became smitten by her and subsequently hired her,the dean was still pegeen is devoted protector and paramour when pegeen drove over to pay axler a visit and determined that after seventeen years as a lesbian she wanted a manthis man this actor twentyfive years her senior and her family is friend from decades back,routh
2701,2702,if priscilla could become a heterosexual male pegeen could become a heterosexual female,that first afternoon axler tripped and fell hard on the wide stone step as he led pegeen into the house gashing the meaty side of the hand with which he broke the fall,routh
2703,2704,where is your firstaid stuff,she asked,routh
2705,2706,he told her and she went inside to get it and came back out and cleaned his wound with cotton and peroxide and covered it with a couple of bandaids,she had also brought him a glass of water to drink,routh
2707,2708,nobody had brought him a glass of water for a long time,he invited her to stay for dinner,routh
2709,2710,she wound up making it,nobody had made him dinner for a long time either,routh
2711,2712,she finished off a bottle of beer while he sat at the kitchen table and watched her prepare the meal,there was a chunk of parmesan cheese in the refrigerator there were eggs there was some bacon there was half a container of cream and with that and a pound of pasta she made them spaghetti carbonara,routh
2713,2714,he was remembering the sight of her as an infant at her mother is breast while observing her as she worked in his kitchen behaving as though the place were hers,she was a vibrant presence solid fit brimming with energy and soon enough he was no longer feeling that he was alone on earth without his talent,routh
2715,2716,he was happyan unexpected feeling,usually at the dinner hour he had the worst blues of the day,routh
2717,2718,while she cooked he went into the living room and put on brendel playing schubert,he could not remember the last time he had bothered listening to music and back in the best days of his marriage it was playing all the time,routh
2719,2720,what happened to your wife,she asked after they had eaten the spaghetti and shared a bottle of wine,routh
2721,2722,does not matter,too tedious to discuss,routh
2723,2724,how long have you been out here without anyone else,long enough to be lonelier than i ever thought i could be,routh
2725,2726,it is sometimes astonishing sitting here month after month season after season to think that it is all going on without you,just as it will when you die,routh
2727,2728,what happened to acting,she asked,routh
2729,2730,i do not act anymore,that ca not be she said,routh
2731,2732,what happened,also too tedious to go into,routh
2733,2734,have you retired or did something happen,he stood up and came around the table and she stood and he kissed her,routh
2735,2736,she smiled with surprise,laughing she said i am a sexual anomaly,routh
2737,2738,i sleep with women,that was not hard to figure out,routh
2739,2740,here he kissed her a second time,so what are you doing,routh
2741,2742,she asked,he shrugged,routh
2743,2744,i ca not say that i know,you have never been with a man,routh
2745,2746,he asked her,when i was in college,routh
2747,2748,are you with a woman now,more or less she replied,routh
2749,2750,are you,no,routh
2751,2752,he felt the strength in her wellmuscled arms he fumbled with her heavy breasts he cupped her hard behind in his hands and drew her toward him so that they kissed again,then he led her to the sofa in the living room where blushing furiously as he watched her she undid her jeans and was with a man for the first time since college,routh
2753,2754,he was with a lesbian for the first time in his life,months later he had say to her how come you drove over that afternoon,routh
2755,2756,i wanted to see if anybody was with you,and when you saw,routh
2757,2758,i thought why not me,you calculate like that all the time,routh
2759,2760,it is not calculation,it is pursuing what you want,routh
2761,2762,and she added not pursuing what you no longer want,the dean who had hired her and brought her to prescott was furious when pegeen told her their affair was over,routh
2763,2764,she was eight years older than pegeen earned more than twice as much as pegeen had been an important dean for over a decade and so she refused to believe it or to allow it,she phoned pegeen to scold her first thing every morning and called her numerous times during the night to shout at her and insult her and demand an explanation,routh
2765,2766,once she phoned from a local cemetery where she announced she was stomping around in a fury because of the way pegeen had treated her,she accused pegeen of exploiting her to get the job and then opportunistically dropping her within only weeks of taking it,routh
2767,2768,when pegeen went to the pool to work out with the swim team twice a week in the late afternoon the dean turned up to swim at that hour and arranged to take the locker next to pegeen is,the dean called to invite her to a movie to a lecture to a concert and dinner,routh
2769,2770,she called every other day to tell pegeen that she wanted to see her that coming weekend,pegeen had already made it clear that she was busy on weekends and did not want to resume seeing her again,routh
2771,2772,the dean pleaded she shoutedsometimes she cried,pegeen was the person she could not live without,routh
2773,2774,a strong successful competent woman of fortyeight a dynamic woman touted to be prescott is next president and how easily she could be derailed,one sunday afternoon she called his house and asked to speak to pegeen stapleford,routh
2775,2776,axler put down the phone and went into the living room to tell pegeen the call was for her,who is it,routh
2777,2778,he asked her,without hesitation she replied who else could it be,routh
2779,2780,louise,how does she know where i am,routh
2781,2782,how did she get your number,he returned to the phone and said there is no pegeen stapleford here,routh
2783,2784,thank you the caller said and hung up,the next week pegeen ran into louise on the campus,routh
2785,2786,louise told her that she was going away for ten days and that when she came back pegeen had better do something for her like make her dinner,afterward pegeen was frightened first because louise would not leave her alone even after she once again clarified that the affair was over and second because of the threat louise is anger embodied,routh
2787,2788,what is threatened,he asked,routh
2789,2790,what,my job,routh
2791,2792,there is no limit to the harm she can do me if she sets her mind to it,well you have me do not you,routh
2793,2794,he said,what does that mean,routh
2795,2796,you have me to fall back on,i am right here,routh
2797,2798,he was here,she was here,routh
2799,2800,everyone is possibilities had changed dramatically,the first article of clothing he bought her was a tan closefitting waistlength leather jacket with a shearling lining that he saw in the window of a shop in the upscale village that lay ten miles through the woods from his house,routh
2801,2802,he went in and purchased what he guessed correctly to be her size,the jacket cost a thousand dollars,routh
2803,2804,she had never owned anything that expensive before and she had never looked so good in anything before,he told her it was for her birthday whenever that fell,routh
2805,2806,for the next few days she did not take it off her back,then they drove to new york ostensibly to have some good meals and go to the movies and get away for the weekend together and he bought her more clothesby the time the weekend was over more than five thousand dollars worth of skirts blouses belts jackets shoes and sweaters outfits in which she looked very different from the way she looked in the clothes she had brought east with her from montana,routh
2807,2808,when she had first showed up at his house she owned little that could not be worn by a sixteenyearold boyonly now had she begun to give up walking like a sixteenyearold boy,in the new york stores after trying on something new in the dressing room she had come out to where he was waiting for her to show him how it looked and to hear what he thought,routh
2809,2810,she was paralyzingly selfconscious for only the first few hours after that she let it happen eventually emerging coquettishly from the dressing room smiling with delight,he bought her necklaces bracelets and earrings,routh
2811,2812,he bought her luxurious lingerie to replace the sport bras and the gray briefs,he bought her little satin babydolls to replace her flannel pajamas,routh
2813,2814,he bought her calfhigh boots a brown pair and a black pair,the only coat she owned she had inherited from priscilla is late mother,routh
2815,2816,it was way too large for her and shaped like a box and so over the next few months he bought her flattering new coatsfive of them,he could have bought her a hundred,routh
2817,2818,he could not stop,living as he did he rarely spent anything on himself and nothing made him happier than making her look like she had never looked before,routh
2819,2820,and in time nothing seemed to make her happier,it was an orgy of spoiling and spending that suited them both just fine,routh
2821,2822,still she did not want her parents to learn about the affair,it would cause them too much pain,routh
2823,2824,he thought more pain than when you told them you were a lesbian,she had explained to him what had happened on that day back when she was twentythree,routh
2825,2826,her mother had cried and said i ca not imagine anything worse and her father feigned acceptance but did not smile again for months,there was a lot of trauma in that home for a long time after pegeen told them what she was,routh
2827,2828,why would learning about me cause them so much pain,he asked her,routh
2829,2830,because they have known you so long,because you are all the same age,routh
2831,2832,as you wish he said,but he could not stop pondering her motive,routh
2833,2834,perhaps she was acting out of the habit of keeping her life in different compartments the sexual life strictly separated from her life as a daughter maybe she did not want the sex contaminated or domesticated by filial concerns,maybe there was some embarrassment about her turning from sleeping with women to sleeping with a man and an uncertainty as to whether the switch was going to be permanent,routh
2835,2836,but regardless of what was prompting her he felt he had made a mistake in allowing her to keep their connection a secret from her family,he was too old not to feel compromised by having to be kept a secret,routh
2837,2838,nor did he see why a fortyyearold woman should be so concerned about what her parents thought especially a fortyyearold woman who had done all sorts of things that her parents disapproved of and whose opposition she weathered,he did not like that she was showing herself to be less than her age but he did not push it not for now and so her family continued to think she was going along leading her regular life while with the passing months she seemed to him slowly but naturally to shed the last visible signs of what she now referred to as my seventeenyear mistake,routh
2839,2840,nonetheless one morning at breakfast as much to his own surprise as hers axler said is this something you really want pegeen,though we have enjoyed each other so far and the novelty has been strong and the feeling has been strong and the pleasure has been strong i wonder if you know what you are doing,routh
2841,2842,yes i do,i love this she said and i do not want it to stop,routh
2843,2844,but you understand what i am referring to,yes,routh
2845,2846,matters of age,matters of sexual history,routh
2847,2848,your old connection to my parents,probably twenty things besides,routh
2849,2850,and none of them bother me,do any of them bother you,routh
2851,2852,would it perhaps be a good idea he replied before hearts get broken for us to back off,are not you happy,routh
2853,2854,she asked,my life has been very precarious over the past few years,routh
2855,2856,i do not feel the strength that it would take having my hopes dashed,i have had my share of marital misery and before that my share of breakups with women,routh
2857,2858,it is always painful it is always harsh and i do not want to court it at this stage of life,simon we both have been dropped she said,routh
2859,2860,you were at the bottom of a breakdown and your wife picked up and left you to fend for yourself,i was betrayed by priscilla,routh
2861,2862,not only did she leave me she left the body that i had once loved to become a man with a mustache named jack,if we do fail let it be because of us not because of them not because of your past or mine,routh
2863,2864,i do not want to encourage you in a risk and i know it is a risk,for both of us by the way,routh
2865,2866,i feel the risk too,it is of a different sort than yours of course,routh
2867,2868,but the worst outcome possible is for you to take yourself away from me,i could not bear to lose you now,routh
2869,2870,i will if i have to but as for the riskthe risk has been taken,we have already done it,routh
2871,2872,it is too late for protection by withdrawing,you are saying you do not want to get out of this thing while the getting is good,routh
2873,2874,absolutely,i want you you see,routh
2875,2876,i have come to trust that i have you,do not pull away from me,routh
2877,2878,i love this and i do not want it to stop,there is nothing else i can say,routh
2879,2880,all i can say is that i will try if you will,this is no longer just a fling,routh
2881,2882,we took the risk he said echoing her,we took the risk she replied,routh
2883,2884,four words meaning that it would be the worst possible time for her to be dropped by him,she will say whatever she needs to say he thought even if the dialogue verges on soap opera to keep it going because she is still aching all these months later from the priscilla shock and the louise ultimatums,routh
2885,2886,it is not deception her taking this lineit is the way we are instinctively strategic,but eventually a day will come axler thought when circumstances render her in a much stronger position for it to end whereas i will have wound up in a weaker position merely from having been too indecisive to cut it off now,routh
2887,2888,and when she is strong and i am weak the blow that is dealt will be unbearable,he believed he was seeing clearly into their future yet he could do nothing to alter the prospect,routh
2889,2890,he was too happy to alter it,over the months she had let her hair grow nearly to her shoulders thick brown hair with a natural sheen that she began to think about having cut in a style unlike the cropped mannish one she had favored throughout her adult life,routh
2891,2892,one weekend she arrived with a couple of magazines full of photos of different hairstyles magazines of a kind he had never seen before,where had you get these,routh
2893,2894,he asked her,one of my students she said,routh
2895,2896,they sat side by side on the sofa in the living room while she turned pages and bent back corners where there was a style pictured that might suit her,finally they narrowed their preferences down to two and she tore out those pages and he phoned an actress friend in manhattan to ask her where pegeen should go to get her hair cut the same friend who had told him where to take pegeen shopping for clothes and where to go to buy her jewelry,routh
2897,2898,wish i had a sugar daddy the friend said,but he had not understood it that way,routh
2899,2900,all he was doing was helping pegeen to be a woman he would want instead of a woman another woman would want,together they were absorbed in making this happen,routh
2901,2902,he went with her to an expensive hairdresser is in the east sixties,a young japanese woman cut pegeen is hair after looking at the two photos they had brought,routh
2903,2904,he had never seen pegeen look as disarmed as she did sitting in the chair in front of the mirror after her hair had been washed,he had never before seen her look so weakened or so at a loss as to how to behave,routh
2905,2906,the sight of her silent sheepish sitting there at the edge of humiliation unable even to look at her reflection gave the haircut an entirely transformed meaning igniting all his selfmistrust and causing him to wonder as he had more than once if he was not being blinded by a stupendous and desperate illusion,what is the draw of a woman like this to a man who is losing so much,routh
2907,2908,was not he making her pretend to be someone other than who she was,was not he dressing her up in costume as though a costly skirt could dispose of nearly two decades of lived experience,routh
2909,2910,was not he distorting her while telling himself a lieand a lie that in the end might be anything but harmless,what if he proved to be no more than a brief male intrusion into a lesbian life,routh
2911,2912,but then pegeen is thick brown shiny hair was cutcut to below the base of her neck in a choppy way so none of the layers were even a look that gave her precisely the right caredfor devilmaycare air of slight dishevelmentand she seemed so transformed that all these unanswered questions ceased to trouble him they did not even require serious thought,it took her a little longer than it took him to be convinced that the two of them had chosen correctly but in only a few days the haircut and all it signified about her allowing him to shape her to determine what she should look like and advance an idea of what her true life was appeared to have become more than just acceptable,routh
2913,2914,perhaps because she looked so great in his eyes she did not bridle at continuing to submit to his ministrations alien though that might have been to a lifelong sense of herself,if indeed hers was the will that was submittingif indeed it was not she who had taken him over completely taken him up and taken him over,routh
2915,2916,late one friday afternoon pegeen arrived at his house in distressout in lansing her family had received a midnight phone call from louise to tell them how she had been opportunistically exploited and deceived by their daughter,what else,routh
2917,2918,he said,his question brought pegeen close to tears,routh
2919,2920,she told them about you,she said i was living with you,routh
2921,2922,and what did they say to that,my mother was the one who answered,routh
2923,2924,he was asleep,and how did she take it,routh
2925,2926,she asked me if it was true,i told her i was not living with you,routh
2927,2928,i told her we had become close friends,what did your father say,routh
2929,2930,he never came to the phone,why did not he,routh
2931,2932,i do not know,that miserable bitch,routh
2933,2934,why wo not she stop,she cried,routh
2935,2936,that obsessive possessive jealous rancorous bitch,does it really matter to you that she told your parents,routh
2937,2938,does not it matter to you,pegeen asked him,routh
2939,2940,only inasmuch as it troubles you,otherwise not at all,routh
2941,2942,i think it is all to the good,what do i say when i talk to my father,routh
2943,2944,she asked,pegeen mikesay whatever you like,routh
2945,2946,suppose he decides not to talk to me at all,i doubt that will happen,routh
2947,2948,suppose he wants to talk to you,then he and i will talk axler said,routh
2949,2950,how angry is he,your father is a reasonable and sensible man,routh
2951,2952,why would he be angry,oh that bitchshe is completely whacked,routh
2953,2954,she is out of control,yes he said the thought of you tortures her,routh
2955,2956,but you are not out of control i am not and neither are your mother and father,then why did not my father speak to me,routh
2957,2958,if you are so worried call and ask him,perhaps you had like me to speak to him,routh
2959,2960,no i will do iti will do it myself,she waited until after they had eaten before phoning lansing and then doing it from her study behind the closed door,routh
2961,2962,after fifteen minutes she came out carrying the phone and pointed with it toward him,axler took the phone,routh
2963,2964,asa,hello,routh
2965,2966,hi there,i hear you seduced my daughter,routh
2967,2968,i am having an affair with her that is true,well i ca not say i am not a little astonished,routh
2969,2970,well axler replied with a laugh i ca not say that i am not either,when she told me she was going to visit you i really never figured that this was in the cards asa said,routh
2971,2972,well i am glad you are all right with it axler replied,there was a pause before asa answered pegeen is a free agent,routh
2973,2974,she left her childhood long ago,look carol wants to say hello asa said and then passed the phone to his wife,routh
2975,2976,well well carol said who ever could have imagined this when we were all kiddies in new york,no one axler replied,routh
2977,2978,i could not have imagined it the day she showed up here,is my daughter doing the right thing,routh
2979,2980,carol asked him,i think so,routh
2981,2982,what is your plan,carol asked,routh
2983,2984,i have no plan,pegeen has always surprised us,routh
2985,2986,she surprised me too axler said,i think she is no less surprised,routh
2987,2988,well she surprised her friend louise,he did not bother to reply that louise was something of a surprise herself,routh
2989,2990,carol is intention clearly was to be mild and friendly but he was sure from the brittleness of her tone that the call was an ordeal and that she and asa were simply doing the right thing which was their way doing the sensible thing that would make pegeen happiest,they did not want to alienate her at forty as they had at twentythree when she had told them she was a lesbian,routh
2991,2992,in fact carol flew in from michigan the following saturday to meet pegeen in new york for lunch,pegeen drove down to the city that morning and got back about eight that night,routh
2993,2994,he had made dinner for them and only when dinner was over did he ask her how it had gone,well what did she say,routh
2995,2996,axler asked,do you want me to be entirely honest,routh
2997,2998,pegeen replied,please he said,routh
2999,3000,all right she said i will try to remember as exactly as i can,it was kind of the benign third degree,routh
3001,3002,there was nothing vulgar or selfserving about her,just mother is flatout kansas candor,routh
3003,3004,go ahead,you want to know everything pegeen said,routh
3005,3006,yes he replied,well first off at the restaurant she breezed right by my tableshe failed to recognize me,routh
3007,3008,i said mother and then she turned back and she said oh my goodness it is my daughter,do not you look pretty,routh
3009,3010,and i said pretty,did not you think i was pretty before,routh
3011,3012,and she said a new hairdo clothes of a kind i never saw you wear before,and i said more feminine you mean,routh
3013,3014,hadecidedly she said yes,it is very flattering dear,routh
3015,3016,how long has this been going on,i told her and she said that is a very nice haircut,routh
3017,3018,it could not have been inexpensive,and i said to her i am just trying something new,routh
3019,3020,and she said i guess you are trying something new in many ways,i came out because i want to be sure that you have thought through all the implications of your affair,routh
3021,3022,i told her that i was not sure anyone ever thinks through being with someone romantically,i told her that it made me very happy right now,routh
3023,3024,and so she said news reached us that he was in a psychiatric hospital,some people say he was there six months some say a yeari do not really know the facts,routh
3025,3026,i told her that you were there for twentysix days a full twelve months ago and that it had to do with performance problems on the stage,i said that you temporarily lost your power to act and separated from your acting you came apart,routh
3027,3028,i said that whatever emotional or mental problems you had then they did not manifest themselves in our life together now,i said you were as sane or saner than anyone i have ever been with and that when we are together you seem stable and quite happy,routh
3029,3030,and she asked is he still in the same bind with his acting,and i said yes and noyou were but i thought that as a result of meeting me and being with me it was no longer the same tragedy it had been,routh
3031,3032,it was now more like an athlete who is been injured and sidelined and is waiting to heal,and she said you do not feel you have to rescue him do you,routh
3033,3034,i assured her that i did not and she asked how you filled your time and i said he sees me,i think he plans to continue seeing me,routh
3035,3036,he reads,he buys me clothes,routh
3037,3038,well she leaped on thatso these are clothes he bought for you,well i would think there might be a certain rescue fantasy working there,routh
3039,3040,i told her that she was making too much of it and that it was just fun for both of us and why could not we leave it at that,i said he is not trying to influence me in any way i do not want to be influenced,routh
3041,3042,she asked  hado you go with him when he buys you clothes,and i said usually,routh
3043,3044,but again i think it makes him happy,and i can see that in him,routh
3045,3046,since it happens to be an experiment i want to conduct as well i told her i do not see why anyone should be concerned,and that is when the tenor of the conversation changed,routh
3047,3048,she said well i have to tell you that i am concerned,you are new to the world of men and it strikes me as strangeor maybe not so strangethat the man you should choose to initiate this new life with is a man twentyfive years older than you are who has been through a breakdown that led to his being institutionalized,routh
3049,3050,and who now is essentially unemployed,all those things do not bode well to me,routh
3051,3052,i told her that it did not seem any worse than the situation i was in before with someone whom i once loved very much and who told me one morning i ca not go on in this body and decided she wanted to be a man,and then i made my speech the speech i had prepared and recited aloud driving down,routh
3053,3054,i said as for his age mother i do not see it as a problem,if i am going to try to be attractive to men and also learn whether i am attracted to men this seems to be the best measure of it,routh
3055,3056,this person is the test,the twentyfive years register with me as twentyfive years more experience than someone would have if i were trying this with a man my own age,routh
3057,3058,we are not talking about getting married,i told youwe are just enjoying each other,routh
3059,3060,i am enjoying him in part because he is twentyfive years older,and she said and he is enjoying you because you are twentyfive years younger,routh
3061,3062,i said  hado not be offended mother but are you at all jealous,and she laughed and said  hadear i am sixtythree and happily married to your father for over forty years,routh
3063,3064,it is true she said and you may get a kick out of knowing this but when i played pegeen mike and simon played christy in the synge play i had a crush on him,who did not,routh
3065,3066,he was wildly attractive energetic exuberant playful he was a big forceful actor a wonderful actor already his talent obviously a huge cut above everyone else is,so yes i had a crush but i was already married and pregnant with you,routh
3067,3068,the crush was something i passed through,i think i have seen him no more than ten times in the intervening years,routh
3069,3070,i respect him enormously as an actor,but i continue to be concerned by that hospital stay,routh
3071,3072,it is no small thing for someone to commit himself to a psychiatric hospital and to be there for however long or short a period it was,look she said for me the important thing is that you are not going into this blind,routh
3073,3074,you do not want to be doing something that for lack of experience a twentyyearold might do,i do not want you to act out of innocence,routh
3075,3076,and i said i am hardly innocent mother,i asked her what she was afraid might happen that could not happen with anyone,routh
3077,3078,and she said what am i afraid of,i am afraid of the fact that he is growing older by the day,routh
3079,3080,that is the way it works,you are sixtyfive and then you are sixtysix and then you are sixtyseven and so on,routh
3081,3082,in a few years he will be seventy,you will be with a seventyyearold man,routh
3083,3084,and it wo not stop there she told me,after that he will become a seventyfiveyearold man,routh
3085,3086,it never stops,it goes on,routh
3087,3088,he will begin to have health problems such as the elderly have and maybe things even worse and you are going to be the person responsible for his care,are you in love with him,routh
3089,3090,she said,i said i thought that i was,routh
3091,3092,and she asked is he in love with you,and i said i thought that you were,routh
3093,3094,i said i think it will be fine mother,it has occurred to me that he has to worry more than i do,routh
3095,3096,that this is a more precarious situation for him than it is for me,she asked how so,routh
3097,3098,i said well as you say i am trying this for the first time,although it is a novelty for him as well it is not nearly as much of one as it is for me,routh
3099,3100,i have been very surprised by how much i have enjoyed it,but i could not yet declare that it is definitely the permutation i will always want,routh
3101,3102,and she said well all right i do not want to go on and on and give this an urgency it does not have and may never have,i just thought it was important for me to see you and i must say once again i am very impressed by your appearance,routh
3103,3104,and i asked her  hadoes it make you think you would still have preferred a daughter who was straight,she said it makes me think that you would prefer not to be a lesbian any longer,routh
3105,3106,you can of course do whatever you like,in your independent youth you educated us about that,routh
3107,3108,but i ca not fail to notice the physical change,you have taken great care that everybody should notice that,routh
3109,3110,you even do your eyes,it is an impressive transformation,routh
3111,3112,that is when i said what do you think dad would think,and she said he could not be here because a new play opens in a few days and he ca not leave it,routh
3113,3114,but he wanted to come to see you and as soon as the play is on he will come if that is all right with you,and then you can ask him directly what he thinks,routh
3115,3116,so there we are,want to go shopping,routh
3117,3118,she said to me,i am admiring your shoes,routh
3119,3120,where had you get them,i told her and she said would you object if i bought a pair like that,routh
3121,3122,want to go with me to get them,and so we took a taxi to madison avenue and she bought a pair of twotoned pinkandbeige patent leather pumps with a pointy toe and a kitten heel in her size,routh
3123,3124,now she is walking around michigan in my prada shoes,she also admired my skirt so we went shopping for a skirt for her cut like mine down in soho,routh
3125,3126,good ending is not it,but late in the afternoon you know what she said before leaving for the airport with her bags from the shopping,routh
3127,3128,this and not the shoes is the true ending,she said what you were trying to do with me at lunch pegeen was make it sound like the sanest and most reasonable arrangement on the planet when of course it is not,routh
3129,3130,but people on the outside are only going to frustrate you if they try to talk you out of what you wake up every day wanting and what is buoying you above everybody is humdrum sameness,i have to tell you that when i first learned of this i thought it was wacky and ill advised,routh
3131,3132,and now that i have spoken with you and spent the day with you and been shopping with you for the first time really since you went off to college now that i have seen that you are completely calm rational and thoughtful about it i still think it is wacky and ill advised,here pegeen stopped,routh
3133,3134,it had taken her close to half an hour to repeat the conversation to him and in that time he had not spoken or moved from his chair nor had he told her to stop on any of those several occasions when he thought he had heard enough,but it was not in his interest to tell her to stopit was in his interest to find out everything to hear everything even if he had to to hear her say i could not yet declare that it is definitely the permutation i will always want,routh
3135,3136,that is it,that is all pegeen said,routh
3137,3138,that is pretty close to what was said,was it better or worse than you expected,routh
3139,3140,he asked,much better,routh
3141,3142,i was very anxious driving down there,well it sounds as though you had no need to be,routh
3143,3144,you handled yourself very well,then i was very anxious coming back about telling you all this and knowing that if i was truthful you were not going to like everything you heard,routh
3145,3146,well there was no need for that either,really,routh
3147,3148,i hope my telling you everything has not turned you against my mother,your mother said what a mother would say,routh
3149,3150,i understand,he laughed and said i ca not say that i disagree with her,routh
3151,3152,softly and flushing as she spoke pegeen said i hope it has not turned you against me,it is made me admire you he said,routh
3153,3154,you did not flinch from anything either in talking with her or now in talking with me,truly,routh
3155,3156,you are not hurt,no,routh
3157,3158,but of course he washurt and angry,he had sat there listening quietlyintently listening as he had been listening all his life offstage and onbut he was particularly stung by carol is clarification of the aging process and the jeopardy in which it placed her daughter,routh
3159,3160,nor however softly he now spoke was he unperturbed by wacky and ill advised,the whole thing disgusted him really,routh
3161,3162,it might be all right if pegeen were twentytwo and there were forty years difference between them but why this peculiar proprietary relationship with an adventurous fortyyearold,and what the hell did a woman of forty care what her parents wanted,routh
3163,3164,a part of them he thought should be happy that she was with him if only from a venal point of view,here is this eminent man with a lot of money who is going to take care of her,routh
3165,3166,after all she is not getting any younger herself,she settles down with someone who is achieved something in lifewhat is so wrong with that,routh
3167,3168,instead the message is do not set yourself up to be caretaker of a crazy old guy,however since pegeen had seemingly rejected carol is account of him he thought it best to stay silent about that as well as everything else that he did not like,routh
3169,3170,what would be the good of attacking her mother for butting in,better to appear to laugh it off,routh
3171,3172,if she should come to see him through her mother is eyes there was nothing he could say or do to stop her anyway,you are wonderful to me pegeen said to him,routh
3173,3174,you are what the doctor ordered,and you to me he said and he left it at that,routh
3175,3176,he did not go on from there to add as for your parents i had just as soon spare them but i ca not arrange my life according to their feelings,their feelings do not matter that much to me frankly and at this stage of the game they really should not matter that much to you either,routh
3177,3178,no he would not take off in that direction,instead he would sit tight and be patient and hope the family would fade away,routh
3179,3180,the next day pegeen devoted to stripping the wallpaper in her study,the wallpaper had been chosen by victoria many years before and though axler did not care about it one way or another pegeen could not stand the look of it and asked if she could take it down,routh
3181,3182,he told her the room was hers to do with as she liked as was the upstairs back bedroom and the bathroom beside it as indeed was every room in the house,he told her he could easily get a painter in to do the job but she insisted on stripping the walls and painting them herself thereby making the study officially hers,routh
3183,3184,she had all the necessary tools for stripping wallpaper at her house and she had brought them with her to begin the job that sunday the very day after her mother down in new york had questioned the wisdom of her being there at all,he must have gone in to watch her removing the wallpaper ten times during the course of the day and each time came away with the same reassuring thought she would not be working away like that if carol had succeeded in persuading her to leave him,routh
3185,3186,she would not be doing what she was doing if she were not planning to stay,that evening pegeen drove back to the college where she had a class to teach early the following morning,routh
3187,3188,when the phone rang around ten on sunday night he thought it was she who was calling to say that she was safely home,it was not,routh
3189,3190,it was the jilted dean,be forewarned mr,routh
3191,3192,famous she is desirable she is audacious and she is utterly ruthless utterly coldhearted incomparably selfish and completely amoral,and with that the dean hung up,routh
3193,3194,the next morning axler dropped off his car to be serviced and the mechanic gave him a ride back home in his tow truck,he would return the car to axler at the end of the day when the job was done,routh
3195,3196,around noon when axler went into the kitchen to make a sandwich for himself he happened to look out the window and saw something dart across the field adjacent to the barn and then disappear behind it,it was a person this time not a possum,routh
3197,3198,he stood back from the kitchen window and waited to see if perhaps there was a second third or fourth person lurking anywhere else,there had been a worrisome series of breakins throughout the county in recent months mainly into unoccupied houses owned by weekenders and he wondered if the absence of a car in his carport had caught the attention of the robbers and made him a target for a daytime theft,routh
3199,3200,quickly he headed for the attic to get his shotgun and load it with shells,then he went back downstairs to survey his property from the kitchen window,routh
3201,3202,a hundred yards to the north on the road that ran perpendicular to his he could see a parked car but it was too far for him to make out whether there was anyone inside it,it was unusual to see a car parked there at any time of the day or nightthere was a thickly wooded hill on the far side of the road and on his side open fields leading up to his barn carport and house,routh
3203,3204,suddenly the person hiding back of the barn came sneaking along the side of the barn and made a rush for the front of the house,from the kitchen he saw that the intruder was a tall thin redheaded woman dressed in jeans and a navy blue ski jacket,routh
3205,3206,she was peering into the living room through a front window,as he was still uncertain whether or not she was alone for the moment he froze the gun in his hands,routh
3207,3208,soon she began to move from one window to the next stopping each time to get a good look at the room inside,he slipped out of the house through the back door and without her seeing him came to within ten feet of where she was staring into one of the living room windows on the south side of the house,routh
3209,3210,aiming the rifle at her he spoke,what can i do for you lady,routh
3211,3212,oh,she cried when she turned and saw him,routh
3213,3214,oh i am sorry,are you alone,routh
3215,3216,yes,i am alone,routh
3217,3218,i am louise renner,you are the dean,routh
3219,3220,yes,she did not look much older than pegeen but she was a good deal taller only inches shorter than he was and what with her erect carriage and the red hair pulled away from her high forehead and knotted severely at the back of her neck there was a heroically statuesque aura to this woman,routh
3221,3222,what do you think you are doing,he asked her,routh
3223,3224,i am trespassing i know,i intended no harm,routh
3225,3226,i thought no one was home,have you been here before,routh
3227,3228,only to drive by,why,routh
3229,3230,could you lower that gun,it is making me very nervous,routh
3231,3232,well you made me nervous peeking into my windows,i am sorry,routh
3233,3234,i apologize,i have been stupid,routh
3235,3236,this is shameful,i will go,routh
3237,3238,what were you up to,you know what i was up to she said,routh
3239,3240,you tell me,i only wanted to see where she goes every weekend,routh
3241,3242,you are in a bad way,you drove from vermont to find that out,routh
3243,3244,she promised we had be together forever and three weeks later she left,i apologize again,routh
3245,3246,this has never happened to me before,i should never have come here,routh
3247,3248,and it probably does not help much your meeting me,it does not,routh
3249,3250,it makes you boil with jealousy he said,with hatred if you want the truth,routh
3251,3252,it is you who phoned last night,i am not completely in charge of myself she replied,routh
3253,3254,you are obsessed so you phone you are obsessed so you stalk,you are a very attractive woman nonetheless,routh
3255,3256,i have never been told that before by a man with a gun,i do not know why she left you for me he said,routh
3257,3258,oh do not you,you are a redhaired valkyrie and i am an old man,routh
3259,3260,an old man who is a star mr,axler,routh
3261,3262,do not pretend to be no one,would you like to come inside,routh
3263,3264,he asked,why,routh
3265,3266,do you want to seduce me too,is that your specialty retooling lesbians,routh
3267,3268,madam it is not i who was the peeping tom,it is not i who phoned her parents in michigan at midnight,routh
3269,3270,it is not i who anonymously phoned mr,famous last night,routh
3271,3272,no need to take the accusatory tone so quickly,i am not myself,routh
3273,3274,do you think she is worth it,no,routh
3275,3276,of course not she said,she is not at all beautiful,routh
3277,3278,she is not that intelligent,and she is not that grown up,routh
3279,3280,she is an unusually childish person for her age,she is a kid really,routh
3281,3282,she turned her montana lover into a man,she is turned me into a beggar,routh
3283,3284,who knows what she is turning you into,she leaves a trail of disaster,routh
3285,3286,where does the power come from,take a guess he said,routh
3287,3288,is it that that makes for disaster,the dean asked,routh
3289,3290,something about her sexually is very potent he said and saw her cringe at the words,but then it could not be easy for the loser to stand there and confront the person who had won,routh
3291,3292,there is plenty that is potent the dean said,she is a girlboy,routh
3293,3294,she is a childadult,there is an adolescent in her that is not grown up,routh
3295,3296,she is a cunning naif,but it is not her sexuality on its own that does itit is us,routh
3297,3298,it is we who endow her with the power to wreck,pegeen is nobody you know,routh
3299,3300,you would not be suffering so if she were nobody,she would not be here if she were nobody,routh
3301,3302,look you might as well step inside,then you can see everything up close,routh
3303,3304,and he could hear more about pegeen seared though her observations would be by pegeen is having exploited her,yes he wanted to hear her speak out of the depths of her wound about the closest person on earth to him,routh
3305,3306,this has been more than enough the dean said,come inside he said,routh
3307,3308,no,are you afraid of me,routh
3309,3310,he asked,i have done something foolish for which i apologize,routh
3311,3312,i have trespassed and i am sorry,and now i had like you to let me go,routh
3313,3314,i am not holding you,you have a way of trying to turn the moral tables on me,routh
3315,3316,but i did not invite you here in the first place,then why do you want me to come inside,routh
3317,3318,because of the triumph it would be to sleep with the woman that pegeen used to sleep with,i have no such ambition,routh
3319,3320,i am satisfied with things as they are,i was being polite,routh
3321,3322,i could offer you a cup of coffee,no the dean said coldly,routh
3323,3324,no you want to fuck me,is that what you want me to want,routh
3325,3326,that is what you want,is that what you came here to try to get me to do,routh
3327,3328,so as to pay pegeen back in kind,all at once she could conceal her misery no longer and burst into tears,routh
3329,3330,too late too late she sobbed,he did not understand what she was referring to but he did not ask,routh
3331,3332,she cried with her face buried in her hands while he turned and with the gun at his side went back into the house through the rear door trying to believe that nothing louise had said about pegeen either there outside the house or the night before on the phone could possibly be taken seriously,when he called pegeen that night he made no reference to what had happened that afternoon nor did he tell pegeen about louise is visit when she came for the weekend nor while they were having sex was he able to keep the redhaired valkyrie out of his mind and the fantasy of what had not happened,routh
3333,3334,the pain from the spinal condition made it impossible for him to fuck her from above or even from the side and so he lay on his back and she mounted him supporting herself on her knees and her hands so as not to lower her weight onto his pelvis,at first she lost all her knowhow up there and he had to guide her with his two hands to give her the idea,routh
3335,3336,i do not know what to do pegeen said shyly,you are on a horse axler told her,routh
3337,3338,ride it,when he worked his thumb into her ass she sighed with pleasure and whispered nobody is ever put anything in there beforeunlikely he whispered backand when later he put his cock in there she took as much as she could of it until she could not take any more,routh
3339,3340,did it hurt,he asked her,routh
3341,3342,it hurt but it is you,often she would hold his cock in her palm afterward and stare as the erection subsided,routh
3343,3344,what are you contemplating,he asked,routh
3345,3346,it fills you up she said the way dildos and fingers do not,it is alive,routh
3347,3348,it is a living thing,she quickly mastered riding the horse and soon while she worked slowly up and down she began to say hit me and when he hit her she said mockingly is that as hard as you can do it,routh
3349,3350,your face is already red,harder she said,routh
3351,3352,okay but why,because i have given you permission to do it,routh
3353,3354,because it hurts,because it makes me feel like a little girl and it makes me feel like a whore,routh
3355,3356,go ahead,harder,routh
3357,3358,she had a small plastic bag of sex toys that she brought with her one weekend and she spilled them out on the sheets when they were getting ready for bed,he had seen his share of dildos but never other than in pictures the strapon leather harness that held the dildo secure and enabled one woman to mount and penetrate another,routh
3359,3360,he had asked her to bring her toys with her and now he watched as she pulled the harness over her thighs and on up to her hips where she tightened it like a belt,she looked like a gunslinger getting dressed a gunslinger with a swagger,routh
3361,3362,then she inserted a green rubber dildo into a slot in the harness that was just about level with her clitoris,she stood alongside the bed wearing only that,routh
3363,3364,let me see yours she said,he removed his pants and threw them over the side of the bed while she grabbed the green cock and having lubricated it first with baby oil pretended to masturbate like a man,routh
3365,3366,admiringly he said it looks authentic,you want me to fuck you with it,routh
3367,3368,no thanks he said,i would not hurt you she said cajolingly kittenishly lowering her voice,routh
3369,3370,i promise to be very gentle with you she said,funny but you do not look like you will be gentle,routh
3371,3372,you must not be deceived by appearances,oh let me she said laughing you will like it,routh
3373,3374,it is a new frontier,you will like it,routh
3375,3376,no i had prefer you to suck me off he said,while i wear my cock she said,routh
3377,3378,yes,while i wear my big thick green cock,routh
3379,3380,that is what i want,while i wear my big green cock and you play with my tits,routh
3381,3382,that sounds right,and after i suck you off she said you will suck me off,routh
3383,3384,you will go down on my big green cock,i could do that he said,routh
3385,3386,sothat you could do,you draw strange boundaries,routh
3387,3388,in any event you should know you are still a very twisted man to be turned on by a girl like me,i may well be a twisted man but i do not believe you qualify as a girl like you any longer,routh
3389,3390,oh do not you now,not with that twohundreddollar haircut,routh
3391,3392,not with those clothes,not with your own mother following your fashion in footwear,routh
3393,3394,her hand continued slowly pumping the dildo,you really think you have fucked the lesbian out of me in ten months,routh
3395,3396,are you telling me that you are still sleeping with women,he asked,routh
3397,3398,she just kept pumping the dildo,are you pegeen,routh
3399,3400,with her free hand she held up two fingers,what does that mean,routh
3401,3402,he asked,twice,routh
3403,3404,with louise,do not be crazy,routh
3405,3406,with whom then,she flushed,routh
3407,3408,two teams of girls were playing softball on the field i drive by on the way to school,i parked the car and i got out and went over and stood by the bench,routh
3409,3410,after a pause she confessed when the game was over the pitcher with the blond ponytail came to the house with me,and the second time,routh
3411,3412,the other pitcher with the blond ponytail,that leaves quite a few players waiting their turn he said,routh
3413,3414,i did not intend to do it she said still stroking the green cock,perhaps pegeen mike he said falling into the irish accent he had not used since acting in playboy you should tell me if you have plans to do it again,routh
3415,3416,i had rather you would not he said knowing himself helpless to hold on to her and keep her his alone knowing that his ardor had been laughableand trying to hide his feelings behind the brogue,i told you i was not planning to do it at all and then either because desire had overpowered her or because she wanted to shut him up she lowered her lips down the length of his cock while his gaze remained hypnotically fastened to hers and the helplessness in him the knowledge that the affair was a futile folly and that pegeen is history was unmalleable and pegeen unattainable and that he was bringing a new misfortune down on his head began to abate,routh
3417,3418,the oddity of this combination would have put off many people,only the oddity was what was so exciting,routh
3419,3420,but the terror remained too the terror of going back to being completely finished,the terror of becoming the next louise the reproachful crazed avenging ex,routh
3421,3422,pegeens father had not helped things any when he had come to see her in new york on the saturday following her mother is visit,asa picked up where carol had left off in citing the dangers of their liaison moving from her lover is perilous age to his perilous psychiatric condition,routh
3423,3424,axler is strategy remained the same however tolerate whatever you hear do not rush to challenge the parents so long as pegeen does not yield,your mother was rightthat is a wonderful haircut she had reported her father is telling her,routh
3425,3426,and she was right about your clothes too he had said,yes,routh
3427,3428,do you think i look nice,you look terrific he had said,routh
3429,3430,better than i used to,different,routh
3431,3432,quite different,do i look more like the daughter you would have liked to have had,routh
3433,3434,you certainly have an air you never had before,now tell me about simon,routh
3435,3436,after the hard time he had at the kennedy center she had said he wound up at a psychiatric hospital,is that what you want to talk about,routh
3437,3438,she had asked,yes it is he had said,routh
3439,3440,we all have serious problems dad,we all have serious problems but we do not all wind up in psychiatric hospitals,routh
3441,3442,while we are at it she had said what about the difference in age,do not you want to ask about that,routh
3443,3444,let me ask you something else are you starstruck pegeen,you know how certain kinds of characters carry around their force field an encircling electric force field,routh
3445,3446,it comes in his case with being a star,are you starstruck,routh
3447,3448,she had laughed,at the beginning probably,routh
3449,3450,by this time i assure you he is just himself,may i ask how committed you are to each other,routh
3451,3452,he had said,we do not really talk about it,routh
3453,3454,maybe you ought to talk about it with me then,are you going to marry him pegeen,routh
3455,3456,i do not think he is interested in marrying anyone,are you,routh
3457,3458,why are you treating me as though i am twelve,she had said,routh
3459,3460,because it may be that where men are concerned you are more twelve than forty,look simon axler is an intriguing actor and probably to a woman an intriguing man,routh
3461,3462,but he is the age he is and you are the age you are,he has had the life he is had with its triumphant ups and its cataclysmic downs and you have had the life you have had,routh
3463,3464,and because those downs of his worry me greatly i am not going to talk about them as glibly as you do,i am not going to tell you that i am not going to try to bring any pressure to bear on you,routh
3465,3466,i am going to do just that,and that he didunlike the mother he did not end the day shopping with his daughter but instead he phoned her at her house every night around dinnertime to continue in much the same strong vein the conversation that had begun at lunch in new york,routh
3467,3468,rarely did father and daughter speak for less than an hour,in bed the evening after she had seen her father in new york axler had said to her i want you to know pegeen that i am flabbergasted by all this stuff with your parents,routh
3469,3470,i do not understand the place they are coming to play in our lives,it seems entirely too large and all things considered a little absurd,routh
3471,3472,on the other hand i recognize that at any stage of life there are mysteries about people and their attachments to their parents that can be surprising,this being so let me make a proposal if you want me to fly out to michigan and talk to your father i will fly out to michigan and i will sit and listen to every word he wants to say and when he tells me why he is against this i wo not even arguei will side with him,routh
3473,3474,i will tell him that everything he is concerned about makes perfect sense and that i agreeit is an unlikely arrangement on the face of it and there are to be sure risks involved,but the fact remains that his daughter and i feel as we do about each other,routh
3475,3476,and the fact that he and carol and i were friends as youngsters back in new york is of no relevance whatsoever,that is the only defense i will make pegeen if you want me to go and see him,routh
3477,3478,it is up to you,i will do it this week if you want me to,routh
3479,3480,i will do it tomorrow if that is what you want,his seeing me was quite enough she replied,routh
3481,3482,there is no need for this to be carried further,especially as you have made it clear that you think it is already been carried too far,routh
3483,3484,i am not so sure you are right he said,better to take on the raging fatherbut my father is not raging it is not in his nature to rage and i do not think there is any need to provoke a scene when there is not a scene in the offing,routh
3485,3486,he thought oh there is a scene in the offing all rightthe two upstanding squares you have for parents are not through,but he only said to her okay,routh
3487,3488,i simply wanted to make the offer,it is finally up to you,routh
3489,3490,but was that so,was not it up to him to neutralize them by opposing them rather than by simply leaving things to turn out opportunely on their own,routh
3491,3492,he should in fact have accompanied her to new yorkhe should have insisted on being there and facing asa down,despite what pegeen had said to assure him he was reluctant to give up the idea that asa was a father in a rage whom he should confront rather than flee,routh
3493,3494,are you starstruck,of course that is what he would believe he who never got the big roles,routh
3495,3496,yes thought axler that my fame stole away his only daughter the fame that asa himself could never garner,it was in the middle of the next week that he got around to reading the previous friday is county newspaper and the frontpage story about a murder that had taken place in a welltodo suburban town some twentyfive miles away,routh
3497,3498,a man in his forties a successful plastic surgeon had been shot dead by his estranged wife,the wife was sybil van buren,routh
3499,3500,the two were apparently living apart by then,she had driven to his house across town from hers and as soon as he opened the door had shot him twice in the chest killing him instantly,routh
3501,3502,she had dropped the murder weapon on the doorstep then gone back and sat in her parked car until the police came and took her to the station to be booked,when she had left home that morning she had already arranged for the babysitter to spend the day with the two children,routh
3503,3504,axler phoned pegeen and told her what had happened,did you think she could have done this,routh
3505,3506,pegeen asked,such a helpless person,routh
3507,3508,no,never,routh
3509,3510,she had the motivethe molestationbut homicide,she asked if i would murder him for her,routh
3511,3512,she said i need someone to kill this evil man,what a shocking story pegeen said,routh
3513,3514,this fragilelooking woman built on the frailest childlike scale,the least menacing person one could encounter,routh
3515,3516,they will never convict her pegeen said,maybe they will maybe they wo not,routh
3517,3518,maybe she will plead temporary insanity and get off,but what will become of her then,routh
3519,3520,what will become of the child,if the little girl was not already doomed because of what the stepfather did now she is doomed because of what her mother is done,routh
3521,3522,not to mention their little boy,would you like me to come tonight,routh
3523,3524,you sound shaky,no no he said,routh
3525,3526,i am all right,i have just never known anyone who is killed somebody off the stage,routh
3527,3528,i am going to come over later pegeen said,and when she did they sat in the living room after dinner and he repeated to her in detail everything he remembered sybil van buren saying to him at the hospital,routh
3529,3530,he found her letterthe letter that had been mailed to him in care of jerry is officeand gave it to pegeen to read,the husband claimed to be innocent axler explained,routh
3531,3532,he claimed she was seeing things,was she,routh
3533,3534,i did not think so,i saw her suffering,routh
3535,3536,i believed her story,during the day he had read the article again and again and repeatedly looked at the photograph of sybil that the paper had published a studio portrait in which she looked less like a married woman in her thirties let alone a clytemnestra than like a high school cheerleader someone who as yet had been through nothing in life,routh
3537,3538,the following day he phoned information and easy as that got the van burens phone number,when he called a woman answered who identified herself as sybil is sister,routh
3539,3540,he told her who he was and told her about sybil is letter,he read it to her over the phone,routh
3541,3542,they agreed she would pass it on to sybil is lawyer,are you able to see her,routh
3543,3544,he asked,only with the lawyer,routh
3545,3546,she gets teary about not seeing the children,otherwise she is unnervingly calm,routh
3547,3548,does she talk about the murder,she says it had to be done,routh
3549,3550,you had think it was her fiftieth not her first,she is in a very strange state,routh
3551,3552,the gravity seems to escape her,it is as though the gravity is all behind her,routh
3553,3554,for the moment he said,i have been thinking the same,routh
3555,3556,there is a great crash going to occur,she wo not be living behind this placid mask for long,routh
3557,3558,there must be a suicide watch on her cell,i am frightened of what is coming next,routh
3559,3560,of course,what she did in no way jibes with the woman i knew,routh
3561,3562,why did she do this after all this time,because even when john moved out he continued to deny everything and to tell her that she was delusional and that put her into a mad frenzy,routh
3563,3564,on the morning that she was going to see him she told me that by whatever means it took she was going to extract a confession from him,i said  hado not see him,routh
3565,3566,it will only drive you over the edge,and i was right,routh
3567,3568,i was the one who had wanted her to go to the district attorney and bring charges,i was the one who told her that she should have him put behind bars,routh
3569,3570,but she refused he was not a nobody and the case would wind up in the papers and on tv and alison would get dragged into a courtroom nightmare to be exposed to yet more horror,her saying this is why i never dreamed that extracting a confession by any means would involve the use of his hunting rifleusing his hunting rifle might wind up in the papers too you see,routh
3571,3572,but when she got to john is that saturday morning she did not wait for him to let her into the house,she did not wait to hear him speak a single word,routh
3573,3574,it is not that they had an argument and it escalated and she shot him,seeing his face was all it tookright there in the front doorway she pulled the trigger twice and he was dead,routh
3575,3576,she told me he wanted mayhem so i gave him mayhem,does the little girl know anything,routh
3577,3578,she has not been told yet,that is not going to be easy,routh
3579,3580,nothing about this is going to be easy,the late dr,routh
3581,3582,van buren made sure of that,the suffering that is going to be alison is is unimaginable to me,routh
3583,3584,axler repeated to himself for days afterward the suffering that is going to be alison is,it was probably the very thought that had driven sybil to murder her husbandthereby enlarging alison is suffering forever,routh
3585,3586,one night in bed pegeen said to him i have found a girl for you,she is on the prescott swim team,routh
3587,3588,i swim with her in the afternoon,lara,routh
3589,3590,how would you like me to bring you lara,she was slowly rising and falling above him and all the lights were out though the room was dimly lit by the full moon shining through the branches of the tall trees out back of the house,routh
3591,3592,tell me about lara he said,oh you had like her all right,routh
3593,3594,obviously you do already,i watch her in the pool,routh
3595,3596,i watch her in the locker room,a rich kid,routh
3597,3598,a privileged kid,she is never known a minute is hardship,routh
3599,3600,she is perfect,blond,routh
3601,3602,crystal blue eyes,long legs,routh
3603,3604,strong legs,perfect breasts,routh
3605,3606,how perfect,it makes you awfully hard to hear about lara she said,routh
3607,3608,the breasts he said,she is nineteen,routh
3609,3610,they are solid and they are just up there,her cunt is shaved and there is just a fringe of blond hair to either side,routh
3611,3612,who is fucking her,the boys or the girls,routh
3613,3614,i do not know yet,but somebody is been having some fun down there,routh
3615,3616,from then on lara was with them whenever they wanted her,you are fucking her pegeen would say,routh
3617,3618,that is lara is perfect little pussy,you fucking her too,routh
3619,3620,no,just you,routh
3621,3622,close your eyes,you want her to make you come,routh
3623,3624,you want lara to make you come,all right you blond little bitchmake him come,routh
3625,3626,pegeen cried and no longer did he have to tell her how to ride the horse,squirt it all over her,routh
3627,3628,now,now,routh
3629,3630,yes that is itsquirt in her face,they went to a local inn one night for dinner,routh
3631,3632,from the rustic dining room you could see out over the road to a big lake emblazoned by the sunset,she wore her newest clothes they had gone shopping for them on an impulsive visit to new york the week before a little clinging black jersey skirt a red cashmere sleeveless shell with a red cashmere cardigan knotted over her shoulders sheer black stockings a soft leather shoulder bag trimmed with small leather streamers and on her feet a pair of pointy black slingbacks cut to show the cleavage of the foot,routh
3633,3634,she looked soft and curvaceous and enticing red above and everything black from the waist down and she carried herself with such casual comfort that she might have been dressing like that all her life,she wore the shoulder bag as the saleswoman had suggested with the strap slung across her body like a bandolier and the bag riding her hip,routh
3635,3636,to try to prevent his back from locking and his leg from going dead it was his habit to get up and walk around two or three times during a meal and so after the main course and before dessert axler stood and for the second time strolled through the restaurant and across the inn is public sitting room and into the bar,there he saw an attractive young woman drinking by herself,routh
3637,3638,she must have been in her twenties and from the way she was talking to the bartender he could tell she was a little drunk,he smiled when she looked his way and so as to prolong his stay he asked the bartender if he knew the ball score,routh
3639,3640,then he asked her if she was local or staying at the inn,she said she had just taken a job at the antique shop down the road and had stopped in after work for a drink,routh
3641,3642,he asked if she knew anything about antiques and she said her parents owned an antique shop farther upstate,she had been working at a shop in greenwich village for three years and had decided to get away from the city and try her luck in washington county,routh
3643,3644,he asked how long she had been out here and she said she had arrived only the month before,he asked what she was drinking and when she told him he said next one is on me and indicated to the bartender that he should put the drink on his tab,routh
3645,3646,when dessert arrived he said to pegeen there is a girl at the bar getting drunk,what does she look like,routh
3647,3648,like she can take care of herself,you want to,routh
3649,3650,if you do he said,how old is she,routh
3651,3652,she said,i had say twentyeight,routh
3653,3654,you had be in charge,you and the green cock,routh
3655,3656,you had be in charge she said to him,you and the real cock,routh
3657,3658,we had be in charge together he said,i want to see her she said,routh
3659,3660,he paid the bill and they left the restaurant and went to stand in the doorway of the bar,he stood behind pegeen with his arms encircling her,routh
3661,3662,he could feel her trembling with excitement as she watched the girl drinking at the bar,her trembling thrilled him,routh
3663,3664,it was as though they had merged into one maniacally tempted being,you like her,routh
3665,3666,he whispered,she looks as if she could be quite indecent given half a chance,routh
3667,3668,she looks like she is ready for a life of crime,you want to take her home,routh
3669,3670,she is not lara but she had do,what if she vomits in the car,routh
3671,3672,you think she is about to,she is been at it a long time,routh
3673,3674,when she passes out at the house how do we get rid of her,murder her pegeen said,routh
3675,3676,while still closely holding pegeen in front of him he called across the bar do you need a ride young lady,tracy,routh
3677,3678,do you need a ride tracy,i have got my car tracy replied,routh
3679,3680,are you in any shape to drive it,i can drop you off at home,routh
3681,3682,pegeen was still quivering in his arms,she is a cat he thought before the cat pounces the falcon before it soars from the falconer is wrist,routh
3683,3684,the animal you can controluntil you let it loose,he thought i am providing her tracy the way i give her the clothes,routh
3685,3686,everyone felt emboldened with lara because there was no lara there and so no consequences,this he knew to be different,routh
3687,3688,it dawned on him that he was ceding all the power to pegeen,i can get my husband to pick me up tracy said,routh
3689,3690,he had noticed earlier that she wore no wedding ring,no let us drive you,routh
3691,3692,where do you want to go,tracy mentioned a town twelve miles to the west,routh
3693,3694,the bartender who knew axler lived in the opposite direction went about his job as if he were a deafmute,because of axler is movies practically everyone in the rural town of nine hundred knew who he was though few had any idea that his reputation rested on his lifetime is achievement on the stage,routh
3695,3696,the drunken young woman paid her bill and climbed off the stool and grabbed her jacket to leave,she was taller than he had imagined and larger tooa stray perhaps but no waifa buxom blond with an extensive body and a kind of readymade nordic prettiness,routh
3697,3698,in all a coarser commonplace version of stately louise,he put tracy in the back seat with pegeen and drove them along the dark country roads empty of traffic to his house,routh
3699,3700,it was as though they were abducting her,the swiftness with which pegeen moved did not take him by surprise,routh
3701,3702,she was not constrained by inhibition or fear as she had been when she had gotten her haircut and he was already enthralled merely by what he could hear from the back of the car,in the bedroom at home pegeen emptied onto the bed her plastic bag of implements among them the toylike catoninetails with its very soft thin wisps of black unknotted leather,routh
3703,3704,axler wondered what was going on in tracy is mind,she gets into a car with two people she is never seen before they drive her to a house on a dirt road deep in the country and then she steps out of the car into a threering circus,routh
3705,3706,she may be drunk but she is also young,how oblivious to risk can she be,routh
3707,3708,or do pegeen and i inspire trust,or is risk what tracy is looking for,routh
3709,3710,or is she too drunk to care,he wondered if she had ever done anything like this before,routh
3711,3712,he wondered again why she was doing it now,it did not make sense that this tracy should fall into their laps to do all of the laralike stuff they had been dreaming excitedly about in bed,routh
3713,3714,though what did make sense,his being unable to go out and act on a stage,routh
3715,3716,his having been a psychiatric inpatient,his conducting a love affair with a lesbian whom he had first seen nursing at her mother is breast,routh
3717,3718,when a man gets two women together it is not unusual for one of the women rightly or wrongly feeling neglected to wind up crying in a corner of the room,from how this was going so far it looked as though the one who had wind up crying in the corner would be him,routh
3719,3720,yet as he watched from the far side of the bed he did not feel painfully overlooked,he had let pegeen appoint herself ringmaster and would not participate until summoned,routh
3721,3722,he would watch without interfering,first pegeen stepped into the contraption adjusted and secured the leather straps and affixed the dildo so that it jutted straight out,routh
3723,3724,then she crouched above tracy brushing tracy is lips and nipples with her mouth and fondling her breasts and then she slid down a ways and gently penetrated tracy with the dildo,pegeen did not have to force her open,routh
3725,3726,she did not have to say a wordhe imagined that if either one of them did begin to speak it would be in a language unrecognizable to him,the green cock plunged in and out of the abundant naked body sprawled beneath it slow at first then faster and harder then harder still and all of tracy is curves and hollows moved in unison with it,routh
3727,3728,this was not soft porn,this was no longer two unclothed women caressing and kissing on a bed,routh
3729,3730,there was something primitive about it now this womanonwoman violence as though in the room filled with shadows pegeen were a magical composite of shaman acrobat and animal,it was as if she were wearing a mask on her genitals a weird totem mask that made her into what she was not and was not supposed to be,routh
3731,3732,she could as well have been a crow or a coyote while simultaneously pegeen mike,there was something dangerous about it,routh
3733,3734,his heart thumped with excitementthe god pan looking on from a distance with his spying lascivious gaze,it was english that pegeen spoke when she looked over from where she was now resting on her back beside tracy combing the little black catoninetails through tracy is long hair and with that kidlike smile that showed her two front teeth said to him softly your turn,routh
3735,3736,defile her,she took tracy by one shoulder whispered time to change masters and gently rolled the stranger is large warm body toward his,routh
3737,3738,three children got together he said and decided to put on a play whereupon his performance began,around midnight they drove tracy back to the lot beside the inn where she had left her car,routh
3739,3740,you two do this often,tracy asked from the back seat where she lay encircled by pegeen is arms,routh
3741,3742,no pegeen said,do you,routh
3743,3744,never in my life,so what do you think,routh
3745,3746,asked pegeen,i ca not think,routh
3747,3748,my head is too crammed with everything to think,i feel tripped out,routh
3749,3750,i feel like i have taken drugs,where did you get the bravado for this,routh
3751,3752,pegeen asked her,the booze,routh
3753,3754,your clothes,the way you looked,routh
3755,3756,i thought i have nothing to fear,tell me is he that actor,routh
3757,3758,tracy asked pegeen as though he were not in the car,he is pegeen said,routh
3759,3760,that is what the bartender said,are you an actress,routh
3761,3762,she asked pegeen,off and on pegeen said,routh
3763,3764,it was crazy tracy said,it was pegeen replied the wielder of the catoninetails and connoisseur of the dildo who was herself no dabbler who had indeed carried things to the limit,routh
3765,3766,tracy kissed pegeen passionately when they said goodnight,passionately pegeen returned the kiss and stroked her hair and clutched her breasts and in the parking lot beside the inn where they had all met the two momentarily clung together,routh
3767,3768,then tracy got into her car and before she drove off he heard pegeen tell her see you soon,they drove home with pegeen is hand down in his pants,routh
3769,3770,the smell she said it is on us while axler thought i miscalculatedi did not think it through,he was the god pan no longer,routh
3771,3772,far from it,while pegeen showered he sat downstairs in the kitchen and had a cup of tea as if nothing had happened as if another ordinary night had been passed at home,routh
3773,3774,the tea the cup the saucer the sugar the creamall answered a need for the matteroffact,i want to have a child,routh
3775,3776,he imagined pegeen speaking those words,he imagined her telling him when she came into the kitchen after the shower i want to have a child,routh
3777,3778,he was imagining the least likely thing that might happen which was why he was imagining it he was out to force his foolhardiness back into a domestic container,with whom,routh
3779,3780,he imagined himself asking her,with you,routh
3781,3782,you are the choice of my life,as your family has duly warned you i am closing in on seventy,routh
3783,3784,when the child is ten i will be seventyfive seventysix,by then i may not be your choice,routh
3785,3786,i will be in a wheelchair with this spine of mine if not already dead,forget about my family he imagined her saying,routh
3787,3788,i want you to be the father of my child,are you going to keep this a secret from asa and carol,routh
3789,3790,no,all that is over,routh
3791,3792,you were right,louise did me a favor with that phone call,routh
3793,3794,no more secrecy,they will have to live with things as they are,routh
3795,3796,and where did this desire come from to mother a child,from becoming what i have become for you,routh
3797,3798,he imagined himself saying who could have foreseen this evening taking this turn,not at all he imagined pegeen replying,routh
3799,3800,it is the next step,if we are to continue i want three things,routh
3801,3802,i want you to have back surgery,i want you to resume your career,routh
3803,3804,i want you to impregnate me,you want a lot,routh
3805,3806,who taught me to want a lot,he imagined her saying,routh
3807,3808,that is my proposal for a real life,what more can i offer,routh
3809,3810,back surgery is very tricky,the doctors i have seen say it would do no good in my case,routh
3811,3812,you ca not go on locked up with that pain,you ca not go on hobbling around forever,routh
3813,3814,and my career is trickier still,no he imagined her saying it is a matter of adopting a plan to end the uncertainty,routh
3815,3816,a bold longterm plan,that is all that is required he imagined himself answering,routh
3817,3818,yes,it is time to be bold with yourself,routh
3819,3820,if anything it sounds like it is time to be cautious,but because in her company he had begun to be rejuvenated because he had done everything in his power to get himself to believe that she who had begun by offering him a glass of wateronly to go from there to pulling off the feat of feats the sexchange actcould indeed make contentment real with him he thought the most hopeful thoughts he could,routh
3821,3822,in this kitchen reverie of the rectified life he imagined himself seeing an orthopedist who sent him for an mri and after that for a presurgical myelogram and after that for surgery,meanwhile he would have contacted jerry oppenheim and told him that if anyone wanted to offer him a role he was available to work again,routh
3823,3824,then still at the kitchen table exciting himself by elaborating these thoughts while pegeen finished showering upstairs he imagined pegeen having a healthy baby the very month that he opened at the guthrie theater in the role of james tyrone,he would have found vincent daniels is card where he had left it as a bookmark in the copy of long day is journey,routh
3825,3826,he would have gone to see vincent daniels with the script and they would have worked together every day until they found the way to get him to stop distrusting himself so that when he went onstage at the guthrie on opening night the lost magic returned and he knew while the words were flying so naturally so effortlessly out of his mouth that he was in the midst of a performance as good as any he had ever given and that maybe being incapacitated for so long however painful had not been the worst thing that could have happened,now the audience believed him anew in every moment,routh
3827,3828,where previously confronting the scariest part of actingthe line saying something saying something spontaneously with freedom and easehe had felt himself naked without the protection of any approach now everything was once again emanating from instinct and he needed no other means of approach,the stretch of bad luck was over,routh
3829,3830,the selfinflicted torment was over,he had recovered his confidence the grief was displaced the abominable fear was dispelled and everything that had fled him was back where it belonged,routh
3831,3832,the reconstruction of a life had to begin somewhere and for him it had started with falling for pegeen stapleford amazingly just the woman to have recruited for the job,it seemed to him now that the kitchen scenario was no longer the aery tale with which he had begun but that he was imagining a new possibility a reclamation of exuberance that it was his intention to fight for and to implement and to enjoy,routh
3833,3834,axler felt the determination that was originally his when he came to new york to audition at the age of twentytwo,the next morning as soon as pegeen had left to drive back to vermont he called a hospital in new york and asked for a doctor with whom he could consult about the genetic hazards of fathering a child at sixtyfive,routh
3835,3836,he was referred to the office of a specialist and given an appointment for the following week,he said nothing about any of this to pegeen,routh
3837,3838,the hospital was far uptown and after parking the car in a garage he made his way with mounting excitement to the doctor is office,he was given the usual medical forms to fill out and then greeted by a filipino man of about thirtyfive who said he was dr,routh
3839,3840,wan is assistant,there was a windowed room off the waiting area and the assistant led him there so that they could be alone,routh
3841,3842,it seemed a room designed to be used by children with low tables and small chairs scattered about and children is drawings pinned to one wall,the two of them sat at one of the tables and the assistant began to ask him about himself and his family and the diseases they had suffered from and the diseases they had died of,routh
3843,3844,the doctor is assistant recorded the answers on a sheet of paper printed with the skeleton of a family tree,axler told him as much as he knew from as far back as his knowledge of the family extended,routh
3845,3846,then the assistant took a second sheet and asked about the family of the prospective mother,axler could tell him only that pegeen is parents were both living he knew nothing about their medical histories or those of pegeen is aunts uncles grandparents and greatgrandparents,routh
3847,3848,the assistant asked for her family is country of origin as he had asked for axler is and having recorded the information told axler that he would give all the data to dr,wan and that after he and the doctor had conferred she would come out to talk to axler,routh
3849,3850,alone in the room axler felt ecstatic with the return of his force and his naturalness and the abandonment of his humiliation and the end of his disappearance from the world,this was not reverie any longer the revitalization of simon axler was truly under way,routh
3851,3852,and under way in this room full of children is furniture of all places,the scale of the furniture reminded him of the art therapy session at hammerton when he and sybil van buren had been given crayons and paper in order to draw pictures for their therapist,routh
3853,3854,he remembered how he had obediently set to coloring with the crayons like the child he had once been in kindergarten class,he remembered the mortifying consequences of having ended up in hammerton how every trace of assuredness had vanished he remembered how all he found to deliver him from a pervasive sense of defeat and dread was the conversation that he listened to in the rec room after dinner the stories of those among the hospitalized infatuated still with how they had tried to kill themselves,routh
3855,3856,now however a huge man sitting awkwardly amid these little tables and chairs he was at one with the actor conscious of the achievement behind him and convinced that life could begin again,dr,routh
3857,3858,wan was a small slender young woman who said that she would of course need pegeen is history too but that she could begin at least to address his fears about birth defects in the offspring of aging fathers,she told him that although the ideal age for men to father children is their twenties and although the risk of passing on genetic vulnerability or developmental disorders like autism is significantly increased after forty and although older men had more sperm with damaged dna than younger men the odds of fathering normal offspring without birth defects were not necessarily dire for a man of his age and health especially as some though not all birth defects could be detected during pregnancy,routh
3859,3860,the testicular cells that give rise to sperm divide every sixteen days dr,wan explained to him while they sat across from each other at the little table,routh
3861,3862,this means that the cells have split about eight hundred times by age fifty,and with each cell division the chance increases for errors in the sperm is dna,routh
3863,3864,once pegeen had provided her with the other half of the story she could more fully evaluate their situation and work with them together should they wish to proceed further,she gave him her card along with a pamphlet that spelled out in detail the nature and risk of birth defects,routh
3865,3866,she also explained that there might be decreased fertility at his age and so at his request she provided him with a referral to a laboratory to have a sperm analysis,that way they could determine if there was likely to be any difficulty with conception,routh
3867,3868,there can be a problem she told him of sperm count of motility or morphology,i understand he said and to express an uncontrollable sense of gratitude reached out to clutch her hand,routh
3869,3870,the doctor smiled at him as if she were the older of the two and said call me if you have questions,back at home he had an enormous urge to phone pegeen and tell her of the great idea that had taken hold of him and what he had done about it,routh
3871,3872,but that conversation would have to wait until they were together the following weekend and had hours and hours to talk,alone in bed that night he read the pamphlet dr,routh
3873,3874,wan had given him,it takes healthy sperm to make a healthy baby,routh
3875,3876,about 2 to 3 percent of all babies are born with a major birth defect,more than 20 rare but devastating genetic disorders have been linked to aging fathers,routh
3877,3878,the older a man is when he conceives a child the more likely his partner is to miscarry,older fathers are more likely to have children with autism schizophrenia and down syndrome,routh
3879,3880,he went through the pamphlet once and then again and sobering as he found the information mindful as he now was of the risks he would not be dissuaded from his plans by what he read,instead too excited to sleep thinking something wonderful was happening he found himself down in the living room further enlivened by listening to music and along with feelings of fearlessness such as he had not known for years experiencing the deep biological longing for a child that is more commonly associated with a woman than with a man,routh
3881,3882,nothing about their being together seemed improbable any longer,she had to go with him to see dr,routh
3883,3884,wan,once everyone had the whole story the two of them would soberly assess what should come next,routh
3885,3886,he had planned to begin the conversation after dinner on friday evening,but when pegeen arrived for the weekend late friday afternoon she went off to her study with a slew of student exams to mark and left it to him to make dinner,routh
3887,3888,and after dinner she withdrew again to the study to grade more exams,he thought let her get everything done now,routh
3889,3890,then we will have the weekend to talk,in bed in the darktwo weeks to the day after the tryst with tracywhen he began to kiss and to fondle pegeen she pulled away and said my heart is not in it tonight,routh
3891,3892,all right he said and unable to arouse her rolled over to his side but without relinquishing her hand which he held on to with his own handthe hand that still wanted to touch everythinguntil she had fallen asleep,when he awakened in the middle of the night he wondered what did it mean that her heart was not in it why had she been so unwilling to be near him from the moment she had arrived,routh
3893,3894,he found out first thing the next morning before he even had a chance to begin to tell her about his meeting with dr,wan and all that lay behind that meeting and all that potentially lay ahead of them he found out that in going to see dr,routh
3895,3896,wan he had not so much educated himself in order to avoid doing something rash as to dig himself deeper into an unreal world,this is the end she said to axler at the breakfast table,routh
3897,3898,each was seated across from the other in the very chairs as when she had told him in months gone by that they had already taken the risk,end of what,routh
3899,3900,he asked,of this,routh
3901,3902,but why,it is not what i want,routh
3903,3904,i made a mistake,so began the end as abruptly as that and it concluded some thirty minutes later with pegeen at the front door clutching her full duffle bag and axler in tears,routh
3905,3906,this was the very antithesis of his expectations that night in the kitchen two weeks back,the very antithesis of his expectations when he had gone to see dr,routh
3907,3908,wan,everything he wanted she was preventing him from having,routh
3909,3910,and she was crying now as well it was not as easy to pull off as it had seemed in the first moment at the kitchen table,but still she would not be budged and however much he wept she remained silent,routh
3911,3912,the picture she made at the front door back in her boy is zippered red jacket and holding her duffle bag expressed it all this form of hardship she could endure,she was not about to sit down over a cup of coffee and have a hearttoheart talk that would lead to a rapprochement,routh
3913,3914,she wanted only to be free of him and to satisfy the common enough human wish to move on and try something else,you cannot nullify everything,routh
3915,3916,he shouted angrily and with that pegeen the mightier of the two opened the door,at last she spoke sobbing,routh
3917,3918,i tried to be perfect for you,what the hell does that mean,routh
3919,3920,was it ever a matter of being perfect,hado not pull away from me,routh
3921,3922,i love this and i do not want it to stop,i was idiot enough to believe what you said,routh
3923,3924,i was idiot enough to think you were doing what you wanted to do,it was what i wanted to do,routh
3925,3926,i wanted so much to see if i could do it,so it was an experiment right down to the end,routh
3927,3928,another adventure for pegeen mikelike picking up a pitcher on a softball team,i ca not be a substitute for your acting anymore,routh
3929,3930,oh do not pull that,that is disgusting,routh
3931,3932,but it is true,i am what you have instead of that,routh
3933,3934,i am supposed to make up for that,that is the most ludicrous bullshit i have ever heard,routh
3935,3936,and you know it,go pegeen,routh
3937,3938,if that is your vindication go,we took the risk,routh
3939,3940,i took the risk,you just said whatever you thought i wanted to hear so that you could get what you wanted as long as you wanted it,routh
3941,3942,i did no such thing,she cried,routh
3943,3944,it is tracy is not it,what is,routh
3945,3946,you are dumping me for tracy,i am not simon,routh
3947,3948,no,you are not leaving me because i do not have a job,routh
3949,3950,you are leaving me for that girl,you are going to that girl,routh
3951,3952,where i go is my business,oh just let me go,routh
3953,3954,who is holding you back,not me,routh
3955,3956,never,he pointed at the duffle bag into which she had crammed all the new clothes of hers that had been hanging in his closets and folded in his bureau drawers,routh
3957,3958,pack your sex toys,he asked,routh
3959,3960,remember your harness,she did not answer but the emotion flashing through her was hatred or so he understood the look in her eyes,routh
3961,3962,yes he said take the tools of your trade and go,now your parents can sleep at nightyou are no longer with an old man,routh
3963,3964,now there is no interloper between you and your father,you are unburdened of your impediment,routh
3965,3966,no more admonitions from home,safely returned to your original position,routh
3967,3968,good,go on to the next one,routh
3969,3970,i never had the strength for you anyway,a man is way is laid with a multitude of traps and pegeen had been the last,routh
3971,3972,he had stepped hungrily into it and taken the bait like the most craven captive on earth,there was no other way for it to wind up and yet he was the last to find out,routh
3973,3974,improbable,no predictable,routh
3975,3976,abandoned after so long,clearly not so long for her as for him,routh
3977,3978,everything enchanting about her was gone and in the time it had taken her to say this is the end he was condemned to his hole with the six sticks alone and emptied of the desire to live,she left in her car and the process of collapse took less than five minutes a collapse from a fall brought on himself and from which there was now no recovery,routh
3979,3980,he went up to the attic and sat there for a whole day and well into the night preparing to pull the trigger of his shotgun and intermittently ready to rush down the stairs and wake jerry oppenheim at home ready to call hammerton and speak to his doctor ready to dial 911,and at a dozen different moments throughout the day ready to call lansing and tell asa what a treacherous son of a bitch he was to have turned pegeen against him,routh
3981,3982,that was how it had happened he was sure,pegeen had been right all along to want to keep the news of their affair from her family,routh
3983,3984,because they have known you so long she had explained to him when he had asked why she preferred to keep him a secret,because you are all the same age,routh
3985,3986,had he made the trip to michigan when he first suggested to pegeen his going out there to talk to asa he might perhaps have had a chance to win,but to phone asa now would accomplish nothing,routh
3987,3988,pegeen was gone,gone to tracy,routh
3989,3990,gone to lara,gone to the pitcher with the ponytail,routh
3991,3992,wherever she was he no longer had to worry about the genetic hazards of being an aging father with testicular cells that had already divided well over eight hundred times,by dinnertime he could restrain himself no longer and carrying the gun with him he came down from the attic to the phone,routh
3993,3994,carol answered,it is simon axler,routh
3995,3996,why yes,hello simon,routh
3997,3998,let me speak to asa,his voice was trembling and his heartbeat had quickened,routh
3999,4000,he had to sit in a kitchen chair to continue,it was very like the way he had felt in washington the last time he had tried to go out on a stage to perform,routh
4001,4002,he lay flat on the brown pineneedled floor of the forest his chin on his folded arms and high overhead the wind blewin the tops of the pine trees,the mountain side sloped gently where he lay but belowit was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass,hemingway
4003,4004,there was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he sawa mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam white in the summer sunlight,is that the mill,hemingway
4005,4006,he asked,yes,hemingway
4007,4008,i do not remember it,it was built since you were here,hemingway
4009,4010,the old mill is farther down much belowthe pass,he spread the photostated military map out on the forest floor and looked at it carefully,hemingway
4011,4012,the old man looked over his shoulder,he was a short and solid old man in a black peasants smock and gray ironstiff trousers and he wore ropesoled shoes,hemingway
4013,4014,he was breathing heavily from the climb and his hand rested on one of the two heavy packs they had been carrying,then you cannot see the bridge from here,hemingway
4015,4016,no the old man said,this is the easy country of the pass where the stream flows gently,hemingway
4017,4018,below where the road turns out of sight in the trees it drops suddenly and there is a steep gorge i remember,across this gorge is the bridge,hemingway
4019,4020,and where are their posts,there is a post at the mill that you see there,hemingway
4021,4022,the young man who was studying the country took his glasses from the pocket of his faded khaki flannel shirt wiped the lenses with a handkerchief screwed the eyepieces around until the boards of the mill showed suddenly clearly and he sawthe wooden bench beside the door the huge pile of sawdust that rose behind the open shed where the circular sawwas and a stretch of the flume that brought the logs down from the mountainside on the other bank of the stream,the stream showed clear and smoothlooking in the glasses and belowthe curl of the falling water the spray from the dam was blowing in the wind,hemingway
4023,4024,there is no sentry,there is smoke coming from the millhouse the old man said,hemingway
4025,4026,there are also clothes hanging on a line,i see them but i do not see any sentry,hemingway
4027,4028,perhaps he is in the shade the old man explained,it is hot there now,hemingway
4029,4030,he would be in the shadowat the end we do not see,probably,hemingway
4031,4032,where is the next post,belowthe bridge,hemingway
4033,4034,it is at the roadmenders hut at kilometer five from the top of the pass,howmany men are here,hemingway
4035,4036,he pointed at the mill,perhaps four and a corporal,hemingway
4037,4038,and below,more,hemingway
4039,4040,i will find out,and at the bridge,hemingway
4041,4042,always two,one at each end,hemingway
4043,4044,we will need a certain number of men he said,howmany men can you get,hemingway
4045,4046,i can bring as many men as you wish the old man said,there are many men nowhere in the hills,hemingway
4047,4048,howmany,there are more than a hundred,hemingway
4049,4050,but they are in small bands,howmany men will you need,hemingway
4051,4052,i will let you knowwhen we have studied the bridge,do you wish to study it now,hemingway
4053,4054,no,nowi wish to go to where we will hide this explosive until it is time,hemingway
4055,4056,i would like to have it hidden in utmost security at a distance no greater than half an hour from the bridge if that is possible,that is simple the old man said,hemingway
4057,4058,from where we are going it will all be downhill to the bridge,but nowwe must climb a little in seriousness to get there,hemingway
4059,4060,are you hungry,yes the young man said,hemingway
4061,4062,but we will eat later,howare you called,hemingway
4063,4064,i have forgotten,it was a bad sign to him that he had forgotten,hemingway
4065,4066,anselmo the old man said,i am called anselmo and i come from barco de avila,hemingway
4067,4068,let me help you with that pack,the young man who was tall and thin with sun streaked fair hair and a wind and sunburned face who wore the sunfaded flannel shirt a pair of peasants trousers and ropesoled shoes leaned over put his arm through one of the leather pack straps and swung the heavy pack up onto his shoulders,hemingway
4069,4070,he worked his arm through the other strap and settled the weight of the pack against his back,his shirt was still wet from where the pack had rested,hemingway
4071,4072,i have it up now he said,howdo we go,hemingway
4073,4074,we climb anselmo said,bending under the weight of the packs sweating they climbed steadily in the pine forest that covered the mountainside,hemingway
4075,4076,there was no trail that the young man could see but they were working up and around the face of the mountain and nowthey crossed a small stream and the old man went steadily on ahead up the edge of the rocky stream bed,the climbing nowwas steeper and more difficult until finally the stream seemed to drop down over the edge of a smooth granite ledge that rose above them and the old man waited at the foot of the ledge for the young man to come up to him,hemingway
4077,4078,howare you making it,all right the young man said,hemingway
4079,4080,he was sweating heavily and his thigh muscles were twitchy from the steepness of the climb,wait here nowfor me,hemingway
4081,4082,i go ahead to warn them,you do not want to be shot at carrying that stuff,hemingway
4083,4084,not even in a joke the young man said,is it far,hemingway
4085,4086,it is very close,howdo they call thee,hemingway
4087,4088,roberto the young man answered,he had slipped the pack off and lowered it gently down between two boulders by the stream bed,hemingway
4089,4090,wait here then roberto and i will return for you,good the young man said,hemingway
4091,4092,but do you plan to go down this way to the bridge,no,hemingway
4093,4094,when we go to the bridge it will be by another way,shorter and easier,hemingway
4095,4096,i do not want this material to be stored too far from the bridge,you will see,hemingway
4097,4098,if you are not satisfied we will take another place,we will see the young man said,hemingway
4099,4100,he sat by the packs and watched the old man climb the ledge,it was not hard to climb and from the way he found handholds without searching for them the young man could see that he had climbed it many times before,hemingway
4101,4102,yet whoever was above had been very careful not to leave any trail,the young man whose name was robert jordan was extremely hungry and he was worried,hemingway
4103,4104,he was often hungry but he was not usually worried because he did not give any importance to what happened to himself and he knewfrom experience howsimple it was to move behind the enemy lines in all this country,it was as simple to move behind them as it was to cross through them if you had a good guide,hemingway
4105,4106,it was only giving importance to what happened to you if you were caught that made it difficult that and deciding whom to trust,you had to trust the people you worked with completely or not at all and you had to make decisions about the trusting,hemingway
4107,4108,he was not worried about any of that,but there were other things,hemingway
4109,4110,this anselmo had been a good guide and he could travel wonderfully in the mountains,robert jordan could walk well enough himself and he knewfrom following him since before daylight that the old man could walk him to death,hemingway
4111,4112,robert jordan trusted the man anselmo so far in everything except judgment,he had not yet had an opportunity to test his judgment and anyway the judgment was his own responsibility,hemingway
4113,4114,no he did not worry about anselmo and the problem of the bridge was no more difficult than many other problems,he knewhowto blowany sort of bridge that you could name and he had blown them of all sizes and constructions,hemingway
4115,4116,there was enough explosive and all equipment in the two packs to blowthis bridge properly even if it were twice as big as anselmo reported it as he remembered it when he had walked over it on his way to la granja on a walking trip in 1933 and as golz had read him the description of it night before last in that upstairs room in the house outside of the escorial,to blowthe bridge is nothing golz had said the lamplight on his scarred shaved head pointing with a pencil on the big map,hemingway
4117,4118,you understand,yes i understand,hemingway
4119,4120,absolutely nothing,merely to blowthe bridge is a failure,hemingway
4121,4122,yes comrade general,to blowthe bridge at a stated hour based on the time set for the attack is howit should be done,hemingway
4123,4124,you see that naturally,that is your right and howit should be done,hemingway
4125,4126,golz looked at the pencil then tapped his teeth with it,robert jordan had said nothing,hemingway
4127,4128,you understand that is your right and howit should be done golz went on looking at him and nodding his head,he tapped on the map nowwith the pencil,hemingway
4129,4130,that is howi should do it,that is what we cannot have,hemingway
4131,4132,why comrade general,why,hemingway
4133,4134,golz said angrily,howmany attacks have you seen and you ask me why,hemingway
4135,4136,what is to guarantee that my orders are not changed,what is to guarantee that the attack is not annulled,hemingway
4137,4138,what is to guarantee that the attack is not postponed,what is to guarantee that it starts within six hours of when it should start,hemingway
4139,4140,has any attack ever been as it should,it will start on time if it is your attack robert jordan said,hemingway
4141,4142,they are never my attacks golz said,i make them,hemingway
4143,4144,but they are not mine,the artillery is not mine,hemingway
4145,4146,i must put in for it,i have never been given what i ask for even when they have it to give,hemingway
4147,4148,that is the least of it,there are other things,hemingway
4149,4150,you knowhowthose people are,it is not necessary to go into all of it,hemingway
4151,4152,always there is something,always some one will interfere,hemingway
4153,4154,so nowbe sure you understand,so when is the bridge to be blown,hemingway
4155,4156,robert jordan had asked,after the attack starts,hemingway
4157,4158,as soon as the attack has started and not before,so that no reinforcements will come up over that road,hemingway
4159,4160,he pointed with his pencil,i must knowthat nothing will come up over that road,hemingway
4161,4162,and when is the attack,i will tell you,hemingway
4163,4164,but you are to use the date and hour only as an indication of a probability,you must be ready for that time,hemingway
4165,4166,you will blowthe bridge after the attack has started,you see,hemingway
4167,4168,he indicated with the pencil,that is the only road on which they can bring up reinforcements,hemingway
4169,4170,that is the only road on which they can get up tanks or artillery or even move a truck toward the pass which i attack,i must knowthat bridge is gone,hemingway
4171,4172,not before so it can be repaired if the attack is postponed,no,hemingway
4173,4174,it must go when the attack starts and i must knowit is gone,there are only two sentries,hemingway
4175,4176,the man who will go with you has just come from there,he is a very reliable man they say,hemingway
4177,4178,you will see,he has people in the mountains,hemingway
4179,4180,get as many men as you need,use as fewas possible but use enough,hemingway
4181,4182,i do not have to tell you these things,and howdo i determine that the attack has started,hemingway
4183,4184,it is to be made with a full division,there will be an aerial bombardment as preparation,hemingway
4185,4186,you are not deaf are you,then i may take it that when the planes unload the attack has started,hemingway
4187,4188,you could not always take it like that golz said and shook his head,but in this case you may,hemingway
4189,4190,it is my attack,i understand it robert jordan had said,hemingway
4191,4192,i do not say i like it very much,neither do i like it very much,hemingway
4193,4194,if you do not want to undertake it say so now,if you think you cannot do it say so now,hemingway
4195,4196,i will do it robert jordan had said,i will do it all right,hemingway
4197,4198,that is all i have to know golz said,that nothing comes up over that bridge,hemingway
4199,4200,that is absolute,i understand,hemingway
4201,4202,i do not like to ask people to do such things and in such a way golz went on,i could not order you to do it,hemingway
4203,4204,i understand what you may be forced to do through my putting such conditions,i explain very carefully so that you understand and that you understand all of the possible difficulties and the importance,hemingway
4205,4206,and howwill you advance on la granja if that bridge is blown,we go forward prepared to repair it after we have stormed the pass,hemingway
4207,4208,it is a very complicated and beautiful operation,as complicated and as beautiful as always,hemingway
4209,4210,the plan has been manufactured in madrid,it is another of vicente rojo the unsuccessful professors masterpieces,hemingway
4211,4212,i make the attack and i make it as always not in sufficient force,it is a very possible operation in spite of that,hemingway
4213,4214,i am much happier about it than usual,it can be successful with that bridge eliminated,hemingway
4215,4216,we can take segovia,look i showyou howit goes,hemingway
4217,4218,you see,it is not the top of the pass where we attack,hemingway
4219,4220,we hold that,it is much beyond,hemingway
4221,4222,look here like this i would rather not know robert jordan said,good said golz,hemingway
4223,4224,it is less of baggage to carry with you on the other side yes,i would always rather not know,hemingway
4225,4226,then no matter what can happen it was not me that talked,it is better not to know golz stroked his forehead with the pencil,hemingway
4227,4228,many times i wish i did not knowmyself,but you do knowthe one thing you must knowabout the bridge,hemingway
4229,4230,yes,i knowthat,hemingway
4231,4232,i believe you do golz said,i will not make you any little speech,hemingway
4233,4234,let us nowhave a drink,so much talking makes me very thirsty comrade hordan,hemingway
4235,4236,you have a funny name in spanish comrade hordown,howdo you say golz in spanish comrade general,hemingway
4237,4238,hotze said golz grinning making the sound deep in his throat as though hawking with a bad cold,hotze he croaked,hemingway
4239,4240,comrade heneral khotze,if i had known howthey pronounced golz in spanish i would pick me out a better name before i come to war here,hemingway
4241,4242,when i think i come to command a division and i can pick out any name i want and i pick out hotze,heneral hotze,hemingway
4243,4244,nowit is too late to change,howdo you like partizan work,hemingway
4245,4246,it was the russian term for guerilla work behind the lines,very much robert jordan said,hemingway
4247,4248,he grinned,it is very healthy in the open air,hemingway
4249,4250,i like it very much when i was your age too golz said,they tell me you blowbridges very well,hemingway
4251,4252,very scientific,it is only hearsay,hemingway
4253,4254,i have never seen you do anything myself,maybe nothing ever happens really,hemingway
4255,4256,you really blowthem,he was teasing now,hemingway
4257,4258,drink this he handed the glass of spanish brandy to robert jordan,you really blowthem,hemingway
4259,4260,sometimes,youbetter not have any sometimes onthis bridge,hemingway
4261,4262,no let us not talk any more about this bridge,you understand enough nowabout that bridge,hemingway
4263,4264,we are very serious so we can make very strong jokes,look do you have many girls on the other side of the lines,hemingway
4265,4266,no there is no time for girls,i do not agree,hemingway
4267,4268,the more irregular the service the more irregular the life,you have very irregular service,hemingway
4269,4270,also you need a haircut,i have my hair cut as it needs it robert jordan said,hemingway
4271,4272,he would be damned if he would have his head shaved like golz,i have enough to think about without girls he said sullenly,hemingway
4273,4274,what sort of uniform am i supposed to wear,robert jordan asked,hemingway
4275,4276,none golz said,your haircut is all right,hemingway
4277,4278,i tease you,you are very different from me golz had said and filled up the glasses again,hemingway
4279,4280,you never think about only girls,i never think at all,hemingway
4281,4282,why should i,i am general sovietique,hemingway
4283,4284,i never think,do not try to trap me into thinking,hemingway
4285,4286,some one on his staff sitting on a chair working over a map on a drawing board growled at him in the language robert jordan did not understand,shut up golz had said in english,hemingway
4287,4288,i joke if i want,i am so serious is why i can joke,hemingway
4289,4290,nowdrink this and then go,you understand huh,hemingway
4291,4292,yes robert jordan had said,i understand,hemingway
4293,4294,they had shaken hands and he had saluted and gone out to the staff car where the old man was waiting asleep and in that car they had ridden over the road past guadarrama the old man still asleep and up the navacerrada road to the alpine club hut where he robert jordan slept for three hours before they started,that was the last he had seen of golz with his strange white face that never tanned his hawk eyes the big nose and thin lips and the shaven head crossed with wrinkles and with scars,hemingway
4295,4296,tomorrownight they would be outside the escorial in the dark along the road the long lines of trucks loading the infantry in the darkness the men heavy loaded climbing up into the trucks the machinegun sections lifting their guns into the trucks the tanks being run up on the skids onto the longbodied tank trucks pulling the division out to move them in the night for the attack on the pass,he would not think about that,hemingway
4297,4298,that was not his business,that was golzs business,hemingway
4299,4300,he had only one thing to do and that was what he should think about and he must think it out clearly and take everything as it came along and not worry,to worry was as bad as to be afraid,hemingway
4301,4302,it simply made things more difficult,he sat nowby the stream watching the clear water flowing between the rocks and across the stream he noticed there was a thick bed of watercress,hemingway
4303,4304,he crossed the stream picked a double handful washed the muddy roots clean in the current and then sat down again beside his pack and ate the clean cool green leaves and the crisp pepperytasting stalks,he knelt by the stream and pushing his automatic pistol around on his belt to the small of his back so that it would not be wet he lowered himself with a hand on each of two boulders and drank from the stream,hemingway
4305,4306,the water was achingly cold,pushing himself up on his hands he turned his head and sawthe old man coming down the ledge,hemingway
4307,4308,with him was another man also in a black peasants smock and the dark gray trousers that were almost a uniform in that province wearing ropesoled shoes and with a carbine slung over his back,this man was bareheaded,hemingway
4309,4310,the two of them came scrambling down the rock like goats,they came up to him and robert jordan got to his feet,hemingway
4311,4312,salud camarada he said to the man with the carbine and smiled,salud the other said grudgingly,hemingway
4313,4314,robert jordan looked at the mans heavy beardstubbled face,it was almost round and his head was round and set close on his shoulders,hemingway
4315,4316,his eyes were small and set too wide apart and his ears were small and set close to his head,he was a heavy man about five feet ten inches tall and his hands and feet were large,hemingway
4317,4318,his nose had been broken and his mouth was cut at one corner and the line of the scar across the upper lip and lower jawshowed through the growth of beard over his face,the old man nodded his head at this man and smiled,hemingway
4319,4320,he is the boss here he grinned then flexed his arms as though to make the muscles stand out and looked at the man with the carbine in a half mocking admiration,a very strong man,hemingway
4321,4322,i can see it robert jordan said and smiled again,he did not like the look of this man and inside himself he was not smiling at all,hemingway
4323,4324,what have you to justify your identity,asked the man with the carbine,hemingway
4325,4326,robert jordan unpinned a safety pin that ran through his pocket flap and took a folded paper out of the left breast pocket of his flannel shirt and handed it to the man who opened it looked at it doubtfully and turned it in his hands,so he cannot read robert jordan noted,hemingway
4327,4328,look at the seal he said,the old man pointed to the seal and the man with the carbine studied it turning it in his fingers,hemingway
4329,4330,what seal is that,have you never seen it,hemingway
4331,4332,no,there are two said robert jordan,hemingway
4333,4334,one is sim,the service of the military intelligence,hemingway
4335,4336,the other is the general staff,yes i have seen that seal before,hemingway
4337,4338,but here no one commands but me the other said sullenly,what have you in the packs,hemingway
4339,4340,dynamite the old man said proudly,last night we crossed the lines in the dark and all day we have carried this dynamite over the mountain,hemingway
4341,4342,i can use dynamite said the man with the carbine,he handed back the paper to robert jordan and looked him over,hemingway
4343,4344,yes,i have use for dynamite,hemingway
4345,4346,howmuch have you brought me,i have brought you no dynamite robert jordan said to him evenly,hemingway
4347,4348,the dynamite is for another purpose,what is your name,hemingway
4349,4350,what is that to you,he is pablo said the old man,hemingway
4351,4352,the man with the carbine looked at them both sullenly,good,hemingway
4353,4354,i have heard much good of you said robert jordan,what have you heard of me,hemingway
4355,4356,asked pablo,i have heard that you are an excellent guerilla leader that you are loyal to the republic and prove your loyalty through your acts and that you are a man both serious and valiant,hemingway
4357,4358,i bring you greetings from the general staff,where did you hear all this,hemingway
4359,4360,asked pablo,robert jordan registered that he was not taking any of the flattery,hemingway
4361,4362,i heard it from buitrago to the escorial he said naming all the stretch of country on the other side of the lines,i knowno one in buitrago nor in escorial pablo told him,hemingway
4363,4364,there are many people on the other side of the mountains who were not there before,where are you from,hemingway
4365,4366,avila,what are you going to do with the dynamite,hemingway
4367,4368,blowup a bridge,what bridge,hemingway
4369,4370,that is my business,if it is in this territory it is my business,hemingway
4371,4372,you cannot blowbridges close to where you live,you must live in one place and operate in another,hemingway
4373,4374,i knowmy business,one who is alive now after a year knows his business,hemingway
4375,4376,this is my business robert jordan said,we can discuss it together,hemingway
4377,4378,do you wish to help us with the sacks,no said pablo and shook his head,hemingway
4379,4380,the old man turned toward him suddenly and spoke rapidly and furiously in a dialect that robert jordan could just follow,it was like reading quevedo,hemingway
4381,4382,anselmo was speaking old castilian and it went something like this art thou a brute,yes,hemingway
4383,4384,art thou a beast,yes many times hast thou a brain,hemingway
4385,4386,nay,none,hemingway
4387,4388,now we come for something of consummate importance and thee with thy dwelling place to be undisturbed puts thy foxhole before the interests of humanity,before the interests of thy people,hemingway
4389,4390,i this and that in the this and that of thy father,i this and that and that in thy this,hemingway
4391,4392,pick up that bag,pablo looked down,hemingway
4393,4394,every one has to do what he can do according to howit can be truly done he said,i live here and i operate beyond segovia,hemingway
4395,4396,if you make a disturbance here we will be hunted out of these mountains,it is only by doing nothing here that we are able to live in these mountains,hemingway
4397,4398,it is the principle of the fox,yes said anselmo bitterly,hemingway
4399,4400,it is the principle of the fox when we need the wolf,i am more wolf than thee pablo said and robert jordan knewthat he would pick up the sack,hemingway
4401,4402,hi,ho,hemingway
4403,4404,anselmo looked at him,thou art more wolf than me and i am sixtyeight years old,hemingway
4405,4406,he spat on the ground and shook his head,you have that many years,hemingway
4407,4408,robert jordan asked seeing that now for the moment it would be all right and trying to make it go easier,sixtyeight in the month of july,hemingway
4409,4410,if we should ever see that month said pablo,let me help you with the pack he said to robert jordan,hemingway
4411,4412,leave the other to the old man,he spoke not sullenly but almost sadly now,hemingway
4413,4414,he isan old man of great strength,i will carry the pack robert jordan said,hemingway
4415,4416,nay said the old man,leave it to this other strong man,hemingway
4417,4418,i will take it pablo told him and in his sullenness there was a sadness that was disturbing to robert jordan,he knewthat sadness and to see it here worried him,hemingway
4419,4420,give me the carbine then he said and when pablo handed it to him he slung it over his back and with the two men climbing ahead of him they went heavily pulling and climbing up the granite shelf and over its upper edge to where there was a green clearing in the forest,they skirted the edge of the little meadowand robert jordan striding easily nowwithout the pack the carbine pleasantly rigid over his shoulder after the heavy sweating pack weight noticed that the grass was cropped down in several places and signs that picket pins had been driven into the earth,hemingway
4421,4422,he could see a trail through the grass where horses had been led to the stream to drink and there was the fresh manure of several horses,they picket them here to feed at night and keep them out of sight in the timber in the daytime he thought,hemingway
4423,4424,i wonder howmany horses this pablo has,he remembered nownoticing without realizing it that pablos trousers were worn soapy shiny in the knees and thighs,hemingway
4425,4426,i wonder if he has a pair of boots or if he rides in those alpargatas he thought,he must have quite an outfit,hemingway
4427,4428,but i do not like that sadness he thought,that sadness is bad,hemingway
4429,4430,that is the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray,that is the sadness that comes before the sellout,hemingway
4431,4432,ahead of them a horse whinnied in the timber and then through the brown trunks of the pine trees only a little sunlight coming down through their thick almosttouching tops he sawthe corral made by roping around the tree trunks,the horses had their heads pointed toward the men as they approached and at the foot of a tree outside the corral the saddles were piled together and covered with a tarpaulin,hemingway
4433,4434,as they came up the two men with the packs stopped and robert jordan knewit was for him to admire the horses,yes he said,hemingway
4435,4436,they are beautiful,he turned to pablo,hemingway
4437,4438,you have your cavalry and all,there were five horses in the rope corral three bays a sorrel and a buckskin,hemingway
4439,4440,sorting them out carefully with his eyes after he had seen them first together robert jordan looked them over individually,pablo and anselmo knewhowgood they were and while pablo stood nowproud and less sad looking watching them lovingly the old man acted as though they were some great surprise that he had produced suddenly himself,hemingway
4441,4442,howdo they look to you,he asked,hemingway
4443,4444,all these i have taken pablo said and robert jordan was pleased to hear him speak proudly,that said robert jordan pointing to one of the bays a big stallion with a white blaze on his forehead and a single white foot the near front is much horse,hemingway
4445,4446,he was a beautiful horse that looked as though he had come out of a painting by velasquez,they are all good said pablo,hemingway
4447,4448,you knowhorses,yes,hemingway
4449,4450,less bad said pablo,do you see a defect in one of these,hemingway
4451,4452,robert jordan knewthat nowhis papers were being examined by the man who could not read,the horses all still had their heads up looking at the man,hemingway
4453,4454,robert jordan slipped through between the double rope of the corral and slapped the buckskin on the haunch,he leaned back against the ropes of the enclosure and watched the horses circle the corral stood watching them a minute more as they stood still then leaned down and came out through the ropes,hemingway
4455,4456,the sorrel is lame in the off hind foot he said to pablo not looking at him,the hoof is split and although it might not get worse soon if shod properly she could break down if she travels over much hard ground,hemingway
4457,4458,the hoof was like that when we took her pablo said,the best horse that you have the whitefaced bay stallion has a swelling on the upper part of the cannon bone that i do not like,hemingway
4459,4460,it is nothing said pablo,he knocked it three days ago,hemingway
4461,4462,if it were to be anything it would have become so already,he pulled back the tarpaulin and showed the saddles,hemingway
4463,4464,there were two ordinary vaqueros or herdsmans saddles like american stock saddles one very ornate vaqueros saddle with handtooled leather and heavy hooded stirrups and two military saddles in black leather,we killed a pair of guardia civil he said explaining the military saddles,hemingway
4465,4466,that is big game,they had dismounted on the road between segovia and santa maria del real,hemingway
4467,4468,they had dismounted to ask papers of the driver of a cart,we were able to kill them without injuring the horses,hemingway
4469,4470,have you killed many civil guards,robert jordan asked,hemingway
4471,4472,several pablo said,but only these two without injury to the horses,hemingway
4473,4474,it was pablo who blewup the train at arevalo anselmo said,that was pablo,hemingway
4475,4476,there was a foreigner with us who made the explosion pablo said,do you knowhim,hemingway
4477,4478,what is he called,i do not remember,hemingway
4479,4480,it was a very rare name,what did he look like,hemingway
4481,4482,he was fair as you are but not as tall and with large hands and a broken nose,kashkin robert jordan said,hemingway
4483,4484,that would be kashkin,yes said pablo,hemingway
4485,4486,it was a very rare name,something like that,hemingway
4487,4488,what has become of him,he is dead since april,hemingway
4489,4490,that is what happens to everybody pablo said gloomily,that is the way we will all finish,hemingway
4491,4492,that is the way all men end anselmo said,that is the way men have always ended,hemingway
4493,4494,what is the matter with you man,what hast thou in the stomach,hemingway
4495,4496,they are very strong pablo said,it was as though he were talking to himself,hemingway
4497,4498,he looked at the horses gloomily,you do not realize howstrong they are,hemingway
4499,4500,i see them always stronget always better armed,always with more material,hemingway
4501,4502,here am i with horses like these,and what can i look forward to,hemingway
4503,4504,to be hunted and to die,nothing more,hemingway
4505,4506,you hunt as much as you are hunted anselmo said,no said pablo,hemingway
4507,4508,not any more,and if we leave these mountains now where can we go,hemingway
4509,4510,answer me that,where now,hemingway
4511,4512,in spain there are many mountains,there are the sierra de gredos if one leaves here,hemingway
4513,4514,not for me pablo said,i am tired of being hunted,hemingway
4515,4516,here we are all right,nowif you blowa bridge here we will be hunted,hemingway
4517,4518,if they knowwe are here and hunt for us with planes they will find us,if they send moors to hunt us out they will find us and we must go,hemingway
4519,4520,i am tired of all this,you hear,hemingway
4521,4522,he turned to robert jordan,what right have you a foreigner to come to me and tell me what i must do,hemingway
4523,4524,i have not told you anything you must do robert jordan said to him,you will though pablo said,hemingway
4525,4526,there,there is the badness,hemingway
4527,4528,he pointed at the two heavy packs that they had lowered to the ground while they had watched the horses,seeing the horses had seemed to bring this all to a head in him and seeing that robert jordan knewhorses had seemed to loosen his tongue,hemingway
4529,4530,the three of them stood nowby the rope corral and the patchy sunlight shone on the coat of the bay stallion,pablo looked at him and then pushed with his foot against the heavy pack,hemingway
4531,4532,there is the badness,i come only for my duty robert jordan told him,hemingway
4533,4534,i come under orders from those who are conducting the war,if i ask you to help me you can refuse and i will find others who will help me,hemingway
4535,4536,i have not even asked you for help yet,i have to do what i am ordered to do and i can promise you of its importance,hemingway
4537,4538,that i am a foreigner is not my fault,i would rather have been born here,hemingway
4539,4540,to me now the most important is that we be not disturbed here pablo said,to me now my duty is to those who are with me and to myself,hemingway
4541,4542,thyself,yes anselmo said,hemingway
4543,4544,thyself nowsince a long time,thyself and thy horses,hemingway
4545,4546,until thou hadst horses thou wert with us,nowthou art another capitalist more,hemingway
4547,4548,that is unjust said pablo,i expose the horses all the time for the cause,hemingway
4549,4550,very little said anselmo scornfully,very little in my judgment,hemingway
4551,4552,to steal yes,to eat well yes,hemingway
4553,4554,to murder yes,to fight no,hemingway
4555,4556,you are an old man who will make himself trouble with his mouth,i am an old man who is afraid of no one anselmo told him,hemingway
4557,4558,also i am an old man without horses,you are an old man who may not live long,hemingway
4559,4560,i am an old man who will live until i die anselmo said,and i am not afraid of foxes,hemingway
4561,4562,pablo said nothing but picked up the pack,nor of wolves either anselmo said picking up the other pack,hemingway
4563,4564,if thou art a wolf,shut thy mouth pablo said to him,hemingway
4565,4566,thou art an old man who always talks too much,and would do whatever he said he would do anselmo said bent under the pack,hemingway
4567,4568,and who nowis hungry,and thirsty,hemingway
4569,4570,go on guerilla leader with the sad face,lead us to something to eat,hemingway
4571,4572,it is starting badly enough robert jordan thought,but anselmos a man,hemingway
4573,4574,they are wonderful when they are good he thought,there is no people like them when they are good and when they go bad there is no people that is worse,hemingway
4575,4576,anselmo must have known what he was doing when he brought us here,but i do not like it,hemingway
4577,4578,i do not like any of it,the only good sign was that pablo was carrying the pack and that he had given him the carbine,hemingway
4579,4580,perhaps he is always like that robert jordan thought,maybe he is just one of the gloomy ones,hemingway
4581,4582,no he said to himself do not fool yourself,you do not knowhowhe was before but you do knowthat he is going bad fast and without hiding it,hemingway
4583,4584,when he starts to hide it he will have made a decision,remember that he told himself,hemingway
4585,4586,the first friendly thing he does he will have made a decision,they are awfully good horses though he thought beautiful horses,hemingway
4587,4588,i wonder what could make me feel the way those horses make pablo feel,the old man was right,hemingway
4589,4590,the horses made him rich and as soon as he was rich he wanted to enjoy life,pretty soon he will feel bad because he can not join the jockey club i guess he thought,hemingway
4591,4592,pauvre pablo,il a manque son jockey,hemingway
4593,4594,that idea made him feel better,he grinned looking at the two bent backs and the big packs ahead of him moving through the trees,hemingway
4595,4596,he had not made any jokes with himself all day and nowthat he had made one he felt much better,you are getting to be as all the rest of them he told himself,hemingway
4597,4598,you are getting gloomy too,he had certainly been solemn and gloomy with golz,hemingway
4599,4600,the job had overwhelmed him a little,slightly overwhelmed he thought,hemingway
4601,4602,plenty overwhelmed,golz was gay and he had wanted him to be gay too before he left but he had not been,hemingway
4603,4604,all the best ones when you thought it over were gay,it was much better to be gay and it was a sign of something too,hemingway
4605,4606,it was like having immortality while you were still alive,that was a complicated one,hemingway
4607,4608,there were not many of them left though,no there were not many of the gay ones left,hemingway
4609,4610,there were very damned fewof them left,and if you keep on thinking like that my boy you will not be left either,hemingway
4611,4612,turn off the thinking now old timer old comrade,you are a bridgeblower now,hemingway
4613,4614,not a thinker,man i am hungry he thought,hemingway
4615,4616,i hope pablo eats well,they had come through the heavy timber to the cupshaped upper end of the little valley and he saw where the camp must be under the rimrock that rose ahead of them through the trees,hemingway
4617,4618,that was the camp all right and it was a good camp,you did not see it at all until you were up to it and robert jordan knewit could not be spotted from the air,hemingway
4619,4620,nothing would showfrom above,it was as well hidden as a bears den,hemingway
4621,4622,but it seemed to be little better guarded,he looked at it carefully as they came up,hemingway
4623,4624,there was a large cave in the rimrock formation and beside the opening a man sat with his back against the rock his legs stretched out on the ground and his carbine leaning against the rock,he was cutting away on a stick with a knife and he stared at them as they came up then went on whittling,hemingway
4625,4626,hola said the seated man,what is this that comes,hemingway
4627,4628,the old man and a dynamiter pablo told him and lowered the pack inside the entrance to the cave,anselmo lowered his pack too and robert jordan unslung the rifle and leaned it against the rock,hemingway
4629,4630,do not leave it so close to the cave the whittling man who had blue eyes in a dark goodlooking lazy gypsy face the color of smoked leather said,theres a fire in there,hemingway
4631,4632,get up and put it away thyself pablo said,put it by that tree,hemingway
4633,4634,the gypsy did not move but said something unprintable then leave it there,blowthyself up he said lazily,hemingway
4635,4636,twill cure thy diseases,what do you make,hemingway
4637,4638,robert jordan sat down by the gypsy,the gypsy showed him,hemingway
4639,4640,it was a figure four trap and he was whittling the crossbar for it,for foxes he said,hemingway
4641,4642,with a log for a deadfall,it breaks their backs,hemingway
4643,4644,he grinned at jordan,like this see,hemingway
4645,4646,he made a motion of the framework of the trap collapsing the log falling then shook his head drewin his hand and spread his arms to showthe fox with a broken back,very practical he explained,hemingway
4647,4648,he catches rabbits anselmo said,he is a gypsy,hemingway
4649,4650,so if he catches rabbits he says it is foxes,if he catches a fox he would say it was an elephant,hemingway
4651,4652,and if i catch an elephant,the gypsy asked and showed his white teeth again and winked at robert jordan,hemingway
4653,4654,youd say it was a tank anselmo told him,i will get a tank the gypsy told him,hemingway
4655,4656,i will get a tank,and you can say it is what you please,hemingway
4657,4658,gypsies talk much and kill little anselmo told him,the gypsy winked at robert jordan and went on whittling,hemingway
4659,4660,pablo had gone in out of sight in the cave,robert jordan hoped he had gone for food,hemingway
4661,4662,he sat on the ground by the gypsy and the afternoon sunlight came down through the tree tops and was warm on his outstretched legs,he could smell food nowin the cave the smell of oil and of onions and of meat frying and his stomach moved with hunger inside of him,hemingway
4663,4664,we can get a tank he said to the gypsy,it is not too difficult,hemingway
4665,4666,with this,the gypsy pointed toward the two sacks,hemingway
4667,4668,yes robert jordan told him,i will teach you,hemingway
4669,4670,you make a trap,it is not too difficult,hemingway
4671,4672,you and me,sure said robert jordan,hemingway
4673,4674,why not,hey the gypsy said to anselmo,hemingway
4675,4676,move those two sacks to where they will be safe will you,theyre valuable,hemingway
4677,4678,anselmo grunted,i am going for wine he told robert jordan,hemingway
4679,4680,robert jordan got up and lifted the sacks away from the cave entrance and leaned them one on each side of a tree trunk,he knewwhat was in them and he never liked to see them close together,hemingway
4681,4682,bring a cup for me the gypsy told him,is there wine,hemingway
4683,4684,robert jordan asked sitting down again by the gypsy,wine,hemingway
4685,4686,why not,a whole skinful,hemingway
4687,4688,half a skinful anyway,and what to eat,hemingway
4689,4690,everything man the gypsy said,we eat like generals,hemingway
4691,4692,and what do gypsies do in the war,robert jordan asked him,hemingway
4693,4694,they keep on being gypsies,that is a good job,hemingway
4695,4696,the best the gypsy said,howdo they call thee,hemingway
4697,4698,roberto,and thee,hemingway
4699,4700,rafael,and this of the tank is serious,hemingway
4701,4702,surely,why not,hemingway
4703,4704,anselmo came out of the mouth of the cave with a deep stone basin full of red wine and with his fingers through the handles of three cups,look he said,hemingway
4705,4706,they have cups and all,pablo came out behind them,hemingway
4707,4708,there is food soon he said,do you have tobacco,hemingway
4709,4710,robert jordan went over to the packs and opening one felt inside an inner pocket and brought out one of the flat boxes of russian cigarettes he had gotten at golzs headquarters,he ran his thumbnail around the edge of the box and opening the lid handed them to pablo who took half a dozen,hemingway
4711,4712,pablo holding them in one of his huge hands picked one up and looked at it against the light,they were long narrowcigarettes with pasteboard cylinders for mouthpieces,hemingway
4713,4714,much air and little tobacco he said,i knowthese,hemingway
4715,4716,the other with the rare name had them,kashkin robert jordan said and offered the cigarettes to the gypsy and anselmo who each took one,hemingway
4717,4718,take more he said and they each took another,he gave them each four more they making a double nod with the hand holding the cigarettes so that the cigarette dipped its end as a man salutes with a sword to thank him,hemingway
4719,4720,yes pablo said,it was a rare name,hemingway
4721,4722,here is the wine,anselmo dipped a cup out of the bowl and handed it to robert jordan then dipped for himself and the gypsy,hemingway
4723,4724,is there no wine for me,pablo asked,hemingway
4725,4726,they were all sitting together by the cave entrance,anselmo handed him his cup and went into the cave for another,hemingway
4727,4728,coming out he leaned over the bowl and dipped the cup full and they all touched cup edges,the wine was good tasting faintly resinous from the wineskin but excellent light and clean on his tongue,hemingway
4729,4730,robert jordan drank it slowly feeling it spread warmly through his tiredness,the food comes shortly pablo said,hemingway
4731,4732,and this foreigner with the rare name howdid he die,he was captured and he killed himself,hemingway
4733,4734,howdid that happen,he was wounded and he did not wish to be a prisoner,hemingway
4735,4736,what were the details,i do not know he lied,hemingway
4737,4738,he knewthe details very well and he knewthey would not make good talking now,he made us promise to shoot him in case he were wounded at the business of the train and should be unable to get away pablo said,hemingway
4739,4740,he spoke in a very rare manner,he must have been jumpy even then robert jordan thought,hemingway
4741,4742,poor old kashkin,he had a prejudice against killing himself pablo said,hemingway
4743,4744,he told me that,also he had a great fear of being tortured,hemingway
4745,4746,did he tell you that too,robert jordan asked him,hemingway
4747,4748,yes the gypsy said,he spoke like that to all of us,hemingway
4749,4750,were you at the train too,yes,hemingway
4751,4752,all of us were at the train,he spoke in a very rare manner pablo said,hemingway
4753,4754,but he was very brave,poor old kashkin robert jordan thought,hemingway
4755,4756,he must have been doing more harm than good around here,i wish i would have known he was that jumpy as far back as then,hemingway
4757,4758,they should have pulled him out,you can not have people around doing this sort of work and talking like that,hemingway
4759,4760,that is no way to talk,even if they accomplish their mission they are doing more harm than good talking that sort of stuff,hemingway
4761,4762,he was a little strange robert jordan said,i think he was a little crazy,hemingway
4763,4764,but very dexterous at producing explosions the gypsy said,and very brave,hemingway
4765,4766,but crazy robert jordan said,in this you have to have very much head and be very cold in the head,hemingway
4767,4768,that was no way to talk,and you pablo said,hemingway
4769,4770,if you are wounded in such a thing as this bridge you would be willing to be left behind,listen robert jordan said and leaning forward he dipped himself another cup of the wine,hemingway
4771,4772,listen to me clearly,if ever i should have any little favors to ask of any man i will ask him at the time,hemingway
4773,4774,good said the gypsy approvingly,in this way speak the good ones,hemingway
4775,4776,ah,here it comes,hemingway
4777,4778,you have eaten said pablo,and i can eat twice more the gypsy told him,hemingway
4779,4780,look nowwho brings it,the girl stooped as she came out of the cave mouth carrying the big iron cooking platter and robert jordan sawher face turned at an angle and at the same time sawthe strange thing about her,hemingway
4781,4782,she smiled and said hola comrade and robert jordan said salud and was careful not to stare and not to look away,she set down the flat iron platter in front of him and he noticed her handsome brown hands,hemingway
4783,4784,nowshe looked him full in the face and smiled,her teeth were white in her brown face and her skin and her eyes were the same golden tawny brown,hemingway
4785,4786,she had high cheekbones merry eyes and a straight mouth with full lips,her hair was the golden brown of a grain field that has been burned dark in the sun but it was cut short all over her head so that it was but little longer than the fur on a beaver pelt,hemingway
4787,4788,she smiled in robert jordans face and put her brown hand up and ran it over her head flattening the hair which rose again as her hand passed,she has a beautiful face robert jordan thought,hemingway
4789,4790,she had be beautiful if they had not cropped her hair,that is the way i comb it she said to robert jordan and laughed,hemingway
4791,4792,go ahead and eat,do not stare at me,hemingway
4793,4794,they gave me this haircut in valladolid,its almost grown out now,hemingway
4795,4796,she sat down opposite him and looked at him,he looked back at her and she smiled and folded her hands together over her knees,hemingway
4797,4798,her legs slanted long and clean from the open cuffs of the trousers as she sat with her hands across her knees and he could see the shape of her small uptilted breasts under the gray shirt,every time robert jordan looked at her he could feel a thickness in his throat,hemingway
4799,4800,there are no plates anselmo said,use your own knife,hemingway
4801,4802,the girl had leaned four forks tines down against the sides of the iron dish,they were all eating out of the platter not speaking as is the spanish custom,hemingway
4803,4804,it was rabbit cooked with onions and green peppers and there were chick peas in the red wine sauce,it was well cooked the rabbit meat flaked off the bones and the sauce was delicious,hemingway
4805,4806,robert jordan drank another cup of wine while he ate,the girl watched him all through the meal,hemingway
4807,4808,every one else was watching his food and eating,robert jordan wiped up the last of the sauce in front of him with a piece of bread piled the rabbit bones to one side wiped the spot where they had been for sauce then wiped his fork clean with the bread wiped his knife and put it away and ate the bread,hemingway
4809,4810,he leaned over and dipped his cup full of wine and the girl still watched him,robert jordan drank half the cup of wine but the thickness still came in his throat when he spoke to the girl,hemingway
4811,4812,howart thou called,he asked,hemingway
4813,4814,pablo looked at him quickly when he heard the tone of his voice,then he got up and walked away,hemingway
4815,4816,maria,and thee,hemingway
4817,4818,roberto,have you been long in the mountains,hemingway
4819,4820,three months,three months,hemingway
4821,4822,he looked at her hair that was as thick and short and rippling when she passed her hand over it nowin embarrassment as a grain field in the wind on a hillside,it was shaved she said,hemingway
4823,4824,they shaved it regularly in the prison at valladolid,it has taken three months to growto this,hemingway
4825,4826,i was on the train,they were taking me to the south,hemingway
4827,4828,many of the prisoners were caught after the train was blown up but i was not,i came with these,hemingway
4829,4830,i found her hidden in the rocks the gypsy said,it was when we were leaving,hemingway
4831,4832,man but this one was ugly,we took her along but many times i thought we would have to leave her,hemingway
4833,4834,and the other one who was with them at the train,asked maria,hemingway
4835,4836,the other blond one,the foreigner,hemingway
4837,4838,where is he,dead robert jordan said,hemingway
4839,4840,in april,in april,hemingway
4841,4842,the train was in april,yes robert jordan said,hemingway
4843,4844,he died ten days after the train,poor man she said,hemingway
4845,4846,he was very brave,and you do that same business,hemingway
4847,4848,yes,you have done trains too,hemingway
4849,4850,yes,three trains,hemingway
4851,4852,here,in estremadura he said,hemingway
4853,4854,i was in estremadura before i came here,we do very much in estremadura,hemingway
4855,4856,there are many of us working in estremadura,and why do you come to these mountains now,hemingway
4857,4858,i take the place of the other blond one,also i knowthis country from before the movement,hemingway
4859,4860,you knowit well,no not really well,hemingway
4861,4862,but i learn fast,i have a good map and i have a good guide,hemingway
4863,4864,the old man she nodded,the old man is very good,hemingway
4865,4866,thank you anselmo said to her and robert jordan realized suddenly that he and the girl were not alone and he realized too that it was hard for him to look at her because it made his voice change so,he was violating the second rule of the two rules for getting on well with people that speak spanish give the men tobacco and leave the women alone and he realized very suddenly that he did not care,hemingway
4867,4868,there were so many things that he had not to care about why should he care about that,you have a very beautiful face he said to maria,hemingway
4869,4870,i wish i would have had the luck to see you before your hair was cut,it will growout she said,hemingway
4871,4872,in six months it will be long enough,you should have seen her when we brought her from the train,hemingway
4873,4874,she was so ugly it would make you sick,whose woman are you,hemingway
4875,4876,robert jordan asked trying not to pull out of it,are you pablos,hemingway
4877,4878,she looked at him and laughed then slapped him on the knee,of pablo,hemingway
4879,4880,you have seen pablo,well then of rafael,hemingway
4881,4882,i have seen rafael,of rafael neither,hemingway
4883,4884,of no one the gypsy said,this is a very strange woman,hemingway
4885,4886,is of no one,but she cooks well,hemingway
4887,4888,really of no one,robert jordan asked her,hemingway
4889,4890,of no one,no one,hemingway
4891,4892,neither in joke nor in seriousness,nor of thee either,hemingway
4893,4894,no,robert jordan said and he could feel the thickness coming in his throat again,hemingway
4895,4896,good,i have no time for any woman,hemingway
4897,4898,that is true,not fifteen minutes,hemingway
4899,4900,the gypsy asked teasingly,not a quarter of an hour,hemingway
4901,4902,robert jordan did not answer,he looked at the girl maria and his throat felt too thick for him to trust himself to speak,hemingway
4903,4904,maria looked at him and laughed then blushed suddenly but kept on looking at him,you are blushing robert jordan said to her,hemingway
4905,4906,do you blush much,never,hemingway
4907,4908,you are blushing now,then i will go into the cave,hemingway
4909,4910,stay here maria,no she said and did not smile at him,hemingway
4911,4912,i will go into the cave now,she picked up the iron plate they had eaten from and the four forks,hemingway
4913,4914,she moved awkwardly as a colt moves but with that same grace as of a young animal,do you want the cups,hemingway
4915,4916,she asked,robert jordan was still looking at her and she blushed again,hemingway
4917,4918,do not make me do that she said,i do not like to do that,hemingway
4919,4920,leave them they gypsy said to her,here he dipped into the stone bowl and handed the full cup to robert jordan who watched the girl duck her head and go into the cave carrying the heavy iron dish,hemingway
4921,4922,thank you robert jordan said,his voice was all right again nowthat she was gone,hemingway
4923,4924,this is the last one,we have had enough of this,hemingway
4925,4926,we will finish the bowl the gypsy said,there is over half a skin,hemingway
4927,4928,we packed it in on one of the horses,that was the last raid of pablo anselmo said,hemingway
4929,4930,since then he has done nothing,howmany are you,hemingway
4931,4932,robert jordan asked,we are seven and there are two women,hemingway
4933,4934,two,yes,hemingway
4935,4936,the mujer of pablo,and she,hemingway
4937,4938,in the cave,the girl can cook a little,hemingway
4939,4940,i said she cooks well to please her,but mostly she helps the mujer of pablo,hemingway
4941,4942,and howis she the mujer of pablo,something barbarous the gypsy grinned,hemingway
4943,4944,something very barbarous,if you think pablo is ugly you should see his woman,hemingway
4945,4946,but brave,a hundred times braver than pablo,hemingway
4947,4948,but something barbarous,pablo was brave in the beginning anselmo said,hemingway
4949,4950,pablo was something serious in the beginning,he killed more people than the cholera the gypsy said,hemingway
4951,4952,at the start of the movement pablo killed more people than the typhoid fever,but since a long time he is muy flojo anselmo said,hemingway
4953,4954,he is very flaccid,he is very much afraid to die,hemingway
4955,4956,it is possible that it is because he has killed so many at the beginning the gypsy said philosophically,pablo killed more than the bubonic plague,hemingway
4957,4958,that and the riches anselmo said,also he drinks very much,hemingway
4959,4960,nowhe would like to retire like a matador de toros,like a bullfighter,hemingway
4961,4962,but he cannot retire,if he crosses to the other side of the lines they will take his horses and make him go in the army the gypsy said,hemingway
4963,4964,in me there is no love for being in the army either,nor is there in any other gypsy anselmo said,hemingway
4965,4966,why should there be,the gypsy asked,hemingway
4967,4968,who wants to be in an army,do we make the revolution to be in an army,hemingway
4969,4970,i am willing to fight but not to be in an army,where are the others,hemingway
4971,4972,asked robert jordan,he felt comfortable and sleepy nowfrom the wine and lying back on the floor of the forest he sawthrough the tree tops the small afternoon clouds of the mountains moving slowly in the high spanish sky,hemingway
4973,4974,there are two asleep in the cave the gypsy said,two are on guard above where we have the gun,hemingway
4975,4976,one is on guard below,they are probably all asleep,hemingway
4977,4978,robert jordan rolled over on his side,what kind of a gun is it,hemingway
4979,4980,a very rare name the gypsy said,it has gone away from me for the moment,hemingway
4981,4982,it is a machine gun,it must be an automatic rifle robert jordan thought,hemingway
4983,4984,howmuch does it weigh,he asked,hemingway
4985,4986,one man can carry it but it is heavy,it has three legs that fold,hemingway
4987,4988,we got it in the last serious raid,the one before the wine,hemingway
4989,4990,howmany rounds have you for it,an infinity the gypsy said,hemingway
4991,4992,one whole case of an unbelievable heaviness,sounds like about five hundred rounds robert jordan thought,hemingway
4993,4994,does it feed from a pan or a belt,from round iron cans on the top of the gun,hemingway
4995,4996,hell its a lewis gun robert jordan thought,do you knowanything about a machine gun,hemingway
4997,4998,he asked the old man,nada said anselmo,hemingway
4999,5000,nothing,and thou,hemingway
5001,5002,to the gypsy,that they fire with much rapidity and become so hot the barrel burns the hand that touches it the gypsy said proudly,hemingway
5003,5004,every one knows that anselmo said with contempt,perhaps the gypsy said,hemingway
5005,5006,but he asked me to tell what i knowabout a maquina and i told him,then he added also unlike an ordinary rifle they continue to fire as long as you exert pressure on the trigger,hemingway
5007,5008,unless they jam run out of ammunition or get so hot they melt robert jordan said in english,what do you say,hemingway
5009,5010,anselmo asked him,nothing robert jordan said,hemingway
5011,5012,i was only looking into the future in english,that is something truly rare the gypsy said,hemingway
5013,5014,looking into the future in i ngles,can you read in the palm of the hand,hemingway
5015,5016,no robert jordan said and he dipped another cup of wine,but if thou canst i wish thee would read in the palm of my hand and tell me what is going to pass in the next three days,hemingway
5017,5018,t h e mujer of pablo reads in the hands the gypsy said,but she is so irritable and of such a barbarousness that i do not knowif she will do it,hemingway
5019,5020,robert jordan sat up nowand took a swallowof the wine,let us see the mujer of pablo now he said,hemingway
5021,5022,if it is that bad let us get it over with,i would not disturb her rafael said,hemingway
5023,5024,she has a strong hatred for me,why,hemingway
5025,5026,she treats me as a time waster,what injustice anselmo taunted,hemingway
5027,5028,she is against gypsies,what an error anselmo said,hemingway
5029,5030,she has gypsy blood rafael said,she knows of what she speaks,hemingway
5031,5032,he grinned,but she has a tongue that scalds and that bites like a bull whip,hemingway
5033,5034,with this tongue she takes the hide from any one,in strips,hemingway
5035,5036,she is of an unbelievable barbarousness,howdoes she get along with the girl maria,hemingway
5037,5038,robert jordan asked,good,hemingway
5039,5040,she likes the girl,but let any one come near her seriously he shook his head and clucked with his tongue,hemingway
5041,5042,she is very good with the girl anselmo said,she takes good care of her,hemingway
5043,5044,when we picked the girl up at the time of the train she was very strange rafael said,she would not speak and she cried all the time and if any one touched her she would shiver like a wet dog,hemingway
5045,5046,only lately has she been better,lately she has been much better,hemingway
5047,5048,today she was fine,just now talking to you she was very good,hemingway
5049,5050,we would have left her after the train,certainly it was not worth being delayed by something so sad and ugly and apparently worthless,hemingway
5051,5052,but the old woman tied a rope to her and when the girl thought she could not go further the old woman beat her with the end of the rope to make her go,then when she could not really go further the old woman carried her over her shoulder,hemingway
5053,5054,when the old woman could not carry her i carried her,we were going up that hill breast high in the gorse and heather,hemingway
5055,5056,and when i could no longer carry her pablo carried her,but what the old woman had to say to us to make us do it,hemingway
5057,5058,he shook his head at the memory,it is true that the girl is long in the legs but is not heavy,hemingway
5059,5060,the bones are light and she weighs little,but she weighs enough when we had to carry her and stop to fire and then carry her again with the old woman lashing at pablo with the rope and carrying his rifle putting it in his hand when he would drop the girl making him pick her up again and loading the gun for him while she cursed him taking the shells from his pouches and shoving them down into the magazine and cursing him,hemingway
5061,5062,the dusk was coming well on then and when the night came it was all right,but it was lucky that they had no cavalry,hemingway
5063,5064,it must have been very hard at the train anselmo said,i was not there he explained to robert jordan,hemingway
5065,5066,there was the band of pablo of el sordo whom we will see tonight and two other bands of these mountains,i had gone to the other side of the lines,hemingway
5067,5068,in addition to the blond one with the rare name  the gypsy said,kashkin,hemingway
5069,5070,yes,it is a name i can never dominate,hemingway
5071,5072,we had two with a machine gun,they were sent also by the army,hemingway
5073,5074,they could not get the gun away and lost it,certainly it weighed no more than that girl and if the old woman had been over them they would have gotten it away,hemingway
5075,5076,he shook his head remembering then went on,never in my life have i seen such a thing as when the explosion was produced,hemingway
5077,5078,the train was coming steadily,we sawit far away,hemingway
5079,5080,and i had an excitement so great that i cannot tell it,we sawsteam from it and then later came the noise of the whistle,hemingway
5081,5082,then it came chuchuchuchuchuchu steadily larger and larger and then at the moment of the explosion the front wheels of the engine rose up and all of the earth seemed to rise in a great cloud of blackness and a roar and the engine rose high in the cloud of dirt and of the wooden ties rising in the air as in a dream and then it fell onto its side like a great wounded animal and there was an explosion of white steam before the clods of the other explosion had ceased to fall on us and the maquina commenced to speak tatattatta,went the gypsy shaking his two clenched fists up and down in front of him thumbs up on an imaginary machine gun,hemingway
5083,5084,ta,ta,hemingway
5085,5086,tat,tat,hemingway
5087,5088,tat,ta,hemingway
5089,5090,he exulted,never in my life have i seen such a thing with the troops running from the train and the maquina speaking into them and the men falling,hemingway
5091,5092,it was then that i put my hand on the maquina in my excitement and discovered that the barrel burned and at that moment the old woman slapped me on the side of the face and said shoot you fool,shoot or i will kick your brains in,hemingway
5093,5094,then i commenced to shoot but it was very hard to hold my gun steady and the troops were running up the far hill,later after we had been down at the train to see what there was to take an officer forced some troops back toward us at the point of a pistol,hemingway
5095,5096,he kept waving the pistol and shouting at them and we were all shooting at him but no one hit him,then some troops lay down and commenced firing and the officer walked up and down behind them with his pistol and still we could not hit him and the maquina could not fire on him because of the position of the train,hemingway
5097,5098,this officer shot two men as they lay and still they would not get up and he was cursing them and finally they got up one two and three at a time and came running toward us and the train,then they lay flat again and fired,hemingway
5099,5100,then we left with the maquina still speaking over us as we left,it was then i found the girl where she had run from the train to the rocks and she ran with us,hemingway
5101,5102,it was those troops who hunted us until that night,it must have been something very hard anselmo said,hemingway
5103,5104,of much emotion,it was the only good thing we have done said a deep voice,hemingway
5105,5106,what are you doing now you lazy drunken obscene unsayable son of an unnameable unmarried gypsy obscenity,what are you doing,hemingway
5107,5108,robert jordan sawa woman of about fifty almost as big as pablo almost as wide as she was tall in black peasant skirt and waist with heavy wool socks on heavy legs black ropesoled shoes and a brown face like a model for a granite monument,she had big but nicelooking hands and her thick curly black hair was twisted into a knot on her neck,hemingway
5109,5110,answer me she said to the gypsy ignoring the others,i was talking to these comrades,hemingway
5111,5112,this one comes as a dynamiter,i knowall that the mujer of pablo said,hemingway
5113,5114,get out of here nowand relieve andres who is on guard at the top,me voy the gypsy said,hemingway
5115,5116,i go,he turned to robert jordan,hemingway
5117,5118,i will see thee at the hour of eating,not even in a joke said the woman to him,hemingway
5119,5120,three times you have eaten today according to my count,go nowand send me andres,hemingway
5121,5122,hola she said to robert jordan and put out her hand and smiled,howare you and howis everything in the republic,hemingway
5123,5124,good he said and returned her strong hand grip,both with me and with the republic,hemingway
5125,5126,i am happy she told him,she was looking into his face and smiling and he noticed she had fine gray eyes,hemingway
5127,5128,do you come for us to do another train,no said robert jordan trusting her instantly,hemingway
5129,5130,for a bridge,no es nada she said,hemingway
5131,5132,a bridge is nothing,when do we do another train nowthat we have horses,hemingway
5133,5134,later,this bridge is of great importance,hemingway
5135,5136,the girl told me your comrade who was with us at the train is dead,yes,hemingway
5137,5138,what a pity,never have i seen such an explosion,hemingway
5139,5140,he was a man of talent,he pleased me very much,hemingway
5141,5142,it is not possible to do another train now,there are many men here nowin the hills,hemingway
5143,5144,too many,it is already hard to get food,hemingway
5145,5146,it would be better to get out,and we have horses,hemingway
5147,5148,we have to do this bridge,where is it,hemingway
5149,5150,quite close,all the better the mujer of pablo said,hemingway
5151,5152,let us blowall the bridges there are here and get out,i am sick of this place,hemingway
5153,5154,here is too much concentration of people,no good can come of it,hemingway
5155,5156,here is a stagnation that is repugnant,she sighted pablo through the trees,hemingway
5157,5158,borracho,she called to him,hemingway
5159,5160,drunkard,rotten drunkard,hemingway
5161,5162,she turned back to robert jordan cheerfully,he is taken a leather wine bottle to drink alone in the woods she said,hemingway
5163,5164,he is drinking all the time,this life is ruining him,hemingway
5165,5166,young man i am very content that you have come,she clapped him on the back,hemingway
5167,5168,ah she said,you are bigger than you look and ran her hand over his shoulder feeling the muscle under the flannel shirt,hemingway
5169,5170,good,i am very content that you have come,hemingway
5171,5172,and i equally,we will understand each other she said,hemingway
5173,5174,have a cup of wine,we have already had some robert jordan said,hemingway
5175,5176,but will you,not until dinner she said,hemingway
5177,5178,it gives me heartburn,then she sighted pablo again,hemingway
5179,5180,borracho,she shouted,hemingway
5181,5182,drunkard,she turned to robert jordan and shook her head,hemingway
5183,5184,he was a very good man she told him,but nowhe is terminated,hemingway
5185,5186,and listen to me about another thing,be very good and careful about the girl,hemingway
5187,5188,the maria,she has had a bad time,hemingway
5189,5190,understandest thou,yes,hemingway
5191,5192,why do you say this,i sawhowshe was from seeing thee when she came into the cave,hemingway
5193,5194,i sawher watching thee before she came out,i joked with her a little,hemingway
5195,5196,she was in a very bad state the woman of pablo said,nowshe is better she ought to get out of here,hemingway
5197,5198,clearly she can be sent through the lines with anselmo,you and the anselmo can take her when this terminates,hemingway
5199,5200,robert jordan felt the ache in his throat and his voice thickening,that might be done he said,hemingway
5201,5202,the mujer of pablo looked at him and shook her head,ayee,hemingway
5203,5204,ayee she said,are all men like that,hemingway
5205,5206,i said nothing,she is beautiful you knowthat,hemingway
5207,5208,no she is not beautiful,but she begins to be beautiful you mean the woman of pablo said,hemingway
5209,5210,men,it is a shame to us women that we make them,hemingway
5211,5212,no,in seriousness,hemingway
5213,5214,are there not homes to care for such as her under the republic,yes said robert jordan,hemingway
5215,5216,good places,on the coast near valencia,hemingway
5217,5218,in other places too,there they will treat her well and she can work with children,hemingway
5219,5220,there are the children from evacuated villages,they will teach her the work,hemingway
5221,5222,that is what i want the mujer of pablo said,pablo has a sickness for her already,hemingway
5223,5224,it is another thing which destroys him,it lies on him like a sickness when he sees her,hemingway
5225,5226,it is best that she goes now,we can take her after this is over,hemingway
5227,5228,and you will be careful of her nowif i trust you,i speak to you as though i knewyou for a long time,hemingway
5229,5230,it is like that robert jordan said when people understand one another,sit down the woman of pablo said,hemingway
5231,5232,i do not ask any promise because what will happen will happen,only if you will not take her out then i ask a promise,hemingway
5233,5234,why if i would not take her,because i do not want her crazy here after you will go,hemingway
5235,5236,i have had her crazy before and i have enough without that,we will take her after the bridge robert jordan said,hemingway
5237,5238,if we are alive after the bridge we will take her,i do not like to hear you speak in that manner,hemingway
5239,5240,that manner of speaking never brings luck,i spoke in that manner only to make a promise robert jordan said,hemingway
5241,5242,i am not of those who speak gloomily,let me see thy hand the woman said,hemingway
5243,5244,robert jordan put his hand out and the woman opened it held it in her own big hand rubbed her thumb over it and looked at it carefully then dropped it,she stood up,hemingway
5245,5246,he got up too and she looked at him without smiling,what did you see in it,hemingway
5247,5248,robert jordan asked her,i do not believe in it,hemingway
5249,5250,you will not scare me,nothing she told him,hemingway
5251,5252,i sawnothing in it,yes you did,hemingway
5253,5254,i am only curious,i do not believe in such things,hemingway
5255,5256,in what do you believe,in many things but not in that,hemingway
5257,5258,in what,in my work,hemingway
5259,5260,yes i sawthat,tell me what else you saw,hemingway
5261,5262,i sawnothing else she said bitterly,the bridge is very difficult you said,hemingway
5263,5264,no,i said it is very important,hemingway
5265,5266,but it can be difficult,yes,hemingway
5267,5268,and nowi go down to look at it,howmany men have you here,hemingway
5269,5270,five that are any good,the gypsy is worthless although his intentions are good,hemingway
5271,5272,he has a good heart,pablo i no longer trust,hemingway
5273,5274,howmany men has el sordo that are good,perhaps eight,hemingway
5275,5276,we will see tonight,he is coming here,hemingway
5277,5278,he is a very practical man,he also has some dynamite,hemingway
5279,5280,not very much though,you will speak with him,hemingway
5281,5282,have you sent for him,he comes every night,hemingway
5283,5284,he is a neighbor,also a friend as well as a comrade,hemingway
5285,5286,what do you think of him,he is a very good man,hemingway
5287,5288,also very practical,in the business of the train he was enormous,hemingway
5289,5290,and in the other bands,advising them in time it should be possible to unite fifty rifles of a certain dependability,hemingway
5291,5292,howdependable,dependable within the gravity of the situation,hemingway
5293,5294,and howmany cartridges per rifle,perhaps twenty,hemingway
5295,5296,depending howmany they would bring for this business,if they would come for this business,hemingway
5297,5298,remember thee that in this of a bridge there is no money and no loot and in thy reservations of talking much danger and that afterwards there must be a moving from these mountains,many will oppose this of the bridge,hemingway
5299,5300,clearly,in this way it is better not to speak of it unnecessarily,hemingway
5301,5302,i am in accord,then after thou hast studied thy bridge we will talk tonight with el sordo,hemingway
5303,5304,i go down nowwith anselmo,wake him then she said,hemingway
5305,5306,do you want a carbine,thank you he told her,hemingway
5307,5308,it is good to have but i will not use it,i go to look not to make disturbances,hemingway
5309,5310,thank you for what you have told me,i like very much your way of speaking,hemingway
5311,5312,i try to speak frankly,then tell me what you sawin the hand,hemingway
5313,5314,no she said and shook her head,i sawnothing,hemingway
5315,5316,go nowto thy bridge,i will look after thy equipment,hemingway
5317,5318,cover it and that no one should touch it,it is better there than in the cave,hemingway
5319,5320,it shall be covered and no one shall touch it the woman of pablo said,go nowto thy bridge,hemingway
5321,5322,anselmo robert jordan said putting his hand on the shoulder of the old man who lay sleeping his head on his arms,the old man looked up,hemingway
5323,5324,yes he said,of course,hemingway
5325,5326,let us go,they came down the last two hundred yards moving carefully from tree to tree in the shadows and now through the last pines of the steep hillside the bridge was only fifty yards away,hemingway
5327,5328,the late afternoon sun that still came over the brown shoulder of the mountain showed the bridge dark against the steep emptiness of the gorge,it was a steel bridge of a single span and there was a sentry box at each end,hemingway
5329,5330,it was wide enough for two motor cars to pass and it spanned in solidflung metal grace a deep gorge at the bottom of which far below a brook leaped in white water through rocks and boulders down to the main stream of the pass,the sun was in robert jordans eyes and the bridge showed only in outline,hemingway
5331,5332,then the sun lessened and was gone and looking up through the trees at the brown rounded height that it had gone behind he saw now that he no longer looked into the glare that the mountain slope was a delicate newgreen and that there were patches of old snowunder the crest,then he was watching the bridge again in the sudden short trueness of the little light that would be left and studying its construction,hemingway
5333,5334,the problem of its demolition was not difficult,as he watched he took out a notebook from his breast pocket and made several quick line sketches,hemingway
5335,5336,as he made the drawings he did not figure the charges,he would do that later,hemingway
5337,5338,nowhe was noting the points where the explosive should be placed in order to cut the support of the span and drop a section of it into the gorge,it could be done unhurriedly scientifically and correctly with a half dozen charges laid and braced to explode simultaneously or it could be done roughly with two big ones,hemingway
5339,5340,they would need to be very big ones on opposite sides and should go at the same time,he sketched quickly and happily glad at last to have the problem under his hand glad at last actually to be engaged upon it,hemingway
5341,5342,then he shut his notebook pushed the pencil into its leather holder in the edge of the flap put the notebook in his pocket and buttoned the pocket,while he had sketched anselmo had been watching the road the bridge and the sentry boxes,hemingway
5343,5344,he thought they had come too close to the bridge for safety and when the sketching was finished he was relieved,as robert jordan buttoned the flap of his pocket and then lay flat behind the pine trunk looking out from behind it anselmo put his hand on his elbowand pointed with one finger,hemingway
5345,5346,in the sentry box that faced toward them up the road the sentry was sitting holding his rifle the bayonet fixed between his knees,he was smoking a cigarette and he wore a knitted cap and blanket style cape,hemingway
5347,5348,at fifty yards you could not see anything about his face,robert jordan put up his field glasses shading the lenses carefully with his cupped hands even though there was nowno sun to make a glint and there was the rail of the bridge as clear as though you could reach out and touch it and there was the face of the senty so clear he could see the sunken cheeks the ash on the cigarette and the greasy shine of the bayonet,hemingway
5349,5350,it was a peasants face the cheeks hollowunder the high cheekbones the beard stubbled the eyes shaded by the heavy brows big hands holding the rifle heavy boots showing beneath the folds of the blanket cape,there was a worn blackened leather wine bottle on the wall of the sentry box there were some newspapers and there was no telephone,hemingway
5351,5352,there could of course be a telephone on the side he could not see but there were no wires running from the box that were visible,a telephone line ran along the road and its wires were carried over the bridge,hemingway
5353,5354,there was a charcoal brazier outside the sentry box made from an old petrol tin with the top cut off and holes punched in it which rested on two stones but he held no fire,there were some fireblackened empty tins in the ashes under it,hemingway
5355,5356,robert jordan handed the glasses to anselmo who lay flat beside him,the old man grinned and shook his head,hemingway
5357,5358,he tapped his skull beside his eye with one finger,y a lo veo he said in spanish,hemingway
5359,5360,i have seen him speaking from the front of his mouth with almost no movement of his lips in the way that is quieter than any whisper,he looked at the sentry as robert jordan smiled at him and pointing with one finger drewthe other across his throat,hemingway
5361,5362,robert jordan nodded but he did not smile,the sentry box at the far end of the bridge faced away from them and down the road and they could not see into it,hemingway
5363,5364,the road which was broad and oiled and well constructed made a turn to the left at the far end of the bridge and then swung out of sight around a curve to the right,at this point it was enlarged from the old road to its present width by cutting into the solid bastion of the rock on the far side of the gorge and its left or western edge looking down from the pass and the bridge was marked and protected by a line of upright cut blocks of stone where its edge fell sheer away to the gorge,hemingway
5365,5366,the gorge was almost a canyon here where the brook that the bridge was flung over merged with the main stream of the pass,and the other post,hemingway
5367,5368,robert jordan asked anselmo,five hundred meters belowthat turn,hemingway
5369,5370,in the roadmenders hut that is built into the side of the rock,howmany men,hemingway
5371,5372,robert jordan asked,he was watching the sentry again with his glasses,hemingway
5373,5374,the sentry rubbed his cigarette out on the plank wall of the box then took a leather tobacco pouch from his pocket opened the paper of the dead cigarette and emptied the remnant of used tobacco into the pouch,the sentry stood up leaned his rifle against the wall of the box and stretched then picked up his rifle slung it over his shoulder and walked out onto the bridge,hemingway
5375,5376,anselmo flattened on the ground and robert jordan slipped his glasses into his shirt pocket and put his head well behind the pine tree,there are seven men and a corporal anselmo said close to his ear,hemingway
5377,5378,i informed myself from the gypsy,we will go nowas soon as he is quiet robert jordan said,hemingway
5379,5380,we are too close,hast thou seen what thou needest,hemingway
5381,5382,yes,all that i need,hemingway
5383,5384,it was getting cold quickly nowwith the sun down and the light was failing as the afterglowfrom the last sunlight on the mountains behind them faded,howdoes it look to thee,hemingway
5385,5386,anselmo said softly as they watched the sentry walk across the bridge toward the other box his bayonet bright in the last of the afterglow his figure unshapely in the blanket coat,very good robert jordan said,hemingway
5387,5388,very very good,i am glad anselmo said,hemingway
5389,5390,should we go,nowthere is no chance that he sees us,hemingway
5391,5392,the sentry was standing his back toward them at the far end of the bridge,from the gorge came the noise of the stream in the boulders,hemingway
5393,5394,then through this noise came another noise a steady racketing drone and they sawthe sentry looking up his knitted cap slanted back and turning their heads and looking up they saw high in the evening sky three monoplanes in v formation showing minute and silvery at that height where there still was sun passing unbelievably quickly across the sky their motors nowthrobbing steadily,ours,hemingway
5395,5396,anselmo asked,they seem so robert jordan said but knewthat at that height you never could be sure,hemingway
5397,5398,they could be an evening patrol of either side,but you always said pursuit planes were ours because it made people feel better,hemingway
5399,5400,bombers were another matter,anselmo evidently felt the same,hemingway
5401,5402,they are ours he said,i recognize them,hemingway
5403,5404,they are moscas,good said robert jordan,hemingway
5405,5406,they seem to me to be moscas too,they are moscas anselmo said,hemingway
5407,5408,robert jordan could have put the glasses on them and been sure instantly but he preferred not to,it made no difference to him who they were tonight and if it pleased the old man to have them be ours he did not want to take them away,hemingway
5409,5410,now as they moved out of sight toward segovia they did not look to be the green red wingtipped lowwing russian conversion of the boeing p32 that the spaniards called moscas,you could not see the colors but the cut was wrong,hemingway
5411,5412,no,it was a fascist patrol coming home,hemingway
5413,5414,the sentry was still standing at the far box with his back turned,let us go robert jordan said,hemingway
5415,5416,he started up the hill moving carefully and taking advantage of the cover until they were out of sight,anselmo followed him at a hundred yards distance,hemingway
5417,5418,when they were well out of sight of the bridge he stopped and the old man came up and went into the lead and climbed steadily through the pass up the steep slope in the dark,we have a formidable aviation the old man said happily,hemingway
5419,5420,yes,and we will win,hemingway
5421,5422,we have to win,yes,hemingway
5423,5424,and after we have won you must come to hunt,to hunt what,hemingway
5425,5426,the boar the bear the wolf the ibex you like to hunt,yes man,hemingway
5427,5428,more than anything,we all hunt in my village,hemingway
5429,5430,you do not like to hunt,no said robert jordan,hemingway
5431,5432,i do not like to kill animals,with me it is the opposite the old man said,hemingway
5433,5434,i do not like to kill men,nobody does except those who are disturbed in the head robert jordan said,hemingway
5435,5436,but i feel nothing against it when it is necessary,when it is for the cause,hemingway
5437,5438,it is a different thing though anselmo said,in my house when i had a house and nowi have no house there were the tusks of boar i had shot in the lower forest,hemingway
5439,5440,there were the hides of wolves i had shot,in the winter hunting them in the snow,hemingway
5441,5442,one very big one i killed at dusk in the outskirts of the village on my way home one night in november,there were four wolf hides on the floor of my house,hemingway
5443,5444,they were worn by stepping on them but they were wolf hides,there were the horns of ibex that i had killed in the high sierra and there was an eagle stuffed by an embalmer of birds of avila with his wings spread and eyes as yellowand real as the eyes of an eagle alive,hemingway
5445,5446,it was a very beautiful thing and all of those things gave me great pleasure to contemplate,yes said robert jordan,hemingway
5447,5448,on the door of the church of my village was nailed the pawof a bear that i killed in the spring finding him on a hillside in the snow overturning a log with this same paw,when was this,hemingway
5449,5450,six years ago,and every time i sawthat paw like the hand of a man but with those long claws dried and nailed through the palm to the door of the church i received a pleasure,hemingway
5451,5452,of pride,of pride of remembrance of the encounter with the bear on that hillside in the early spring,hemingway
5453,5454,but of the killing of a man who is a man as we are there is nothing good that remains,you can not nail his pawto the church robert jordan said,hemingway
5455,5456,no,such a barbarity is unthinkable,hemingway
5457,5458,yet the hand of a man is like the pawof a bear,so is the chest of a man like the chest of a bear robert jordan said,hemingway
5459,5460,with the hide removed from the bear there are many similarities in the muscles,yes anselmo said,hemingway
5461,5462,the gypsies believe the bear to be a brother of man,so do the indians in america robert jordan said,hemingway
5463,5464,and when they kill a bear they apologize to him and ask his pardon,they put his skull in a tree and they ask him to forgive them before they leave it,hemingway
5465,5466,the gypsies believe the bear to be a brother to man because he has the same body beneath his hide because he drinks beer because he enjoys music and because he likes to dance,so also believe the indians,hemingway
5467,5468,are the indians then gypsies,no,hemingway
5469,5470,but they believe alike about the bear,clearly,hemingway
5471,5472,the gypsies also believe he is a brother because he steals for pleasure,have you gypsy blood,hemingway
5473,5474,no,but i have seen much of them and clearly since the movement more,hemingway
5475,5476,there are many in the hills,to them it is not a sin to kill outside the tribe,hemingway
5477,5478,they deny this but it is true,like the moors,hemingway
5479,5480,yes,but the gypsies have many laws they do not admit to having,hemingway
5481,5482,in the war many gypsies have become bad again as they were in olden times,they do not understand why the war is made,hemingway
5483,5484,they do not knowfor what we fight,no anselmo said,hemingway
5485,5486,they only knownowthere is a war and people may kill again as in the olden times without a surety of punishment,you have killed,hemingway
5487,5488,robert jordan asked in the intimacy of the dark and of their day together,yes,hemingway
5489,5490,several times,but not with pleasure,hemingway
5491,5492,to me it is a sin to kill a man,even fascists whom we must kill,hemingway
5493,5494,to me there is a great difference between the bear and the man and i do not believe the wizardry of the gypsies about the brotherhood with animals,no,hemingway
5495,5496,i am against all killing of men,yet you have killed,hemingway
5497,5498,yes,and will again,hemingway
5499,5500,but if i live later i will try to live in such a way doing no harm to any one that it will be forgiven,by whom,hemingway
5501,5502,who knows,since we do not have god here any more neither his son nor the holy ghost who forgives,hemingway
5503,5504,i do not know,you have not god any more,hemingway
5505,5506,no,man,hemingway
5507,5508,certainly not,if there were god never would he have permitted what i have seen with my eyes,hemingway
5509,5510,let them have god,they claim him,hemingway
5511,5512,clearly i miss him having been brought up in religion,but nowa man must be responsible to himself,hemingway
5513,5514,then it is thyself who will forgive thee for killing,i believe so anselmo said,hemingway
5515,5516,since you put it clearly in that way i believe that must be it,but with or without god i think it is a sin to kill,hemingway
5517,5518,to take the life of another is to me very grave,i will do it whenever necessary but i am not of the race of pablo,hemingway
5519,5520,to win a war we must kill our enemies,that has always been true,hemingway
5521,5522,clearly,in war we must kill,hemingway
5523,5524,but i have very rare ideas anselmo said,they were walking nowclose together in the dark and he spoke softly sometimes turning his head as he climbed,hemingway
5525,5526,i would not kill even a bishop,i would not kill a proprietor of any kind,hemingway
5527,5528,i would make them work each day as we have worked in the fields and as we work in the mountains with the timbet all of the rest of their lives,so they would see what man is born to,hemingway
5529,5530,that they should sleep where we sleep,that they should eat as we eat,hemingway
5531,5532,but above all that they should work,thus they would learn,hemingway
5533,5534,and they would survive to enslave thee again,to kill them teaches nothing anselmo said,hemingway
5535,5536,you cannot exterminate them because from their seed comes more with greater hatred,prison is nothing,hemingway
5537,5538,prison only makes hatred,that all our enemies should learn,hemingway
5539,5540,but still thou hast killed,yes anselmo said,hemingway
5541,5542,many times and will again,but not with pleasure and regarding it as a sin,hemingway
5543,5544,and the sentry,you joked of killing the sentry,hemingway
5545,5546,that was in joke,i would kill the sentry,hemingway
5547,5548,yes,certainly and with a clear heart considering our task,hemingway
5549,5550,but not with pleasure,we will leave them to those who enjoy it robert jordan said,hemingway
5551,5552,there are eight and five,that is thirteen for those who enjoy it,hemingway
5553,5554,there are many of those who enjoy it anselmo said in the dark,we have many of those,hemingway
5555,5556,more of those than of men who would serve for a battle,hast thou ever been in a battle,hemingway
5557,5558,nay the old man said,we fought in segovia at the start of the movement but we were beaten and we ran,hemingway
5559,5560,i ran with the others,we did not truly understand what we were doing nor howit should be done,hemingway
5561,5562,also i had only a shotgun with cartridges of large buckshot and the guardia civil had mausers,i could not hit them with buckshot at a hundred yards and at three hundred yards they shot us as they wished as though we were rabbits,hemingway
5563,5564,they shot much and well and we were like sheep before them,he was silent,hemingway
5565,5566,then asked thinkest thou there will be a battle at the bridge,there is a chance,hemingway
5567,5568,i have never seen a battle without running anselmo said,i do not knowhowi would comport myself,hemingway
5569,5570,i am an old man and i have wondered,i will respond for thee robert jordan told him,hemingway
5571,5572,and hast thou been in many battles,several,hemingway
5573,5574,and what thinkest thou of this of the bridge,first i think of the bridge,hemingway
5575,5576,that is my business,it is not difficult to destroy the bridge,hemingway
5577,5578,then we will make the dispositions for the rest,for the preliminaries,hemingway
5579,5580,it will all be written,very fewof these people read anselmo said,hemingway
5581,5582,it will be written for every ones knowledge so that all know but also it will be clearly explained,i will do that to which i am assigned anselmo said,hemingway
5583,5584,but remembering the shooting in segovia if there is to be a battle or even much exchanging of shots i would wish to have it very clear what i must do under all circumstances to avoid running,i remember that i had a great tendency to run at segovia,hemingway
5585,5586,we will be together robert jordan told him,i will tell you what there is to do at all times,hemingway
5587,5588,then there is no problem anselmo said,i can do anything that i am ordered,hemingway
5589,5590,for us will be the bridge and the battle should there be one robert jordan said and saying it in the dark he felt a little theatrical but it sounded well in spanish,it should be of the highest interest anselmo said and hearing him say it honestly and clearly and with no pose neither the english pose of understatement nor any latin bravado robert jordan thought he was very lucky to have this old man and having seen the bridge and worked out and simplified the problem it would have been to surprise the posts and blowit in a normal way he resented golzs orders and the necessity for them,hemingway
5591,5592,he resented them for what they could do to him and for what they could do to this old man,they were bad orders all right for those who would have to carry them out,hemingway
5593,5594,and that is not the way to think he told himself and there is not you and there are no people that things must not happen to,neither you nor this old man is anything,hemingway
5595,5596,you are instruments to do your duty,there are necessary orders that are no fault of yours and there is a bridge and that bridge can be the point on which the future of the human race can turn,hemingway
5597,5598,as it can turn on everything that happens in this war,you have only one thing to do and you must do it,hemingway
5599,5600,only one thing hell he thought,if it were one thing it was easy,hemingway
5601,5602,stop worrying you windy bastard he said to himself,think about something else,hemingway
5603,5604,so he thought about the girl maria with her skin the hair and the eyes all the same golden tawny brown the hair a little darker than the rest but it would be lighter as her skin tanned deeper the smooth skin pale gold on the surface with a darkness underneath,smooth it would be all of her body smooth and she moved awkwardly as though there were something of her and about her that embarrassed her as though it were visible though it was not but only in her mind,hemingway
5605,5606,and she blushed with he looked at her and she sitting her hands clasped around her knees and the shirt open at the throat the cup of her breasts uptilted against the shirt and as he thought of her his throat was choky and there was a difficulty in walking and he and anselmo spoke no more until the old man said nowwe go down through these rocks and to the camp,as they came through the rocks in the dark a man spoke to them halt,hemingway
5607,5608,who goes,they heard a rifle bolt snick as it was drawn back and then the knock against the wood as it was pushed forward and down on the stock,hemingway
5609,5610,comrades anselmo said,what comrades,hemingway
5611,5612,comrades of pablo the old man told him,dost thou not knowus,hemingway
5613,5614,yes the voice said,but it is an order,hemingway
5615,5616,have you the password,no,hemingway
5617,5618,we come from below,i know the man said in the dark,hemingway
5619,5620,you come from the bridge,i knowall of that,hemingway
5621,5622,the order is not mine,you must knowthe second half of a password,hemingway
5623,5624,what is the first half then,robert jordan said,hemingway
5625,5626,i have forgotten it the man said in the dark and laughed,go then unprintably to the campfire with thy obscene dynamite,hemingway
5627,5628,that is called guerilla discipline anselmo said,uncock thy piece,hemingway
5629,5630,it is uncocked the man said in the dark,i let it down with my thumb and forefinger,hemingway
5631,5632,thou wilt do that with a mauser sometime which has no knurl on the bolt and it will fire,this is a mauser the man said,hemingway
5633,5634,but i have a grip of thumb and forefinger beyond description,always i let it down that way,hemingway
5635,5636,where is the rifle pointed,asked anselmo into the dark,hemingway
5637,5638,at thee the man said all the time that i descended the bolt,and when thou comest to the camp order that some one should relieve me because i have indescribable and unprintable hunger and i have forgotten the password,hemingway
5639,5640,howart thou called,robert jordan asked,hemingway
5641,5642,agustin the man said,i am called agustin and i am dying with boredom in this spot,hemingway
5643,5644,we will take the message robert jordan said and he thought howthe word aburmiento which means boredom in spanish was a word no peasant would use in any other language,yet it is one of the most common words in the mouth of a spaniard of any class,hemingway
5645,5646,listen to me agustin said and coming close he put his hand on robert jordans shoulder,then striking a flint and steel together he held it up and blowing on the end of the cork looked at the young mans face in its glow,hemingway
5647,5648,you look like the other one he said,but something different,hemingway
5649,5650,listen he put the lighter down and stood holding his rifle,tell me this,hemingway
5651,5652,is it true about the bridge,what about the bridge,hemingway
5653,5654,that we blowup an obscene bridge and then have to obscenely well obscenity ourselves off out of these mountains,i knownot,hemingway
5655,5656,y ou knownot agustin said,what a barbarity,hemingway
5657,5658,whose then is the dynamite,mine,hemingway
5659,5660,and knowest thou not what it is for,do not tell me tales,hemingway
5661,5662,i knowwhat it is for and so will you in time robert jordan said,but nowwe go to the camp,hemingway
5663,5664,go to the unprintable agustin said,and unprint thyself,hemingway
5665,5666,but do you want me to tell you something of service to you,yessaidrobertjordan,hemingway
5667,5668,ifitisnot unprintable naming the principal obscenity that had larded the conversation,the man agustin spoke so obscenely coupling an obscenity to every noun as an adjective using the same obscenity as a verb that robert jordan wondered if he could speak a straight sentence,hemingway
5669,5670,agustin laughed in the dark when he heard the word,it is a way of speaking i have,hemingway
5671,5672,maybe it is ugly,who knows,hemingway
5673,5674,each one speaks according to his manner,listen to me,hemingway
5675,5676,the bridge is nothing to me,as well the bridge as another thing,hemingway
5677,5678,also i have a boredom in these mountains,that we should go if it is needed,hemingway
5679,5680,these mountains say nothing to me,that we should leave them,hemingway
5681,5682,but i would say one thing,guard well thy explosive,hemingway
5683,5684,thank you robert jordan said,from thee,hemingway
5685,5686,no agustin said,from people less unprintably equipped than i,hemingway
5687,5688,so,asked robert jordan,hemingway
5689,5690,you understand spanish agustin said seriously now,care well for thy unprintable explosive,hemingway
5691,5692,thank you,no,hemingway
5693,5694,do not thank me,look after thy stuff,hemingway
5695,5696,has anything happened to it,no or i would not waste thy time talking in this fashion,hemingway
5697,5698,thank you all the same,we go nowto camp,hemingway
5699,5700,good said agustin and that they send some one here who knows the password,will we see you at the camp,hemingway
5701,5702,yes man,and shortly,hemingway
5703,5704,come on robert jordan said to anselmo,they were walking down the edge of the meadownowand there was a gray mist,hemingway
5705,5706,the grass was lush underfoot after the pineneedle floor of the forest and the dewon the grass wet through their canvas ropesoled shoes,ahead through the trees robert jordan could see a light where he knewthe mouth of the cave must be,hemingway
5707,5708,agustin is a very good man anselmo said,he speaks very filthily and always in jokes but he is a very serious man,hemingway
5709,5710,you knowhim well,yes,hemingway
5711,5712,for a long time,i have much confidence in him,hemingway
5713,5714,and what he says,yes man,hemingway
5715,5716,this pablo is bad now as you could see,and the best thing to do,hemingway
5717,5718,one shall guard it at all times,who,hemingway
5719,5720,you,me,hemingway
5721,5722,the woman and agustin,since he sees the danger,hemingway
5723,5724,did you think things were as bad as they are here,no anselmo said,hemingway
5725,5726,they have gone bad very fast,but it was necessary to come here,hemingway
5727,5728,this is the country of pablo and of el sordo,in their country we must deal with them unless it is something that can be done alone,hemingway
5729,5730,and el sordo,good anselmo said,hemingway
5731,5732,as good as the other is bad,you believe nowthat he is truly bad,hemingway
5733,5734,all afternoon i have thought of it and since we have heard what we have heard i think now yes,truly,hemingway
5735,5736,it would not be better to leave speaking of another bridge and obtain men from other bands,no anselmo said,hemingway
5737,5738,this is his country,you could not move that he would not knowit,hemingway
5739,5740,but one must move with much precautions,they came down to the mouth of the cave where a light shone out from the edge of a blanket that hung over the opening,hemingway
5741,5742,the two packs were at the foot of the tree covered with a canvas and robert jordan knelt down and felt the canvas wet and stiff over them,in the dark he felt under the canvas in the outside pocket of one of the packs and took out a leathercovered flask and slipped it in his pocket,hemingway
5743,5744,unlocking the long barred padlocks that passed through the grommet that closed the opening of the mouth of the packs and untying the drawstring at the top of each pack he felt inside them and verified their contents with his hands,deep in one pack he felt the bundled blocks in the sacks the sacks wrapped in the sleeping robe and tying the strings of that and pushing the lock shut again he put his hands into the other and felt the sharp wood outline of the box of the old exploder the cigar box with the caps each little cylinder wrapped round and round with its two wires the lot of them packed as carefully as he had packed his collection of wild bird eggs when he was a boy the stock of the submachine gun disconnected from the barrel and wrapped in his leather jacket the two pans and five clips in one of the inner pockets of the big pack sack arid the small coils of copper wire and the big coil of light insulated wire in the other,hemingway
5745,5746,in the pocket with the wire he felt his pliers and the two wooden awls for making holes in the end of the blocks and then from the last inside pocket he took a big box of the russian cigarettes of the lot he had from golzs headquarters and tying the mouth of the pack shut he pushed the lock in buckled the flaps down and again covered both packs with the canvas,anselmo had gone on into the cave,hemingway
5747,5748,robert jordan stood up to followhim then reconsidered and lifting the canvas off the two packs picked them up one in each hand and started with them just able to carry them for the mouth of the cave,he laid one pack down and lifted the blanket aside then with his head stooped and with a pack in each hand carrying by the leather shoulder straps he went into the cave,hemingway
5749,5750,it was warm and smoky in the cave,there was a table along one wall with a tallowcandle stuck in a bottle on it and at the table were seated pablo three men he did not know and the gypsy rafael,hemingway
5751,5752,the candle made shadows on the wall behind the men and anselmo stood where he had come in to the right of the table,the wife of pablo was standing over the charcoal fire on the open fire hearth in the corner of the cave,hemingway
5753,5754,the girl knelt by her stirring in an iron pot,she lifted the wooden spoon out and looked at robert jordan as he stood there in the doorway and he saw in the glowfrom the fire the woman was blowing with a bellows the girls face her arm and the drops running down from the spoon and dropping into the iron pot,hemingway
5755,5756,what do you carry,pablo said,hemingway
5757,5758,my things robert jordan said and set the two packs down a little way apart where the cave opened out on the side away from the table,are they not well outside,hemingway
5759,5760,pablo asked,some one might trip over them in the dark robert jordan said and walked over to the table and laid the box of cigarettes on it,hemingway
5761,5762,i do not like to have dynamite here in the cave pablo said,it is far from the fire robert jordan said,hemingway
5763,5764,take some cigarettes,he ran his thumbnail along the side of the paper box with the big colored figure of a warship on the cover and pushed the box toward pablo,hemingway
5765,5766,anselmo brought him a rawhidecovered stool and he sat down at the table,pablo looked at him as though he were going to speak again then reached for the cigarettes,hemingway
5767,5768,robert jordan pushed them toward the others,he was not looking at them yet,hemingway
5769,5770,but he noted one man took cigarettes and two did not,all of his concentration was on pablo,hemingway
5771,5772,howgoes it gypsy,he said to rafael,hemingway
5773,5774,good the gypsy said,robert jordan could tell they had been talking about him when he came in,hemingway
5775,5776,even the gypsy was not at ease,she is going to let you eat again,hemingway
5777,5778,robert jordan asked the gypsy,yes,hemingway
5779,5780,why not,the gypsy said,hemingway
5781,5782,it was a long way from the friendly joking they had together in the afternoon,the woman of pablo said nothing and went on blowing up the coals of the fire,hemingway
5783,5784,one called agustin says he dies of boredom above robert jordan said,that does not kill pablo said,hemingway
5785,5786,let him die a little,is there wine,hemingway
5787,5788,robert jordan asked the table at large leaning forward his hands on the table,there is little left pablo said sullenly,hemingway
5789,5790,robert jordan decided he had better look at the other three and try to see where he stood,in that case let me have a cup of water,hemingway
5791,5792,thou he called to the girl,bring me a cup of water,hemingway
5793,5794,the girl looked at the woman who said nothing and gave no sign of having heard then she went to a kettle containing water and dipped a cup full,she brought it to the table and put it down before him,hemingway
5795,5796,robert jordan smiled at her,at the same time he sucked in on his stomach muscles and swung a little to the left on his stool so that his pistol slipped around on his belt closer to where he wanted it,hemingway
5797,5798,he reached his hand down toward his hip pocket and pablo watched him,he knewthey all were watching him too but he watched only pablo,hemingway
5799,5800,his hand came up from the hip pocket with the leathercovered flask and he unscrewed the top and then lifting the cup drank half the water and poured very slowly from the flask into the cup,it is too strong for thee or i would give thee some he said to the girl and smiled at her again,hemingway
5801,5802,there is little left or i would offer some to thee he said to pablo,i do not like anis pablo said,hemingway
5803,5804,the acrid smell had carried across the table and he had picked out the one familiar component,good said robert jordan,hemingway
5805,5806,because there is very little left,what drink is that,hemingway
5807,5808,the gypsy asked,a medicine robert jordan said,hemingway
5809,5810,do you want to taste it,what is it for,hemingway
5811,5812,for everything robert jordan said,it cures everything,hemingway
5813,5814,if you have anything wrong this will cure it,let me taste it the gypsy said,hemingway
5815,5816,robert jordan pushed the cup toward him,it was a milky yellownowwith the water and he hoped the gypsy would not take more than a swallow,hemingway
5817,5818,there was very little of it left and one cup of it took the place of the evening papers of all the old evenings in cafes of all chestnut trees that would be in bloom nowin this month of the great slowhorses of the outer boulevards of book shops of kiosques and of galleries of the parc montsouris of the stade buffalo and of the butte chaumont of the guaranty trust company and the ile de la cite of foyots old hotel and of being able to read and relax in the evening of all the things he had enjoyed and forgotten and that came back to him when he tasted that opaque bitter tongue numbing brainwarming stomachwarming idea changing liquid alchemy,the gypsy made a face and handed the cup back,hemingway
5819,5820,it smells of anis but it is bitter as gall he said,it is better to be sick than have that medicine,hemingway
5821,5822,that is the wormwood robert jordan told him,in this the real absinthe there is wormwood,hemingway
5823,5824,its supposed to rot your brain out but i do not believe it,it only changes the ideas,hemingway
5825,5826,you should pour water into it very slowly a fewdrops at a time,but i poured it into the water,hemingway
5827,5828,what are you saying,pablo said angrily feeling the mockery,hemingway
5829,5830,explaining the medicine robert jordan told him and grinned,i bought it in madrid,hemingway
5831,5832,it was the last bottle and its lasted me three weeks,he took a big swallowof it and felt it coasting over his tongue in delicate anxsthesia,hemingway
5833,5834,he looked at pablo and grinned again,hows business,hemingway
5835,5836,he asked,pablo did not answer and robert jordan looked carefully at the other three men at the table,hemingway
5837,5838,one had a large flat face flat and brown as a serrano ham with a nose flattened and broken and the long thin russian cigarette projecting at an angle made the face look even flatter,this man had short gray hair and a gray stubble of beard and wore the usual black smock buttoned at the neck,hemingway
5839,5840,he looked down at the table when robert jordan looked at him but his eyes were steady and they did not blink,the other two were evidently brothers,hemingway
5841,5842,they looked much alike and were both short heavily built dark haired their hair growing lowon their foreheads darkeyed and brown,one had a scar across his forehead above his left eye and as he looked at them they looked back at him steadily,hemingway
5843,5844,one looked to be about twentysix or eight the other perhaps two years older,what are you looking at,hemingway
5845,5846,one brother the one with the scar asked,thee robert jordan said,hemingway
5847,5848,do you see anything rare,no said robert jordan,hemingway
5849,5850,have a cigarette,why not,hemingway
5851,5852,the brother said,he had not taken any before,hemingway
5853,5854,these are like the other had,he of the train,hemingway
5855,5856,were you at the train,we were all at the train the brother said quietly,hemingway
5857,5858,all except the old man,that is what we should do now pablo said,hemingway
5859,5860,another train,we can do that robert jordan said,hemingway
5861,5862,after the bridge,he could see that the wife of pablo had turned nowfrom the fire and was listening,hemingway
5863,5864,when he said the word bridge every one was quiet,after the bridge he said again deliberately and took a sip of the absinthe,hemingway
5865,5866,i might as well bring it on he thought,its coming anyway,hemingway
5867,5868,i do not go for the bridge pablo said looking down at the table,neither me nor my people,hemingway
5869,5870,robert jordan said nothing,he looked at anselmo and raised the cup,hemingway
5871,5872,then we shall do it alone old one he said and smiled,without this coward anselmo said,hemingway
5873,5874,what did you say,pablo spoke to the old man,hemingway
5875,5876,nothing for thee,i did not speak to thee anselmo told him,hemingway
5877,5878,robert jordan nowlooked past the table to where the wife of pablo was standing by the fire,she had said nothing yet nor given any sign,hemingway
5879,5880,but nowshe said something he could not hear to the girl and the girl rose from the cooking fire slipped along the wall opened the blanket that hung over the mouth of the cave and went out,i think it is going to come now robert jordan thought,hemingway
5881,5882,i believe this is it,i did not want it to be this way but this seems to be the way it is,hemingway
5883,5884,then we will do the bridge without thy aid robert jordan said to pablo,no pablo said and robert jordan watched his face sweat,hemingway
5885,5886,thou wilt blowno bridge here,no,hemingway
5887,5888,thou wilt blowno bridge pablo said heavily,and thou,hemingway
5889,5890,robert jordan spoke to the wife of pablo who was standing still and huge by the fire,she turned toward them and said i am for the bridge,hemingway
5891,5892,her face was lit by the fire and it was flushed and it shone warm and dark and handsome nowin the firelight as it was meant to be,what do you say,hemingway
5893,5894,pablo said to her and robert jordan sawthe betrayed look on his face and the sweat on his forehead as he turned his head,i am for the bridge and against thee the wife of pablo said,hemingway
5895,5896,nothing more,i am also for the bridge the man with the flat face and the broken nose said crushing the end of the cigarette on the table,hemingway
5897,5898,to me the bridge means nothing one of the brothers said,i am for the mujer of pablo,hemingway
5899,5900,equally said the other brother,equally the gypsy said,hemingway
5901,5902,robert jordan watched pablo and as he watched letting his right hand hang lower and lower ready if it should be necessary half hoping it would be feeling perhaps that were the simplest and easiest yet not wishing to spoil what had gone so well knowing howquickly all of a family all of a clan all of a band can turn against a stranger in a quarrel yet thinking what could be done with the hand were the simplest and best and surgically the most sound nowthat this had happened sawalso the wife of pablo standing there and watched her blush proudly and soundly and healthily as the allegiances were given,i am for the republic the woman of pablo said happily,hemingway
5903,5904,and the republic is the bridge,afterwards we will have time for other projects,hemingway
5905,5906,and thou pablo said bitterly,with your head of a seed bull and your heart of a whore,hemingway
5907,5908,thou thinkest there will be an afterwards from this bridge,thou hast an idea of that which will pass,hemingway
5909,5910,that which must pass the woman of pablo said,that which must pass will pass,hemingway
5911,5912,and it means nothing to thee to be hunted then like a beast after this thing from which we derive no profit,nor to die in it,hemingway
5913,5914,nothing the woman of pablo said,and do not try to frighten me coward,hemingway
5915,5916,coward pablo said bitterly,you treat a man as coward because he has a tactical sense,hemingway
5917,5918,because he can see the results of an idiocy in advance,it is not cowardly to knowwhat is foolish,hemingway
5919,5920,neither is it foolish to knowwhat is cowardly said anselmo unable to resist making the phrase,do you want to die,hemingway
5921,5922,pablo said to him seriously and robert jordan sawhowunrhetorical was the question,no,hemingway
5923,5924,then watch thy mouth,you talk too much about things you do not understand,hemingway
5925,5926,do not you see that this is serious,he said almost pitifully,hemingway
5927,5928,am i the only one who sees the seriousness of this,i believe so robert jordan thought,hemingway
5929,5930,old pablo old boy i believe so,except me,hemingway
5931,5932,you can see it and i see it and the woman read it in my hand but she does not see it yet,not yet she does not see it,hemingway
5933,5934,am i a leader for nothing,pablo asked,hemingway
5935,5936,i knowwhat i speak of,you others do not know,hemingway
5937,5938,this old man talks nonsense,he is an old man who is nothing but a messenger and a guide for foreigners,hemingway
5939,5940,this foreigner comes here to do a thing for the good of the foreigners,for his good we must be sacrificed,hemingway
5941,5942,i am for the good and the safety of all,safety the wife of pablo said,hemingway
5943,5944,there is no such thing as safety,there are so many seeking safety here nowthat they make a great danger,hemingway
5945,5946,in seeking safety nowyou lose all,she stood nowby the table with the big spoon in her hand,hemingway
5947,5948,there is safety pablo said,within the danger there is the safety of knowing what chances to take,hemingway
5949,5950,it is like the bullfighter who knowing what he is doing takes no chances and is safe,until he is gored the woman said bitterly,hemingway
5951,5952,howmany times have i heard matadors talk like that before they took a goring,howoften have i heard finito say that it is all knowledge and that the bull never gored the man rather the man gored himself on the horn of the bull,hemingway
5953,5954,always do they talk that way in their arrogance before a goring,afterwards we visit them in the clinic,hemingway
5955,5956,nowshe was mimicking a visit to a bedside hello old timer,hello she boomed,hemingway
5957,5958,then buenas compadre,howgoes it pilar,hemingway
5959,5960,imitating the weak voice of the wounded bullfighter,howdid this happen finito chico howdid this dirty accident occur to thee,hemingway
5961,5962,booming it out in her own voice,then talking weak and small it is nothing woman,hemingway
5963,5964,pilar it is nothing,it should not have happened,hemingway
5965,5966,i killed him very well you understand,nobody could have killed him better,hemingway
5967,5968,then having killed him exactly as i should and him absolutely dead swaying on his legs and ready to fall of his own weight i walked away from him with a certain amount of arrogance and much style and from the back he throws me this horn between the cheeks of my buttocks and it comes out of my liver,she commenced to laugh dropping the imitation of the almost effeminate bullfighters voice and booming again now,hemingway
5969,5970,you and your safety,did i live nine years with three of the worst paid matadors in the world not to learn about fear and about safety,hemingway
5971,5972,speak to me of anything but safety,and thee,hemingway
5973,5974,what illusions i put in thee and howthey have turned out,from one year of war thou has become lazy a drunkard and a coward,hemingway
5975,5976,in that way thou hast no right to speak pablo said,and less even before the people and a stranger,hemingway
5977,5978,in that way will i speak the wife of pablo went on,have you not heard,hemingway
5979,5980,do you still believe that you command here,yes pablo said,hemingway
5981,5982,here i command,not in joke the woman said,hemingway
5983,5984,here i command,have not you heard la gente,hemingway
5985,5986,here no one commands but me,you can stay if you wish and eat of the food and drink of the wine but not too bloody much and share in the work if thee wishes,hemingway
5987,5988,but here i command,i should shoot thee and the foreigner both pablo said suilenly,hemingway
5989,5990,try it the woman said,and see what happens,hemingway
5991,5992,a cup of water for me robert jordan said not taking his eyes from the man with his sullen heavy head and the woman standing proudly and confidently holding the big spoon as authoritatively as though it were a baton,maria called the woman of pablo and when the girl came in the door she said water for this comrade,hemingway
5993,5994,robert jordan reached for his flask and bringing the flask out as he brought it he loosened the pistol in the holster and swung it on top of his thigh,he poured a second absinthe into his cup and took the cup of water the girl brought him and commenced to drip it into the cup a little at a time,hemingway
5995,5996,the girl stood at his elbow watching him,outside the woman of pablo said to her gesturing with the spoon,hemingway
5997,5998,it is cold outside the girl said her cheek close to robert jordans watching what was happening in the cup where the liquor was clouding,maybe the woman of pablo said,hemingway
5999,6000,but in here it is too hot,then she said kindly it is not for long,hemingway
