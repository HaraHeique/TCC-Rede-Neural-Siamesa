men,they lie about it
because it means less to women father said,he said it was men invented virginity not women
father said it is like death only a state in which the others are left and i said but to believe it does not matter and he said that is what is so sad about anything not only virginity and i said why could not it have been me and not her who is unvirgin and he said that is why that is sad too nothing is even worth the changing of it and shreve said if he is got better sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts and i said did you ever have a sister,did you
did you,spoade was in the middle of them like a terrapin in a street full of scuttering dead leaves his collar about his ears moving at his customary unhurried walk
he was from south carolina a senior,it was his club is boast that he never ran for chapel and had never got there on time and had never been absent in four years and had never made either chapel or first lecture with a shirt on his back and socks on his feet
about ten oclock he had come in thompson is get two cups of coffee sit down and take his socks out of his pocket and remove his shoes and put them on while the coffee cooled,about noon you had see him with a shirt and collar on like anybody else
the others passed him running but he never increased his pace at all,after a while the quad was empty
a sparrow slanted across the sunlight onto the window ledge and cocked his head at me,his eye was round and bright
first he had watch me with one eye then flick,and it would be the other one his throat pumping faster than any pulse
the hour began to strike,the sparrow quit swapping eyes and watched me steadily with the same one until the chimes ceased as if he were listening too
then he flicked off the ledge and was gone,it was a while before the last stroke ceased vibrating
it stayed in the air more felt than heard for a long time,like all the bells that ever rang still ringing in the long dying lightrays and jesus and saint francis talking about his sister
because if it were just to hell if that were all of it,finished
if things just finished themselves,nobody else there but her and me
if we could just have done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us,i have committed incest i said father it was i it was not dalton ames and when he put dalton ames
dalton ames,dalton ames
when he put the pistol in my hand i did not,that is why i did not
he would be there and she would and i would,dalton ames
dalton ames,dalton ames
if we could have just done something so dreadful and father said that is sad too people cannot do anything that dreadful they cannot do anything very dreadful at all they cannot even remember tomorrow what seemed dreadful today and i said you can shirk all things and he said ah can you,and i will look down and see my murmuring bones and the deep water like wind like a roof of wind and after a long time they cannot distinguish even bones upon the lonely and inviolate sand
until on the day when he says rise only the flatiron would come floating up,it is not when you realise that nothing can help youreligion pride anythingit is when you realise that you dont need any aid
dalton ames,dalton ames
dalton ames,if i could have been his mother lying with open body lifted laughing holding his father with my hand refraining seeing watching him die before he lived
one minute she was standing in the door i went to the dresser and took up the watch with the face still down,i tapped the crystal on the corner of the dresser and caught the fragments of glass in my hand and put them into the ashtray and twisted the hands off and put them in the tray
the watch ticked on,i turned the face up the blank dial with little wheels clicking and click ing behind it not knowing any better
jesus walking on galilee and washington not telling lies,father brought back a watchcharm from the saint louis fair to jason a tiny opera glass into which you squinted with one eye and saw a skyscraper a ferris wheel all spidery niagara falls on a pinhead
there was a red smear on the dial,when i saw it my thumb began to smart
i put the watch down and went into shreve is room and got the iodine and painted the cut,i cleaned the rest of the glass out of the rim with a towel
i laid out two suits of underwear with socks shirts collars and ties and packed my trunk,i put in everything except my new suit and an old one and two pairs of shoes and two hats and my books
i carried the books into the sittingroom and stacked them on the table the ones i had brought from home and the ones father said it used to be a gentleman was known by his books nowadays he is known by the ones he has not returned and locked the trunk and addressed it,the quarter hour sounded
i stopped and listened to it until the chimes ceased,i bathed and shaved
the water made my finger smart a little so i painted it again,i put on my new suit and put my watch on and packed the other suit and the accessories and my razor and brushes in my hand bag and folded the trunk key into a sheet of paper and put it in an envelope and addressed it to father and wrote the two notes and sealed them
the shadow had not quite cleared the stoop,i stopped inside the door watching the shadow move
it moved almost perceptibly creeping back inside the door driving the shadow back into the door,only she was running already when i heard it
in the mirror she was running before i knew what it was,that quick her train caught up over her arm she ran out of the mirror like a cloud her veil swirling in long glints her heels brittle and fast clutch ing her dress onto her shoulder with the other hand run ning out of the mirror the smells roses roses the voice that breathed oer eden
then she was across the porch i could not hear her heels then in the moonlight like a cloud the floating shadow of the veil running across the grass into the bellowing,she ran out of her dress clutching her bridal running into the bellowing where tp in the dew whooey sassprilluh benjy under the box bellowing
father had a vshaped silver cuirass on his running chest shreve said well you did not,is it a wedding or a wake
i could not make it i said,not with all that primping
what is the matter,you think this was sunday
i reckon the police wont get me for wearing my new suit one time i said,i was thinking about the square students
they will think you go to harvard,have you got too proud to at tend classes too
i am going to eat first,the shadow on the stoop was gone
i stepped into sunlight finding my shadow again,i walked down the steps just ahead of it
the half hour went,then the chimes ceased and died away
deacon was not at the postoffice either,i stamped the two envelopes and mailed the one to father and put shreve is in my inside pocket and then i remembered where i had last seen the deacon
it was on decoration day in a g,uniform in the middle of the parade
if you waited long enough on any corner you would see him in whatever parade came along,the one before was on columbus or garibaldi is or somebody is birthday
he was in the street sweepers section in a stovepipe hat carrying a two inch italian flag smoking a cigar among the brooms and scoops,but the last time was the g
one because shreve said there now,just look at what your grandpa did to that poor old nigger
yes i said,now he can spend day after day marching in parades
if it had not been for my grandfather he had have to work like whitefolks,i did not see him anywhere
eat now,it is very good pilar fernando said all dignity intact
thank you said the woman,thank you and thank you again
are you angry at me,fernando asked
no,eat
go ahead and eat,i will said fernando
thank you,robert jordan looked at maria and her shoulders started shaking again and she looked away
fernando ate steadily a proud and dignified expression on his face the dignity of which could not be affected even by the huge spoon that he was using or the slight dripping of juice from the stewwhich ran from the corners of his mouth,do you like the food
the woman of pablo asked him,yes pilar he said with his mouth full
it is the same as usual,robert jordan felt marias hand on his arm and felt her fingers tighten with delight
it is for that that you like it,the woman asked fernando
yes she said,i see
the stew as usual,como siempre
things are bad in the north as usual,an offensive here as usual
that troops come to hunt us out as usual,you could serve as a monument to as usual
but the last two are only rumors pilar,spain the woman of pablo said bitterly
then turned to robert jordan,do they have people such as this in other countries
there are no other countries like spain robert jordan said politely,you are right fernando said
there is no other country in the world like spain,hast thou ever seen any other country
the woman asked him,nay said fernando
nor do i wish to,you see
the woman of pablo said to robert jordan,fernandito maria said to him
tell us of the time thee went to valencia i did not like valencia,why
maria asked and pressed robert jordans arm again,why did thee not like it
the people had no manners and i could not understand them,all they did was shout che at one another
could they understand thee,maria asked
they pretended not to fernando said,and what did thee there
i left without even seeing the sea fernando said,i did not like the people
oh get out of here you old maid the woman of pablo said,get out of here before you make me sick
in valencia i had the best time of my life,vamos
valencia,do not talk to me of valencia
what did thee there,maria asked
the woman of pablo sat down at the table with a bowl of coffee a piece of bread and a bowl of the stew,que
what did we there,i was there when finito had a contract for three fights at the feria
never have i seen so many people,never have i seen cafes so crowded
for hours it would be impossible to get a seat and it was impossible to board the tram cars,in valencia there was movement all day and all night
but what did you do,maria asked
all things the woman said,we went to the beach and lay in the water and boats with sails were hauled up out of the sea by oxen
the oxen driven to the water until they must swim then harnessed to the boats and when they found their feet staggering up the sand,ten yokes of oxen dragging a boat with sails out of the sea in the morning with the line of the small waves breaking on the beach
that is valencia,but what did thee besides watch oxen
we ate in pavilions on the sand,pastries made of cooked and shredded fish and red and green peppers and small nuts like grains of rice
pastries delicate and flaky and the fish of a richness that was incredible,prawns fresh from the sea sprinkled with lime juice
they were pink and sweet and there were four bites to a prawn,of those we ate many
then we ate paella with fresh sea food clams in their shells mussels crayfish and small eels,then we ate even smaller eels alone cooked in oil and as tiny as bean sprouts and curled in all directions and so tender they disappeared in the mouth without chewing
all the time drinking a white wine cold light and good at thirty centimos the bottle,and for an end melon
that is the home of the melon,the melon of castile is better fernando said
que va said the woman of pablo,the melon of castile is for self abuse
the melon of valencia for eating,when i think of those melons long as ones arm green like the sea and crisp and juicy to cut and sweeter than the early morning in summer
aye when i think of those smallest eels tiny delicate and in mounds on the plate,also the beer in pitchers all through the afternoon the beer sweating in its coldness in pitchers the size of water jugs
and what did thee when not eating nor drinking,we made love in the room with the strip wood blinds hanging over the balcony and a breeze through the opening of the top of the door which turned on hinges
we made love there the room dark in the day time from the hanging blinds and from the streets there was the scent of the flower market and the smell of burned powder from the firecrackers of the traca that ran though the streets exploding each noon during the feria,it was a line of fireworks that ran through all the city the firecrackers linked together and the explosions running along on poles and wires of the tramways exploding with great noise and a jumping from pole to pole with a sharpness and a cracking of explosion you could not believe
we made love and then sent for another pitcher of beer with the drops of its coldness on the glass and when the girl brought it i took it from the door and i placed the coldness of the pitcher against the back of finito as he lay now asleep not having wakened when the beer was brought and he said no pilar,no woman let me sleep
would not that have been the best way to play it,he could stop of course
he could stop the madness right here,he was not going to win pegeen back by going on to dial asa is number yet he dialed it
he was not trying to win her back,there was no winning her back
no he simply would not be outmaneuvered and outwitted by a secondrate actor who held sway with the secondrate actress who was his wife over a regional theater in the middle of nowhere,the staplefords could not make it on the stage in new york they could not make it in film in california so they are making great dramatic art he thought out beyond the corruptions of the commercial world
no he would not be defeated by these two mediocrities,he would not be a boy overcome by her parents
the phone rang only once before asa answered and said hello,just how did it benefit you axler began seething shouting resentfully to turn her against me
you could not stand that she was a lesbian in the first place,that is what she saidneither you nor carol could bear it
you were appalled when she told you,well with me she had relinquished all that with me she had opened herself to a new way of lifeand was happy
you never saw the two of us together,pegeen and i were happy
but instead of being grateful to me you persuade her to pick up and leave,even her going back to being a lesbian was preferable to her being with me
why,why
explain this to me please,first simon you must calm down
i wo not listen to a tirade,do you have some special dislike of me dating back to the beginning
is there envy here asa or revenge perhaps or jealousy,what harm have i done her
i am sixtysix i have not been working my spine is a problemwhere is the horror in that,where is the threat to your daughter in that
did it prevent me from offering her anything she wanted,i gave pegeen everything i possibly could
i tried to satisfy her in every conceivable way,i am sure you did
she said as much to carol and me,no one could fault you for your generosity and no one has
you know she is left me,i do now
you did not before,no
i do not believe you asa,pegeen does what she wants to do
she is done that all her life,pegeen did what you wanted her to do
i am well within my rights as a father to be concerned about a daughter and give counsel to her,i would be remiss if i did not
but how could you give counsel when you knew nothing about what was going on between us,all you had in your head was a vision of me with all my renown with all my success stealing away what was rightfully yours
it was not fair asa was it that i should have pegeen too,should not he have played that line for a laugh instead of delivering it in a fit of anger
should not he have been quietly sardonic as though it were a deliberately needling overstatement rather than his sounding out of his mind,oh play it however you like axler told himself
probably you are playing it for laughs anyway without your even knowing it,he detested his tears but he was all at once crying again crying from the shame and the loss and the rage all tangled together and so he hung up on the call to asa that he never should have made in the first place
because it was he finally who was responsible for what had happened,yes he had tried to satisfy her in every imaginable way and so idiotically he had introduced tracy into their life and undone everything
but then how could he have foreseen that,tracy was party to a game a beguiling sex game of the kind that any number of couples play for diversion and excitement
how could he foresee a pickup at the bar would end with his losing pegeen for good,would someone smarter have known better
or was this a continuation of the turn his luck had taken playing prospero and macbeth,was all of this owing to stupidity or was it just his way of digging himself one layer deeper down into the final demise
and who was this tracy,the new salesgirl at a rural antique shop
a lonesome drunk at a country inn,who was she compared with him
this was impossible,how could he be overthrown for tracy
how could he be defeated by asa,was pegeen leaving him for tracy because subterraneanly it hurled his little girl back into papa is arms
and suppose she was not leaving him for tracy,or leaving him because of her family is objections
then what had made him repugnant to her,why was he suddenly taboo
he carried the gun into pegeen is study and stood there looking at the room that she had stripped of victoria is wallpaper and then painted a shade of peach the room that she had made into hers just as he holding nothing back had invited her to make him into hers,he suppressed an urge to fire a shot into the back of her desk chair and sat in it instead
he saw for the first time that all the books she had brought from home had been removed from the bookcase beside the desk,when did she empty those shelves
how far back did the decision to leave him go,had it been there all along even while she was stripping these walls
now he suppressed the urge to fire the gun into the bookcase,instead he ran his hand over the empty shelves that had housed her books and tried in vain to think of what he could have done differently over all these months that would have made her want to stay
after what must have been at least an hour he decided not to be found dead in pegeen is room in pegeen is chair,the culprit was not pegeen
the failures were his as was the bewildering biography on which he was impaled,when long after calling asa sometime around midnight having retreated back to the attic several hours beforehe could not pull the trigger even after he had gone so far as to place the barrel of the gun inside his mouth he challenged himself to remember tiny sybil van buren that conventional suburban housewife weighing less than a hundred pounds who finished what she set out to do who took on the gruesome role of a murderer and succeeded at it
yes he thought if she could summon up the force to do something so terrible to the husband who was her demon then i can at least do this to myself,he imagined the steeliness that went into her carrying her plan to the brutal end the ruthless madness that she had mobilized in leaving the two small children at home her driving singlemindedly to the estranged husband is house her mounting the stairs ringing the bell raising the rifle and when he opened the door without hesitation her firing twice at pointblank rangeif she could do that i can do this
sybil van buren became the benchmark of courage,he repeated to himself the inspiring formula to action as though a simple word or two could get him to accomplish the most unreal of all things if she could do that i can do this if she could do that
until finally it occurred to him to pretend that he was committing suicide in a play,in a play by chekhov
what could be more fitting,it would constitute his return to acting and preposterous disgraced feeble little being that he was a lesbian is thirteen month mistake it would take everything in him to get the job done
to succeed one last time to make the imagined real he would have to pretend that the attic was a theater and that he was konstantin gavrilovich treplev in the concluding scene of the seagull,in his midtwenties when as a theatrical prodigy he accomplished everything he tried and achieved everything he wanted he had played the part of chekhov is aspiring young writer who feels a failure at everything desperate with defeat at work and love
it was in an actors studio broadway production of the seagull and it marked his first big new york success making him the most promising young actor of the season full of certainty and a sense of singularity and leading to every unforeseeable contingency,if she could do that i can do this
there was a note of eight words found alongside him when his body was discovered on the floor of the attic by the cleaning woman later that week,the fact is konstantin gavrilovich has shot himself
it was the final line spoken in the seagull,he had brought it off the well established stage star once so widely heralded for his force as an actor whom in his heyday people would flock to the theater to see
