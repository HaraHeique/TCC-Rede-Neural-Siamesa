in all the plaza struck me as a place where he would not lack for companionship and i wa hope that after we had look around the idea of move might appeal to him,they have been on an indianapoli bank
i wa afraid that if he tri much longer to hang on by himself in the elizabeth apart he might liter die there of loneli,i had alreadi lost thirteen point all becaus she had to come hell in there at twelv worri me about that letter
hi meal when he even sat down and ate them seem to consist mostli of boil hot dog and heinz bake bean and when i phone in the middl of the day i often found him asleep or in tear,we look a littl asid at one anoth
it wa clear to me when i arriv at the apart that day that he had been sit there cri by himself,dilsey said
