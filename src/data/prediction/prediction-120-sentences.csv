he insisted on washing his underclothes and his socks in the bathroom rather than parting with the few quarters that it cost to use the washerdryer in the basement laundry room every time i came to see him there were his grayish misshapen things draped over wire hangers on the shower rod and the towel racks,tricky visibly moved reverend i thank you for that tribute
though he prided himself on being nattily dressed and always enjoyed putting on a nicely tailored new sports jacket or a threepiece hickeyfreeman suit enjoyed it particularly when he d bought it at an endofseason sale he had taken to cutting corners on whatever wasn t visible to anyone else,you know something doc he said swinging suddenly with no lack of daring into the fast lane going south my old man s in his grave now without his four front teeth
his pajamas and handkerchiefs like his underwear and socks looked as though they hadn t been replaced since my mother s death,you coward she moaned as she went rushing off to the coffee shop you weakling she wept as she carried the phone book into the booth at the back of the store you selfish heartless as she drew her finger down the list of physicians in the yellow pages of the directory imagining them one after another saying to her you can not expect me young lady to save your life and seeing herself dragging from one office to another humiliated ignored and abused
when i got to his apartment that the inadvertent visit to my mother s quickly excused myself and went off to the toilet,nothing
first i d missed a turnoff and now in the bathroom i was taking another few minutes to rehearse for a final time the best way to tell him about the tumor,just pike this and then at the top of his voice he would read from the newspaper something that harry truman had done which just infuriated him
while i stood over the bowl his undergarments hung all around me like remnants strung out by a farmer to scare the birds away,his name was kurtz and even though he had the kind of bad skin roy didn t exactly like to have to look at at mealtime he often found himself inviting him to come to visit in liberty center after they all got sprung from this prison and taste his mom s cooking
on the open shelves above the toilet where there was an assortment of prescription drugs as well as his polident vaseline and ascriptin his boxes of tissues qtips and absorbent cotton i spotted the shaving mug that had once been my grandfather s in it my father kept his razor and a tube of shaving cream,hey having a gi
the mug was pale blue porcelain a delicate floral design enclosed a wide white panel at the front and inside the panel the name s,boy no wonder you and ellie are friends
roth and the date were inscribed in faded gold gothic lettering,how
the mug was our one family heirloom as far as i knew aside from a handful of antique snapshots the only thing tangible that anyone had cared to save from the immigrant years in newark,they very well might
i had been intrigued by it ever since my grandfather had died a month short of my seventh birthday and it made its way into our newark bathroom back when my father was still shaving with a bristle brush and shaving soap,vice president that he had secretly entered walter reed last night to have the sweat glands removed from his hip
sender roth had been a remote mysterious presence to me as a small boy an elongated man with an undersized forebear whom my own skeleton most about whom all i knew was that he smoked all day long spoke only yiddish and wasn t much given to fondling the american grandchildren when we all showed up with our parents on sundays,sometimes i said
after his death the shaving mug in our bathroom brought him much more fully to life for me not as a grandfather but even more interestingly then as an ordinary man among men a customer of a barbershop where his mug was kept on a shelf with the mugs of the other neighborhood immigrants,going
it reassured me as a child to think that in that household where according to all reports there was never a penny to spare a dime was set aside every week for him to go to the barbershop and get his sabbath shave,let s try a scientific experiment
my grandfather roth had studied to be a rabbi in polish galicia in a small town not far from lemberg but when he arrived in america alone in without his wife and his three sons my uncles charlie morris and ed he took a job in a hat factory to earn the money to bring his family over and worked there more or less most of his life,epstein rolled over and looked to michael s bed pinpoints of light gleamed in the bov s head he was awake and wearing the epstein nose chin and brow
there were seven children born between and six sons and a daughter and all but the last two of the boys and the one girl left school after the eighth grade to find jobs to help support the family,tzuref removed eli s letter from his pants pocket
the shaving mug inscribed s,bassart
roth had seemed to free my only momentarily if only for those few minutes he quietly sat being shaved in the barber s chair late on a friday the dour exigencies that had trapped him and that i imagined accounted for his austere uncommunicative nature,is nt that a good boy
his mug emitted the aura of an archaeological find an artifact signaling an unexpected level of cultural refinement an astonishing superfluity in an otherwise cramped and obstructed our ordinary little newark bathroom it had the impact on me of a greek vase depicting the mythic origins of the race,i returned to my chair and sat back as mr
by what amazed me about it was that my father hadn t thrown it out or given it away,they are another breed of human being entirely
over the years when it was within his power he had gotten rid of just about everything useless to which any of us might have been thought to have a sentimental attachment,how could she help it if her parents were strict
though these seizures of largess were on the whole admirably motivated they sometimes lacked sensitivity to innate property rights,who like the monkey had ever happened to me beforeor will again
so eager was he to answer the need real or imagined of the recipient that he did not always think about the effect of his impulsiveness on the unwitting donor,at the hospital they pushed her stretcher into a cubicle of its own and when my father who had followed the ambulance in his car went in by himself to look at her he could not stand to see what he saw and so he ran
my twovolume stamp collection for instance studiously acquired by me throughout my late grade school collection partially inspired by the example of the country s most famous philatelist franklin delano roosevelt and underwritten with virtually all my gave away to a greatnephew of his the year i went off to college,i told the doctor i insisted this not a complainer there must be something wrong and they told us there was nothing wrong but i insisted and insisted and eventually they found out i was right
i didn t know this until ten years later when i was thinking of drawing on my scholarly discoveries as a boy stamp collector for an episode in a piece of fiction and went down to my parents house in moorestown to get the albums out of the attic,alex please i heard a definite clink
it was only after i had searched thoroughly but in vain through the cartons i d stored there that my mother not until we were off alone how they had come to disappear,earl i learned later was in the carpet business and apparently he was trying to figure how much money he would make if the hotel pierre favored him with a sale
she assured me that she had tried to stop him that she had told him that my stamps weren t his to dispose of but he wouldn t listen,she d had a straight average worked after school at the library and still had time for extracurricular activities spanish club citizenship club the liberty bell advertising manager and a social life
he told her that i was grown up away at college didn t use the stamps anymore whereas chickie his greatnephew could bring them with him to school et cetera et cetera et cetera,so sound
i suppose i could have found out if any part of my collection even existed any longer by contacting relative who was virtually a stranger to me and by then a young married i decided to let the whole thing drop,that astonished me too
i was terrifically irritated to hear what he had when i remembered how much of my childhood had gone into that collection genuinely as it was so long ago that he had done it and as i had rather more difficult problems to deal with i was in the midst of an acrimonious marital separation i said nothing to him,the rabbi continued
and even if i had been inclined to it would have been no easier for me to criticize him to his face at twentyeight than it had been at eighteen or eight since his most blatantly thoughtless acts were invariably ignited by this spontaneous impulse to support to assist to rescue to save prompted by the conviction that what he was away my stamps for generous helpful and morally or educationally efficacious,charlie was no good even as a kid my father said
i believe another motive was operating in harder to fathom and we came back from burying my mother in may of and even as the apartment began filling up with family and friends he disappeared into the bedroom and started emptying her bureau drawers and sorting through the clothes in her closet,to my tollhouse cookie and my glass of milk home to my nice clean bed
i was still at the door with my brother welcoming the mourners who d followed us back from the cemetery and so i wouldn t right off have known what he was up to had not my mother s sister millie rushed out of the bedroom and down the hallway calling for help,they were not cups but pitchers
the bed was already strewn with dresses coats skirts and blouses pulled from the closet and he was now busily chucking things from a corner of her lowest bureau drawer into a plastic garbage bag,upper
i put my hand on his shoulder and gripped it forcefully,this is erect severehead with a cogent news analysis from the nation s capital a hushed hush pervades the corridors of power
people are here for you i said they want to see you to talk to what good is this stuff anymore,you re a smart boy you ll play it safe
it s no good to me hanging here,oh am i
this stuff can go to jewish s in mint stop stop,he was draped not only with his own clothing but also with the greenish tweed suit the batiste shirt and under each arm a shoe
there s time for all this later,and my mother comes into the kitchen and gives me her patient eternal allknowing sphinxlook
we ll do it together later,behind him i saw fishbein and halpern both in starched khakis both carrying ditty bags like grossbart s
stop throwing things out i said,are you ready
pull yourself together,this was not the axiom he wanted
he didn t appear to be either in a daze or in the throes of a hysterical was simply doing what he had done all his life the next difficult job,i have two sacks
thirty minutes before we had buried her body now to dispose of her things,thank you
i ushered him out of the bedroom and once among the guests who had come to offer condolences he immediately began talking away assuring everyone that he was fine,salud old one she said to him
i returned to the bedroom to remove from the garbage bag the pile of mementos that he d already discarded and that my mother had neatly and carefully saved over the them in a tiny brown envelope my phi beta kappa key which she had coveted a collection of programs to family graduation exercises birthday cards from my brother and me a handful of telegrams announcing good news clippings friends had sent her about me and my books specially prized snapshots of her two grandsons as small boys,i never notice when i eat by myself
they were all items for which my father could imagine no function now that she who had treasured them was gone the sentimental keepsakes of someone whose sentiments had been snuffed out forever two nights earlier at a seafood restaurant where as was their custom they had gone with friends for sunday night dinner,i will she said
my mother had just been served clam chowder a favorite dish of hers to everyone s surprise she had announced i don t want this soup and those were her last moment later she was dead of a massive coronary,no my lieutenantcolonel andrés said
it was my father s primitivism that stunned me,the prado is nt wasting
standing all alone emptying her drawers and her closets he seemed driven by some instinct that might be natural to a wild beast or an aboriginal tribesman but ran counter to just about every mourning rite that had evolved in civilized societies to mitigate the sense of loss among those who survive the death of a loved one,david sat on the tall stool by catherine and she looked in the mirror and watched marita go out of the room
yet there was also something almost admirable in this pitilessly realistic determination to acknowledge instantaneously that he was now an old man living alone and that symbolic relics were no substitute for the real companion of fiftyfive years,yes pablo said
it seemed to me that it was not out of fear of her things and their ghostlike power that he wanted to rid the apartment of them without bury them now because he refused to sidestep the most brutal of all facts,he still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and the old man stabbed him in his left eye
never in his life as far as i knew had he been one to try to elude the force of a dreadful blow and yet as i later learned on the evening of her death he had fled from her corpse,but i learn fast
this occurred not at the restaurant where she had in fact died but at the hospital where she was declared dead after the paramedics had worked in vain to revive her on the ambulance ride from the restaurant to the emergency room,i did nt know they d come she said
at the hospital they pushed her stretcher into a cubicle of its own and when my father who had followed the ambulance in his car went in by himself to look at her he could not stand to see what he saw and so he ran,he felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down
it was months before he could speak about this to anyone and when he did it wasn t to me or to my brother but to claire who as a woman could grant him the womanly absolution he required to begin to shed his shame,was it jean
though he wasn t himself equipped to account for why he d run away like that i wondered if it hadn t something to do with his realizing that he might have contributed to the heart attack by pushing my mother that afternoon to walk beyond her endurance,the boy brought him the éclaireur de nice and he read it while he waited
she had been suffering for some time from severe shortness of breath and unknown to me from angina during the previous winter there had also been a long siege of arthritic pain that had demoralized her terribly,they laughed again
that winter she d had all she could do just to sit up comfortably in a chair but on the day she died because the may weather was so beautiful and she was finally out of doors getting some exercise they d walked as far as the drugstore three very long city blocks away and then because he insisted it would be good for her they d also walked all the way home,it might have been something worse
according to aunt my mother had phoned before they went out for the the time they d reached the drugstore she was already hopelessly exhausted,not yet primitivo said
i didn t think i could get back she d reported to my aunt but instead of calling a taxi or waiting for a bus they had rested a little on a nearby bench and then he d got her up on her feet for the return trek,it is close enough
you know your father my aunt had said to me,get me some water in this jake
he told her she could do it she had spent the rest of the afternoon on the bed trying to recover enough strength to go out to dinner,i know now anyway he thought
as it happened only an hour or so before they d left for their walk i d made my customary sunday call from england and told her playfully that i expected her to go a mile with me down the country road outside my house when she and my father came to visit that summer,yesterday it was all gone and everything was over and now here i am
she replied i don t know if it ll be a mile dear but i ll try she was sounding bright and confident for the first time in months and could well have gone off that afternoon hoping to begin to prepare herself for our summer stroll,but the light is behind us
in fact when i arrived back in america the next day and took a taxi from kennedy directly over to elizabeth my father s first words to me were well she won t be taking that walk phil he was in her reclining chair his body decrepit his face batteredlooking and drained of all life,think of it that way
i thought not incorrectly as it turned out this is what he will look like when he is dead my brother sandy and his wife helen had arrived earlier in the day from chicago and were at the apartment when i got there,me voy
sandy had already been to the funeral home to arrange for the burial the next day,all right davie she said
before he d gone my father had spoken on the phone to the elderly funeral director a man with whom my mother had attended elizabeth s battin high around the end of the first world war,maybe it was like those dreams
my father in tears had told him take care of her body take good care of it higgins then for the rest of the day he went on weeping there in that chair in which she would stretch out after supper and try to get some relief from her arthritis while they watched the news together,the girl can cook a little
she ordered new england clam chowder he told me as i kneeled beside him still in my coat and holding his hand and i ordered manhattan,let them think about it
when it came she said i don t want this soup i said take ll switch but she was gone,it is curious
just slumped forward,i put on my pajamas and got into bed
didn t even fall,man
made no trouble for anyone,i had them made in nice
my father was a more difficult personality far less seductive and less malleable too bluntly resisting points of view that diverged only slightly from his own reigning biases was in fact one of his most rigorously unthinking activities,you and your clippings
still kneeling before him with his hand in mine i understood just how much we were going to have to help i couldn t understand was how we were going to get through to him,why
his obsessive stubborn very nearly driven my mother to a breakdown in her final years since his retirement at the age of sixtythree her once spirited housewifely independence had been all but extinguished by his anxious overbearing bossiness,catherine hill
for years he had believed he was married to perfection and for years he wasn t far mother was one of those devoted daughters of jewish immigrants who raised housekeeping in america to a great art,did nt i tell you marita
don t talk to anyone in my family about saw cleaning in its heyday,i like you the way you are now
but then my father retired from one of the metropolitan life s big south jersey offices where he d been managing a staff of fiftytwo people and the efficient clearcut division of labor that had done so much to define their marriage as a success gradually began to be him,i says
he had nothing to do and she had everything to that wouldn t do,i said he gave us the gift to raise our voices in his undying praise because i said there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner than over a hundred that never sinned
you know what i am now he told me sadly on his sixtyfifth birthday,there was a fire in the house rising and falling with roskus sitting black against it
i m bessie s husband and by neither temperament nor training was he suited to be that alone,git now
so after a couple of years of volunteer at the va,caddy said
hospital in east orange with jewish relief groups and the red even of working as an underling for a friend who owned a hardware store he settled down to become bessie s my mother happened not to need a boss having been her own since her singlehanded establishment of a firstclass domesticmanagement and mothering company back in when my brother was born,did you take him down to the branch
just the summer before her death during a weekend visit to connecticut when we two were alone having a cup of tea in the kitchen she had announced that she was thinking of getting a divorce,i reckon he s all right he said
to hear the word divorce from my mother s lips astonished me almost as much as it would have if she had uttered an obscenity,a dog s voice carries further than a train in the darkness anyway
but then the inmost intertwining of mother and father s life together the difficulties and disappointments and enduring strains remain mysterious really forever perhaps particularly if you grew up as a good boy in a secure wellordered simultaneously as a good girl,how could i i says
people don t always realize what good girls we grew up as too the little sons suckled and gurgled by mothers as adroit as my own in the skills of nurturing domesticity,i wont
for a very long and impressionable time the male who s not around all day remains much more remote and mythological than the palpable woman of wizardly proficiency anchored firmly during the decades when i was young in the odorous kitchen where her jurisdiction was absolute and her authority divine,there are lots of women in this world no better than her i says
but ma i said it s late for a divorce no,jason was crying
you re seventysix but she was crying quite pitifully already,like i say if he had to sell something to send quentin to harvard we d all been a dam sight better off if he d sold that sideboard and bought himself a onearmed strait jacket with part of the money
that astonished me too,dewey dell and vardaman and pa better walk across on the bridge cash says
he doesn t listen to what i say she said,taint any girl cash said
he interrupts all the time to talk about something else,yesterday there were just four i say
when we re out that s the worst,let s go around to the front
then he won t let me speak at all,he was in the street sweepers section in a stovepipe hat carrying a two inch italian flag smoking a cigar among the brooms and scoops
if i start to he just shuts me up,then they played in the branch
in front of everyone,it s just the race
as though i don t exist tell him not to do it i said,she looked at me and i looked at her again and said how old are you
it wouldn t make any difference then tell him a second time and if it still doesn t work get up and say i m going home and go oh darling i couldn t,well i reckon i aint no call to expect no more of him than of his mangrowed brothers
no i couldn t embarrass him like that,i cant get no cooking done with all that racket
not with company but you tell me he embarrasses you when you re with company that s different,are you the doctor
he s not like me,shreve s letter crackled through the cloth and i took it out and examined the address and put it in my side pocket
he couldn t take it philip,i was a kid then
he would crumble up,father brought caddy to the fire
it would kill him three months after her death in august i came down from connecticut to take him to the jewish federation plaza in west orange where we were to look at the living accommodations for retired and elderly people,how much
the plaza had been recommended to us by an old newark friend of my brother s a new jersey attorney on the federation s board of directors,so we went up the street toward the square and he said we better take cash to the doctor first
he had said he might be able to help my father get an apartment without too long a delay if my father was interested,hush
the plaza residents lived in twoand threeroom apartments of their own but the round of life itself was strongly communal each evening they ate together in a dining room where their meals were prepared for them and they had easy access to all the group activities at the flourishing y next door,father turned toward the steps
west orange was still one of newark s pleasant suburbs and the plaza as it was described to me was situated back on a green hillside overlooking a main thoroughfare a few minutes walk from a shopping center and also from the temple b nai abraham which like the y had been transplanted from decaying newark and served the elderly as a cultural center as well as a synagogue,i ll let you off this time
in all the plaza struck me as a place where he would not lack for companionship and i was hoping that after we had looked around the idea of moving might appeal to him,have nt you got one
i was afraid that if he tried much longer to hang on by himself in the elizabeth apartment he might literally die there of loneliness,what about jewel
his meals when he even sat down and ate them seemed to consist mostly of boiled hot dogs and heinz baked beans and when i phoned in the middle of the day i often found him asleep or in tears,it aint always the safe things in this world that a fellow
it was clear to me when i arrived at the apartment that day that he had been sitting there crying by himself,and then spoade said they were going somewhere would not be back until late and mrs bland would need another cavalier
he could have been crying since he d got up for all i knew he could have been crying all night long,one part of you knowed it was just water the same thing that had been running under this same bridge for a long time yet when them logs would come spewing up outen it you were not surprised like they was a part of water of the waiting and the threat
he d spent a few weeks with us in connecticut in june and then again in july and had seemed in that time to have gotten on top of the worst of his grief but now that he was back in the apartment without my mother he was hopelessly bereft all over again,you watch out for him
though outside it was a beautiful august day he was sitting there with the shades down and no lights on,it was gray with his eyes closed and a long swipe of mud across his face
i noticed that his clothes while clean didn t quite match as if getting out of bed he d pulled on whatever came to hand first,wont we get to jefferson tomorrow
