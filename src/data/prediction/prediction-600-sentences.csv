with the son he went to all that troubl to get lie right there behind him in the cabin he would have to taunt the grandfath into kill first him and then the child too,it wa as if he were not think of sleep of whether she would be asleep or not

that bridg wont stand a whole lot water i said,if he notic thought at all he must have said my god how long
i say,what for
or mayb it wa vaniti the stupid vaniti of a man,and when he thought of that other person that seem to exist somewher in physic dark itself it seem to him that what he now saw by daylight wa a phantom of someon whom the night sister had murder and which now move purposeless about the scene of old peac rob even of the power of lament
we return to the river,i just never want to be beholden to none except her flesh and blood
becaus he wa still innoc,do you have to do it
she now wore a fade mother hubbard and a sunbonnet and she carri a cedar bucket,they could not see the two dog at all onli the steadi furrow of the sedg where invis the dog quarter the slope until one of them flung up hi head to look back

again stop she did not even look at him have alreadi look at him allse like when she had set the coffe and the pie on the counter,you don t bother me and i don t bother you he thought think i dream it
so i took a graduat glass and kind of turn my back to her and pick out a bottl that look all right becaus a man that would keep poison set around in a unlabel bottl ought to be in jail anyway,dead
get me a mattress and a chair and a glass of whiski he say,until mayb the granddaught stir and spoke querul again and he went and quiet her and return to talk to himself again but care now quiet now sinc sutpen wa close enough to hear him easi without shout you know i never

motionless he wa sit against a tree besid a spring is head back hi hand upon hi lap hi face worn and peac he smell and saw negro dish negro food,so it wa not until he fail to return at dinner time that she went or sent clyti to the stabl and found that the mare had foal in the night but that her father wa not there
if he saw anyth at all it wa the child the orphan of five year who had sat with the still and alert and unreck passiv of an anim on the seat of hi buggi on that decemb even twelv year ago,do you see him
found her stand befor that close door which i wa not to enter and which she herself did not enter again to my knowledg until jone and the other man carri the coffin up the stair with the photograph hang at her side and her face absolut calm look at me for a moment and just rais her voic enough to be heard in the hall below clyti,then i can see the top of the barn
at six in the even he return again without even look toward the hous,cash is half turn the rein run taut from hi hand and disappear into the water the other hand reach back upon addi hold her jam over against the high side of the wagon
no more did he have to seek her through the hous the night when he must seek her hidden and pant and nake about the dark hous or among the shrubberi of the ruin park were as dead now as the hollow fencepost below the barn,i took her out there thi even
she stare at me without wink,cash is not listen
when he did so the girl began to make a choke wail sound which would be much louder in a moment as fear gain courag as it were,then it wa too late
save for the rise and fall of the stick and the groan respir of the anim they might have been an equestrian statu stray from it pedest and come to rest in an attitud of ultim exhaust in a quiet and empti street splotch and dappl by moonshadow,he lay still and rigid on hi back with the cold new england night on hi face and the blood run warm in hi rigid bodi and limb breath hard but slow hi eye wide open upon the window think nevermor of peac
but busi start fall off and folk stay so well until one day they found out that the women would nt never get sick at all,pa breath with a quiet rasp sound mouth the snuff against hi gum

thi wa the second messeng it wa in and the messeng wa eat breakfast in the kitchen bolt hi food with decor celer,so quick holler and they stop and he went to the wagon and told them
he had had no breakfast like neither he nor the man had onc thought of that,he wa tell a stori
what he found wa a stranger who put asid with the calm firm of a man hi hand when at last and in a kind of baffl desper he went and touch her,in fact perhap thi is the pure and perfect incest the brother realiz that the sister s virgin must be destroy in order to have exist at all take that virgin in the person of the brotherinlaw the man whom he would be if he could becom metamorphos into the lover the husband by whom he would be despoil choos for despoil if he could becom metamorphos into the sister the mistress the bride
and so she die,he told her quietli and peac lie besid her touch her
ah,then they would be strand as behind a die mistral upon a spent and satiat beach look at one anoth like stranger with hopeless and reproach on hi part with weari on her with despair eye
he watch the back of christma s head,that wa one reason

he did not distinguish hi son s face until the buckboard had stop and the sister had billow shriek through the door,i ain t go to get you mix up in it when it ain t none of your troubl
he spent saturday night in jail still talk about how they were tri to beat him out of hi thousand dollar by tri to make out that he help christma do the kill until at last buck conner went up to hi cell and told him he would put a gag in hi mouth if he didn t shut up and let the other prison sleep,the wind s chang
