p,fell down on top of me laughing and it kept on making the sound and quentin kicked t
p,and caddy put her arms around me and her shining veil and i could not smell trees anymore and i began to cry
benjy caddy said benjy,she put her arms around me again but i went away
what is it benjy,she said

he did not know now any more than when he decided to call whether he was doing the right thing the wrong thing the weak thing or the strong thing,he set the gun on the kitchen table and took down the number carol gave him and hung up without saying anything further
if he were given this role to act in a play how would he do it,how would he do the phone call
in a voice that was trembling or a voice that was firm,with wit or with savagery renunciation or rage
he could no more figure out how to play the elderly lover abandoned by the mistress twentyfive years his junior than he had been able to figure out how to play macbeth,should not he just have blown his brains out while carol was at the other end listening
would not that have been the best way to play it,he could stop of course
he could stop the madness right here,he was not going to win pegeen back by going on to dial asa is number yet he dialed it

the phone rang only once before asa answered and said hello,just how did it benefit you axler began seething shouting resentfully to turn her against me
you could not stand that she was a lesbian in the first place,that is what she saidneither you nor carol could bear it
you were appalled when she told you,well with me she had relinquished all that with me she had opened herself to a new way of lifeand was happy
you never saw the two of us together,pegeen and i were happy
but instead of being grateful to me you persuade her to pick up and leave,even her going back to being a lesbian was preferable to her being with me
why,why
