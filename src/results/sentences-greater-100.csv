135,becaus you will see the letter not the first one he ever wrote to her but at least the first the onli one she ever show as your grandmoth knew then and so we believ now that she is dead the onli one which she kept unless of cours miss rosa or clyti destroy the other after she herself die and thi one here preserv not becaus judith put it away to keep but becaus she brought it herself and gave it to your grandmoth after bon s death possibl on the same day when she destroy the other which he had written her provid of cours it wa she herself who destroy them which would have been when she found in bon s coat the pictur of the octoroon mistress and the littl boy
135,and bon ride besid him tri to find out what sutpen had told who for a year and a half now had been watch henri ape hi cloth and speech who for a year and a half now had seen himself as the object of that complet and abneg devot which onli a youth never a woman give to anoth youth or a man who for exactli a year now had seen the sister succumb to that same spell which the brother had alreadi succumb to and thi with no volit on the seduc s part without so much as the lift of a finger as though it actual were the brother who had put the spell on the sister seduc her to hi own vicari imag which walk and breath with bon s bodi
135,when she came to town now in the madeov dress which all southern women now wore in the carriag still but drawn now by a mule a plow mule soon the plow mule and no coachman to drive it either to put the mule in the har and take it out to join the other were wound in jefferson the improvis hospit where the nurtur virgin the suprem and tradit idl they clean and dress the selffoul bodi of strang injur and dead and made lint of the window curtain and sheet and linen of the hous in which they had been born there were none to ask her about brother and sweetheart while they talk among themselv of son and brother and husband with tear and grief perhap but at least with certainti knowledg
135,it wa like that he said like an bright glare that vanish and left noth no ash nor refus just a limitless flat plain with the sever shape of hi intact innoc rise from it like a monument that innoc instruct him as calm as the other had ever spoken use hi own rifl analog to do it with and when it said them in place of he or him it meant more than all the human puni mortal under the sun that might lie in hammock all afternoon with their shoe off he thought if you were fix to combat them that had the fine rifl the first thing you would do would be to get yourself the nearest thing to a fine rifl you could borrow or steal or make would nt it
135,and he stand there with the rein over hi arm with perhap someth like smile insid hi beard and about the eye which wa not smile but the crinkl concentr of furiou hast the need for it the urgenc but not fear not concern just the fact that he had miss that time though luckili it wa just a spot shot with a light charg and the old gun the old barrel and carriag none the wors onli next time there might not be enough powder for both a spot shot and then a fullsiz fact that the thread of shrewd and courag and will ran onto the same spool which the thread of hi remain day ran onto and that spool almost near enough for him to reach out hi hand and touch it
135,but i do i have it is irrevoc now if you discern aught in thi letter which smack of humil take it as come not from the mother and certainli not from the son but from the pen of one whose humbl posit as legal advis and man of busi to the abov describ ladi and young gentleman whose loyalti and gratitud toward one whose generos ha found him i do not confess thi i proclaim it in bread and meat and fire and shelter over a period long enough to have taught him gratitud and loyalti even if he had not known them ha led him into an action whose mean fall behind it intent for the reason that he is onli what he is and profess himself to be not what he would
135,but he had learn to read in spanish from the priest in california and as soon as the child could walk burden he pronounc it burden now sinc he could not spell it at all and the priest had taught him to write it labori so with a hand more apt for a rope or a gunbutt or a knife than a pen began to read to the child in spanish from the book which he had brought with him from california interspers the fine sonor flow of mystic in a foreign tongu with harsh extemporis dissert compos half of the bleak and bloodless logic which he rememb from hi father on intermin new england sunday and half of immedi hellfir and tangibl brimston of which ani countri methodist circuit rider would have been proud
134,he might not have gone out of hi way to keep sutpen in jail but doubtless the best possibl moral fumig which sutpen could have receiv at the time in the eye of hi fellow citizen wa the fact that mr coldfield sign hi bond someth he would not have done to save hi own good name even though the arrest had been a direct result of the busi between himself and sutpen that affair which when it reach a point where hi conscienc refus to sanction it he had withdrawn from and let sutpen take all the profit refus even to allow sutpen to reimburs him for the loss which in withdraw he had suffer though he did permit hi daughter to marri thi man of whose action hi conscienc did not approv
134,not a tether just a light block of some sort so he cant get insid of anyth that might have a fenc around it and onli him to tri to check it or as much as he dare and not get far becaus he knew too that all bon had to do wa to go to hi mother and the race hors would have a gold eatingtrough if he want it and if the jock wa nt care a new jockey too count up the money figur what he would net at thi normal rate over the next few year and meanwhil crucifi between hi two problem whether mayb what he ought to do wa to wash hi hand of the sutpen angl and clean up what wa left and light out for texa
134,it wa shreve speak though save for the slight differ which the interven degre of latitud had inculc in them differ not in tone or pitch but of turn of phrase and usag of word it might have been either of them and wa in a sens both both think as one the voic which happen to be speak the thought onli the think becom audibl vocal the two of them creat between them out of the ragtag and bobend of old tale and talk peopl who perhap had never exist at all anywher who shadow were shadow not of flesh and blood which had live and die but shadow in turn of what were to one of them at least to shreve shade too quiet as the visibl murmur of their vapor breath
134,old sabin who could nt to save her life have told you or the lawyer or bon or anybodi els probabl what she want expect hope for becaus she wa a woman and did nt need to want or hope or expect anyth but just to want and expect and hope and besid your father said that when you have plenti of good strong hate you do nt need hope becaus the hate will be enough to nourish you the old sabin not so old yet but she would have just let herself go in the sens that you keep the engin clean and oil and the best of coal in the bunker but you do nt bother to shine the brightwork or holyston the deck anymor just let herself go on the outsid
134,and then the paper could be still again becaus he would be talk about a small colleg onli ten year old about how there would nt be anyth to distract him from hi studi there where in a sens wisdom herself would be a virgin or at least not veri secondhand and how he would have a chanc to observ anoth and a provinci section of the countri in which hi high destini wa root grant the outcom of thi war which wa without doubt immin the success conclus of which we all hope for had no doubt of as the man he would be and the econom power he would repres when hi mother pass on and he listen behind that express say then you do nt recommend the law as a vocat
133,so that he must have appear not onli to henri but to the entir undergradu bodi of that small new provinci colleg as a sourc not of envi becaus you onli envi whom you believ to be but for accid in no way superior to yourself and what you believ grant a littl better luck than you have had heretofor you will someday possess not of envi but of despair that sharp shock terribl hopeless despair of the young which sometim take the form of insult toward and even physic assault upon the human subject of it or in extrem case like henri s insult toward and assault upon ani and all detractor of the subject as wit henri s violent repudi of hi father and hi birthright when sutpen forbad the marriag
133,but he ha money he will and stop with that forlorn littl boy invis between them who had come there eight year ago with the overal jumper over what remain of hi silk and broadcloth who had becom the youth in the tatter hat and the hi ancient curs who had becom the young man with a young man s potenc yet wa still that lone child in hi parchmentanddenim hairshirt and your grandfath speak the lame vain word the speciou and empti fallaci which we call comfort think better that he were dead better that he had never live then think what vain and empti recapitul that would be to her if he were to say it who doubtless had alreadi said it thought it chang onli the person and the number
133,all the time he wa speak he wa sit on the log grandfath said tell it make the gestur to tell it with the man grandfath himself had seen fight nake chest to chest with one of hi wild nigger by the light of the camp fire while hi hous wa build and who still fought with them by lantern light in the stabl after he had got at last that wife who would be adjunct to the forward of that design he had in mind and no bone made about the fight either no handshak and gratul while he wash the blood off and don hi shirt becaus at the end of it the nigger would be flat on hi back with hi chest heav and anoth nigger throw water on him
132,she heard of that too while she wa spend her day and night she would have to wait until her father wa asleep sew tedious and without skill on the garment which she wa make for her niec s trousseau and which she had to keep hidden not onli from her father but from the two negress who might have told mr lace out of ravel and hoard string and thread and sew it onto garment while news came of lincoln s elect and of the fall of sumpter and she scarc listen hear and lose the knell and doom of her nativ land between two tediou and clumsi stitch on a garment which she would never wear and never remov for a man whom she wa not even to see aliv
132,i did not say one of the thousand trivial thing with which the indomit womanblood ignor the man s world in which the blood kinsman show the courag or cowardic the folli or lust or fear for which hi fellow prais or crucifi him who came and crash a door and cri hi crime and vanish who for the fact that he wa still aliv wa just that much more shadowi than the abstract which we had nail into a shot heard onli by it echo a strang gaunt halfwild hors bridl and with empti saddl the saddl bag contain a pistol a worn clean shirt a lump of ironlik bread captur by a man four mile away and two day later while tri to forc the crib door in hi stabl
132,all of a sudden he discov not what he want to do but what he just had to do had to do it whether he want to or not becaus if he did not do it he knew that he could never live with himself for the rest of hi life never live with what all the men and women that had die to make him had left insid of him for him to pass on with all the dead one wait and watch to see if he wa go to do it right fix thing right so that he would be abl to look in the face not onli the old dead one but all the live one that would come after him when he would be one of the dead
132,he found out that she wa up to someth and he not onli did nt care he did nt even care that he did nt know what it wa he got older and found out that she had been shape and temper him to be the instrument for whatev it wa her hand wa implac for mayb came to believ or saw that she had trick him into receiv that shape and temper and did nt care about that too becaus probabl by that time he had learn that there were three thing and no more breath pleasur dark and without money there could be no pleasur and without pleasur it would not even be breath but mere protoplasm inhal and collaps of blind unorgan in a dark where light never began
131,not like a man who had been peac ill in bed and had recov to move with a sort of diffid and tent amaz in a world which he had believ himself on the point of surrend but like a man who had been through some solitari furnac experi which wa more than just fever like an explor ay who not onli had to face the normal hardship of the pursuit which he chose but wa overtaken by the ad and unforeseen handicap of the fever also and fought through it at enorm cost not so much physic as mental alon and unaid and not through blind instinct will to endur and surviv but to gain and keep to enjoy it the materi prize for which he accept the origin gambit
131,and on the four or five occas dure the year when ellen would bring the children in to spend the day at her father s the aunt that strong vindict consist woman who seem to have been twice the man that mr coldfield wa and who in veri truth wa not onli miss rosa s mother but her father too cast over these visit also that same atmospher of grim embattl conspiraci and allianc against the two adversari one of he could have held hi own or not had long sinc drawn in hi picquet and dismantl hi artilleri and retir into the impregn citadel of hi passiv rectitud and the probabl could have engag and even rout them but who did not even know that he wa an embattl foe
131,and it dire inde becaus now the pass negro servant go to work in white see her befor sunup gather green along garden fenc pull them through the fenc sinc she had no garden of her own no seed to plant one with no tool to work it with herself even if she had known complet how who had had onli the freshman year at garden and doubtless would not have work it if she had known reach through the garden fenc and gather veget though she would have been welcom to enter the garden and get them and they would have even done the gather and sent them to her sinc there were more peopl than judg benbow who would leav basket of provis on her front porch at night
131,not clyti who guard him as if he were a spanish virgin who even befor she could have even suspect that he would ever come there to live had interrupt hi first contact with a nigger and sent him back to the hous not judith who could have refus at ani time to let him sleep in that white child s bed in her room who even if she could not have reconcil herself to hi sleep on the floor could have forc clyti to take him into anoth bed with her who would have made a monk a celib of him perhap yet not a eunuch who may not have permit him to pass himself for a foreign yet who certainli would not have driven him to consort with negro
131,in the overcoat button awri over the bathrob he look huge and shapeless like a dishevel bear as he stare at quentin the southern whose blood ran quick to cool more suppl to compens for violent chang of temperatur perhap perhap mere nearer the surfac who sat hunch in hi chair hi hand thrust into hi pocket as if he were tri to hug himself warm between hi arm look somehow fragil and even wan in the lamplight the rosi glow which now had noth of warmth cozi in it while both their breath vapor faintli in the cold room where there wa now not two of them but four the two who breath not individu now yet someth both more and less than twin the heart and blood of youth
130,becaus the time now approach it wa even mr coldfield probabl admit that war wa unavoid when the destini of sutpen s famili which for twenti year now had been like a lake well from quiet spring into a quiet valley and spread rise almost impercept and in which the four member of it float in sunni suspens felt the first subterranean movement toward the outlet the gorg which would be the land s catastroph too and the four peac swimmer turn suddenli to face one anoth not yet with alarm or distrust but just alert feel the dark set none of them yet at that point where man look about at hi companion in disast and think when will i stop tri to save them and save onli myself
130,and who to say if it wa nt mayb the possibl of incest becaus who without a sister i do nt know about the other ha been in love and not discov the vain evanesc of the fleshli encount who ha not had to realiz that when the brief all is done you must retreat from both love and pleasur gather up your own rubbish and hat and pant and shoe which you drag through the retreat sinc the god condon and practis these and the dreami immeasur coupl which float oblivi abov the tramel and harri instant the wasnot is wa is a perquisit onli of ballooni and weightless eleph and whale but mayb if there were sin too mayb you would not be permit to escap uncoupl return
129,so for the first sixteen year of her life she live in that grim tight littl hous with the father whom she hate without know queer silent man whose onli companion and friend seem to have been hi conscienc and the onli thing he care about hi reput for probiti among hi fellow men that man who wa later to nail himself in hi attic and starv to death rather than look upon hi nativ land in the throe of repel an invad the aunt who even ten year later wa still take reveng for the fiasco of ellen s wed by strike at the town the human race through ani and all of it creatur brother niec nephewinlaw herself and the blind irrat furi of a shed snake
129,that wa i i wa there someth of me walk in measur cadenc with the measur tread of jone and hi companion and theophilu mccaslin who had heard the news somehow back in town and clyti as we bore the awkward and unmanag box past the stair s close turn while judith follow steadi it from behind and so down and out to the wagon someth of me help to rais that which it could not have rais alon yet which it still could not believ into the wait wagon someth of me stood besid the gashi earth in the cedar somber gloom and heard the clumsi knell of clod upon the wood and answer no when judith at the grave s wound end said he wa a cathol
129,it broke down it vanish into that old impot logic and moral which had betray him befor and what day might it have been what furrow might he have stop dead in on foot advanc the unsenti plow handl in hi instantan unsenti hand what fenc panel held in midair as though it had no weight by muscl which could not rid it when he realiz that there wa more in hi problem than just lack of time that the problem contain some superdistil of thi lack that he wa now past sixti and that possibl he could get but one more son had at best but one more son in hi loin as the old cannon might know when it ha just one more shot in it corpor
128,thi wa my instant who could have fled then and did not who found that he had gone on and did not rememb when he had walk away who found my okra bed finish without rememb the complet of it who sat at the supper tabl that night with the familiar dreamcloudi shell which we had grown use to he did not look at me again dure the meal i might have said then to what delud sewergush of dream doe the incorrig flesh betray us but i did not and then befor the fire in judith s bedroom sat as we alway did until he came in the door and look at us and said judith you and and ceas still enter then said no never mind

127,sinc he want so littl could have understood if the other had want the signal to be in secret would have been quick and glad to let it be in secret even if he could not have understood whi think in the middl of thi my god i am young young and i did nt even know it they did nt even tell me that i wa young feel that same despair and shame like when you have to watch your father fail in physic courag think it should have been me that fail me i not he who stem from that blood which we both bear befor it could have becom corrupt and taint by whatev it wa in mother s that he could not brook
127,i will do anyth he might ask me to do and that is whi he will never ask me to do anyth that i consid dishonor so that mayb he even kiss her that time the first time she had ever been kiss mayb and she too innoc to be coy or modest or even to know that she had been tempor with mayb afterward just look at him with a kind of peac and blank surpris at the fact that your sweetheart appar kiss you the first time like your brother of cours that your brother ever thought of could be brought to kiss you on the mouth that when the two day were up and he wa gone again and ellen shriek at her what

126,there wa an ogr of my childhood which befor my birth remov my onli sister to it grim ogrebourn and produc two half phantom children whom i wa not encourag and did not desir to associ with as if my lateborn solitud had taught me presenti of that fate intertwin warn me of that fatal snarli climax befor i knew the name for i forgav it there wa a shape which rode away beneath a flag and demon or no courag i did more than just forgiv i slew it becaus the bodi the blood the memori which that ogr had dwelt in return five year later and held out it hand and said come as you might say it to a dog and i came
126,and that night they final found him and fetch him home in a wagon and carri him quiet and bloodi and with hi teeth still show in hi part beard which wa hardli grizzl although hi hair wa almost white now in the light of the lantern and the pine torch up the step where the tearless and stonefac daughter held the door open for him too who use to like to drive fast to church and who rode fast there thi time onli when it wa all over he had never reach the church sinc the daughter decid that he should be driven into that same methodist church in town where he had marri her mother befor return to the grave in the cedar grove
126,to lead them around the ditch and he and hi father cross just as the rain began to come down again gray and solid and slow make no sound quentin not awar yet of just where they were becaus he had been ride with hi head lower against the drizzl until he look up the slope befor them where the wet yellow sedg die upward into the rain like melt gold and saw the grove the clump of cedar on the crest of the hill dissolv into the rain as if the tree had been drawn in ink on a wet cedar beyond which beyond the ruin field beyond which would be the oak grove and the gray huge rot desert hous half a mile away
126,and he would nt know nor care about that either which of or wa who decid he should go to school nor whi becaus he had known all the time that hi mother wa up to someth and that the lawyer wa up to someth and he did nt care enough about what either of them wa to tri to find out who knew that the lawyer knew that hi mother wa up to someth but that hi mother did nt know that the lawyer wa up to someth and that it would be all right with the lawyer if hi mother got whatev it wa she want provid he the lawyer got what he want one second befor or at least at the same time
125,but the legend of sutpen s wild negro wa not to begin at onc becaus the wagon went on as though even the wood and iron which compos it as well as the mule which drew it had becom imbu by sheer associ with him with that qualiti of gaunt and tireless drive that convict for hast and of flee time later sutpen told quentin s grandfath that on that afternoon when the wagon pass through jefferson they had been without food sinc the previou night and that he wa tri to reach sutpen s hundr and the river bottom to tri to kill a deer befor dark so he and the architect and the negro would not have to spend anoth night without food
